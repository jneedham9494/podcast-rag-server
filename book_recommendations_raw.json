      "text": "Thank you so much for coming on the podcast. My pleasure. Maybe coming back to the podcast. Initially, the Twitch stream now finally on the podcast feed. Oh, yeah. Benjamin Bratton's work spans philosophy, computer science and geopolitics. He is a professor of philosophy of technology and speculative design at the University of California, San Diego. He is the director of anti-cathira, a think tank on the speculative philosophy of computation. He is also a professor of digital design at the European Graduate School, as well as a visiting professor at CYARC and NYU Shanghai. He is the author of several books, including The Stack, on software and sovereignty, from MIT Press in 2016. When I encountered that book, I read both The Stack and inventing a future back-to-back in the same year. And that just so thoroughly shaped the conversations within my peer group. It was tremendously formative. His other books include The Revenge of the Real, Politics for a Post-Pandemic World, from Versopress in 2021. We happen to have read this in the Do Not Research Book Club. Thoroughly enjoyed that one. That's on the, I think the second or third syllabus. Highly recommend picking that up. And additionally, you are the author of The Terraforming in 2019. And I think I saw a tweet that you are now republishing and updating The Terraforming. Is that correct? I am. Yeah. That version of the book that you're speaking to was written as a kind of manifesto for a design research think tank that I was running, or co-running with Nikolai Boisev at the Strelke Institute in Moscow. The institute is a whole, closed down as soon as the war started. And with it, the book went out of print. That program itself generated such a huge amount of work, ideas, and so forth. That's MIT Press invited me to revisit the manuscript, revisit the book, and to update it, both to reflect on the arguments that were made in the book, and also to tally some of the work that had been done. So that's one of my current book projects now. Yeah. I feel like there's been so much advancement in the field of geoengineering specifically. Are there new chapters, new topics being added to the book? Because between 2021 and 23, I feel like the entire field has undergone some significant transformations. Yeah, it has. And I should say that before your listeners hang up, all of a sudden as they hear the word geoengineering, that I think for us the term, the way we tried to sort of rescue the term, and perhaps totally unsuccessfully, was to think of geoengineering not as a portfolio of weird Dr. Evil technologies, but rather to expand the concept to include any kind of deliberate intervention within planetary systems that has planetary scale effects. And so there could be highly technological forms of geoengineering such as direct air carbon capture, and there could be very passive kinds of geoengineering, let's say, like ensuring that the Amazon rainforest will return to a pre-Columbian footprint so that it becomes a carbon sink once again. The effect in terms of this may be very similar. And so whether or not something is highly technological or not technological is less the point. I think it's important, at least for us to couch it in this way, in relationship to the terraforming thesis itself, which in a nutshell went like this, that what we call the anthropocene or capulocene, or whenever you want to call it, needs to be recognized as having had terraforming scale effects. We are living inside the terraforming now. You think it began 50 years ago, 200 years ago, 10,000 years ago with agriculture, it doesn't, you know, in geological time, it's all the same, but that this terraforming in which we, you know, that has produced us, each of us is an output of this terraforming, it was largely planless and not deliberate. It was an emergent effect of a number of smaller systems. So that's one terraforming. The second terraforming would be the realization that no matter what we do, and, you know, again, putting a question who the we is, and of course, no matter what we do at this point, we all go full kazinsky tomorrow, that human civilizations in plural will continue to have terraforming scale effects over the course of the next centuries. And so in a way, it's not optional. And then the third one, which was really the focus of the book and the program would be, well, given these, what is the, what would be the terraforming that is deliberate, that is compositional, that does understand and take as a basis of its approach, that the most effective and viable responses to anthropogenic climate change will be equally anthropogenic, will be equally anthropogenic. And if we sort of embrace rather than fear, or rather embrace the artificiality that is necessary to compose a viable planetarity, this shifts a lot of the conversations around, you know, relationships between nature and technology, politics and governance, society and ecology, so forth and so on. And so for us, just to square the circle, geoengineering in that expanded sense would be a name for all the ways in which that third terraforming could try to compose and plan some of these outcomes. Now, you're exactly right, however, that things like direct-to-carbon capture have been widely, you know, this huge amounts of capital going into that, which I think is largely in that positive, though, you know, whether or not that it ends up being a kind of placebo investment, which is hard to say. But even on those that portfolio of technologies, I think it's important to recognize that there's certain kinds of geoengineering that we probably should be doing absolutely as fast as we possibly can by any means necessary, such as pulling greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere so that decarbonization has a chance to actually sort of put tilt things in our favor. And other kinds of geoengineering that you hope you never have to do, like solar radiation management. Right. And so given that, I just, it doesn't make sense to think about one being pro or anti-geoengineering as if it's a single knob that you can turn more or less. It's considerably more nuanced than that. And I think those are some of the ways in which we try to explore the idea and the terraforming program and will be developed further in that book. On this question of artificiality, what you alluded to before this question of we, your current research project is called Theory and Design in the Age of Machine Intelligence. I think there's a, I mean, one of the things that has been most interesting to me in terms of the conversations unfolding around AI is the possibility to do climate intervention and climate planning. Maybe you can tell us to start just a bit about your current research project. Yeah, gosh, there's a few of them. So I'll try to keep them aligned. But on the main point that you're suggesting about this relationship with an AI and climate, I think there's, there's ways in which this can get talked about in ways that are really superficial and sort of will add some more AI to it and will just make the system smarter and will all work out. And then there's ways of thinking about it that I think are probably more, more fundamental and perhaps more profound. One of these would be to foreground the understanding that the very idea of climate change itself is an epistemological accomplishment of planetary scale computation that without the satellite sensors, the surface surface sensors, oceanic temperature sensors, and most importantly, massive supercomputing simulations of climatic past, present and future against which the models are, are projective models of the year 2050 are derived. The idea of climate change is just not, it's just not, it's not available. The concept of the planetary that arrives from our understanding of climate change in this way, our understanding of anthropogenic agency as a whole, arguably the very idea of the anthropocene itself that comes from a reckoning with the implications of anthropogenic climate change. These are all first and second order effects of planetary computation as what I call an after-standers-level and epistemological technology, one that discloses how the world works to us. To approach your question, what is the relationship between AI and climate? I would want to first begin with the understanding that we can only have this conversation because of planetary computation and that inevitably frames that. I think the issue of the relationship between AI and climate science is one that's very important in terms of the ways in which we can model and measure planetary systems, understand planetary boundaries, quantify and predict and simulate the effects of different kinds of interventions, and ultimately, in principle, become the basis of a reorganization of both industrial and information economies in relation to the implications of those simulations. Which makes our strange thing to say, but look, climate politics as it exists now is, to the extent to which it's based on, we want to prevent the implications of these models of what the year 2050 or the year 2070 is going to be like. We have a model of what 1.5 Celsius or three degrees Celsius is going to look like. This future must be prevented. This future must be prevented. We want to mobilize a new planetary politics around the implications of a computational simulation. It'd be difficult to convince extinction rebellion that that's in fact what they're up to, that they basically have put computational simulation at the center of an emergent planetary politics, but in essence, that's what it is. And so to a certain extent of the way we answer questions, not how could this happen hypothetically, but rather how can we make more explicit the ways in which this is a precondition of everything we've been doing all along? I think I'm putting these two things in conversation, certain technologies like geoengineering, specifically maybe solar radiation management and comparing that to AI because I'm interested in what is the teleology of AI? This is what I'm trying to grasp. And when I read the stack in 2016, I was having conversations with my peers that Instagram turned every artwork into a photograph that was very straightforward. We knew that Twitter had turned all journalists and politicians into influencers diving deeper into these conversations. It became very clear that platforms were assuming roles and tasks typically reserved for the state. And that's a total transformation of the conversations we were having previously that all of a sudden looked very superficial. And I'm seeing a similar thing now with AI. My entire peer group are artists and journalists and so on and they're over indexing their own interest. In many cases, we see people using AI to make cool pictures. We're worried it's going to automate journalism. And I'm trying to think beyond this that what is the political economic implication of this technology? So when I juxtaposed that against geoengineering, one could imagine that if Nevada decides to undergo solar radiation management and they spray silver or aluminum particles into the air, there's no way that that technology is going to be constrained to the artificial borders. And probably California is going to get pretty mad about that. And I'm wondering what the teleology of AI is. If there is something, maybe the easiest example is intellectual property that AI does not necessarily respect the intellectual property protected by certain states and not others. So different models will scrape the web and they'll take it from different people. And one sovereignty may not abide by the arbitrary rules of another. Is there something intrinsic to AI that extends beyond our 20th century conception of states? It's an excellent set of questions that you ask. So I'll break it down into a couple smaller ones and maybe build it back up from there if that's all right. The relationship between planetary computation and jurisdiction and Westphalia and nation states and borders and stuff is one of the key arguments from that book, which is, you know, I wrote now 10 years ago, that key argument was basically that as you observed the cloud platforms and even back then it was, at least, obviously, to me, we're taking on more and more roles of traditionally assigned in nation states, identity, cartography, currency, and that they were operating at it, but operating at a transnational scale. And in many cases had market valuations that were greater, many, many orders of magnitude greater than the GDPs of many nations. And clearly this represented a kind of shift in the underlying technologies of governance. It also suggests it made very clear in ways that I think political science is just now catching up with all politics and all governance is to certain extent technologically determined by what it's possible for states to sense and model and recursively respond to. But the inverse was also true. And I think this is the part where I tried to make the case emphatically then, but I think it's a little more obvious now that also states evolve into and through whatever those technical means that are available at their disposal and they always have. And so to say that clouds, states are evolving into cloud platforms as much as cloud platforms are evolving into states. I think you see this, you know, think of China's digital belt and road initiative, think of US transnational jurisdiction over intellectual property rights, think of the Stony as a citizenship. I mean, as many examples as you want to kind of go down, this extension of state services into cloud-based state services has fundamental implications for the spatial and temporal distribution of what states are what they do. Okay, so the correlation between your example of solar radiation management leaking across borders is obviously true, right? The old Carl Sagan line molecules don't have passports. They don't move across this and to a certain extent neither do bits and until they do, until they do, until there's some kind of artificial intervention like a great firewall of China that actually does try to claim to drive sovereignty from claiming jurisdiction over data. And this is important. It's not just that it's claiming that we have sovereignty and therefore we have jurisdiction over this data. The sovereignty itself is derived from that claim, which is also, I think, a very interesting and interesting shift. But let me speak to AI, which is, I think, where you wanted to head with this. I think to cut to the chase, I think there's one way of looking at this in the short term and a little bit more zoomed in. It's a reasonable set, an important set of questions about what will be the impact that widespread use of large foundational models will have on the functions of states as we know them, on the competitive adversarial relationship between states. Clearly the adversarial dynamics between US and China increasingly are being fought over who has the resources and capacities to build their own hemispherical stack, preventing chips manufacturing and other kinds of expertise and minerals and so forth that you may even put this way that the multipolarization of geopolitics that we've seen over the last five or 10 years and the multipolarization of planetary computation of it segmenting into a kind of US stack, a China stack, a European stack and so forth. These phenomena not only track each other, I argue that they're, in fact, the same thing, that they're same thing. That as governance becomes imminent in the cognitive infrastructures of planetary computation, that the production of governing capacity is the same thing as the production of that infrastructural capacity. Okay, now to the art and culture aspect of this, let me just say, I think if you zoom out further at, let's say, like, 100 years time span or a thousand year time span and you look at a moment over the period from the middle of the 20th century to what would be the middle of the 21st century, let's say, the emergence of planetary computation and then the emergence of planetary machine intelligence, all appearing rather suddenly in the broad scheme of things in terms of biological history or geological history. I think that raises a different set of questions about what's going on and what are we living through and what are we creating and we're certainly seeing how inevitable or evidentable the emergence of machine intelligence may have been, which is, again, I think that as you telescope in and out, the kinds of questions that it's relevant to ask, I think, become different. Yes. So let me zoom all the way back into, I think the more immediate questions you're asking about art and culture production and shifts in labor, dynamics and the rest of this as well. I like this line that you said about the Instagram turned all art into pictures and it did. I mean, the sense to which, like, Spotify turns all albums into a database in which everything is in the present, right? And all music is both old and new. It's just, it doesn't matter. It's just all database time. I think the next step is, I think, recognition that what AI does is it turns all art and culture into training data, which is not necessarily the same thing as image. And I think one of the things you're seeing now, which is very interesting, is the way in which people who are creative, they produce texts and write, like I do, or produce images or sounds or other kinds of things that are through which we communicate symbolically to one another, beginning to realize that this question of the culture of production as a form of training data is not just something that happens after the thing is produced. It's not just I produce a culture object and then it goes on the shelf as training data, but that the training data dynamic is now increasingly part of the creative process. There's a self-reflexivity by which people are understanding the thing that they're creating in relationship to the model, that the thing will be informing. And how do you influence the model, relate to this model, evade the model, poison the model, poison the data, all these kinds of things are increasingly part of this. Now, one way to think about this is, I think, is very complex and the IP issues are obviously complex as well. One way to think about this, and I'm not necessarily suggesting it's the only appropriate way to think about this, but one way to think about this is that it might make us a bit more suspicious of the idea of personal data and personal individual, authorial production in relationship to the larger model in the same way that the pandemic and the ways in which information about the spread of a virus or the distribution patterns of contagion, I think made it clear to everyone. We all became amateur epidemiologists for a year or so, that the idea of data itself isn't individuated. It doesn't really individuated in the same way in which your story about California and Nevada, trying to keep you engineering inside the artificial boundaries of Nevada. In the context, epidemiological context, the pandemic, when you realize that my exhale is your inhale, your exhale is my inhale, like whose event is this? And the borders of the individual is the basis to try to identify the base unit of data doesn't really work. And we may be seeing a similar kind of thing in relationship to the way in which creative people think about the relationship to the model, that the construction of the model, the way in which the model then becomes a resource and a basis to produce further work, because the model is not only the thing that the work goes into after it's made, it's also the thing through which the work is made in the first place. You use the model to make new work. And so one way of thinking about this is that things are shifting towards a kind of mode of production that is both totally centralized in that these are being run through a handful, single digit, you know, increasingly a single digit number of large models, perhaps, that's one future, but also totally decentralized in the sense that there's an access and ability to both produce with this model and to train in different kinds of ways. I guess my answer is a little bit more zoomed out than maybe you were pending, but I'm trying to think about the emergence of models as both the medium, but the tool with which culture is made, the medium through which culture is distributed, and this place to which culture is, yes, it's exported around this is work. And then I think this goes to the question of how models become governing tools and governing technologies as well, of which the cultural form is just a key example. I think that's exactly right. A big part of my question is what is the appropriate scope to have these conversations through? And we can slide between the 10-year frame or the 100-year frame or the 1000-year frame. I've been in a lot of conversations with different peers over the last few months, and I feel like there's two kind of competing metaphrames that are at work right now. One of them is a teleology of history, the Higalian or Marxist understanding of history that we progress to feudalism, followed by capitalism, then socialism and eventually communism. And there's this other competing theory now that human society is organized as kingdoms into states and then into networks. Depending on the scope that you're talking about within the 100-year timeframe, I find that to be very improbable. My position has always been that states are actually incredibly resilient. I have, I think, a beef with a neoliberal theory of money and value that for states to provision themselves and to direct their economies, a centralized governing authority is absolutely necessary. Even for the enormous cost of some of these technologies to undergo any sort of geo-engineering or terraforming or what-have-you, that really does require monetary sovereignty. I don't think that is possible to accomplish through their private sector. But the idea that we are going to break apart the existing structure of nation-states within a thousand-year scope, I'm willing to entertain that within like a very long timeframe for sure. We're kind of trapped in this Fukuyama conversation, that is, the terrible hangover of the 20th century. And I'm just feeling like there's some type of political economic conversation that necessarily surrounds these transformations of society. I think as you said in this excellent lecture at trust in Berlin, our good friends from trust in humanity rising was the title of the lecture, that politics and technology circumscribe one another. So I'm trying to understand where these things fit into each other and yeah, how that kind of relates to some of the previous frames of the existence of states provisioning your economy and whether AI strengthens that thesis or if it becomes the crowbar through which it begins to disintegrate. The question of history and teleology is an interesting one and it's also one that looks very different depending on the scale by which you look through it. But there's also, I think you begin to see patterns of convergence that cannot really be explained just as form of accidents. We see examples of what's called conversion to evolution in biological systems all over the place, that there are very similar kinds of phenotypes and animal and biological morphologies emerge from completely different kinds of niches. Famous enough that you have crabs for example, evolved lots of times and you just have certain kind of conditions and you get crabs and they're actually not related to one another. And so how do you explain this as just purely accidental? There has to be some kind of not teleology, it was the way not the way I would put it, I would call it path dependency. That is like if you if you if you have a certain set of circumstances that you know each one kind of scaffolding on the other like if then and then you build this and then you build that and then you build that. Every time you're doing it, you're kind of constraining the frame of possibilities to a certain degree and that you may have outcomes that are more common to one another than than would have been otherwise. And so there may be ways of sort of thinking through this or another classic example is octopus and human intelligence. That the earliest common ancestor between self-lapods and humans was not only before, was so far in the past that neither one of these creatures started on a path that anywhere near would have gotten into the kinds of intelligence that they exhibit now. And so both cephalopods and tetrahedobody plan mammals became intelligent in different ways but through completely different paths. And to a certain extent and atomically, neurologically there are significant differences between the ways in which mammals and cephalopods are intelligent particularly relationships with their skin, the central nervous system and all kinds of things. But there's a loss also a lot that's in common at a neurological level, at a cognitive level, other kinds of things as well which in terms of the relationship between vision and light and processing these kinds of things which suggests that at this really zoomed out perspective, teleology might not be the right word but a certain kind of path dependency that suggests one certain conditions are met that the next thing, certain next things are likely to happen in different kinds of ways. Now it gets tricky and dangerous when you zoom in from that scale into the scale of social history because it's easy to kind of take models like this and project them on social and cultural history and sort of apathenically find patterns that aren't really there and that can erect you actively naturalize or justify phenomenon or outcomes that are in fact highly contingent and highly arbitrary in ways that you would want to avoid. The other end of the spectrum, there's probably a lot of part, I think part of the long standing residue of anthropocentric humanism is the presumption that the reality in which we live, the worlds that we construct are entirely the results of our cultures, entirely the results of human societies that we have complete control over this remaking of it and that just think otherwise is a certain sense offensive. One of my favorite historians is a University of Chicago's name is Deepest Chocolate Barty and different parts of his work, I think relevant here, but one of the key ideas is he asks us to think about history at three different levels that there's a social history which is sort of the history of Hagle and Marx and the dialectic and the machinations of money and currency and states and wars and different kinds of material economies and so forth, which is relatively new. We're talking about something that's maybe 10,000, 50,000 years and in the modern sense it's matter of centuries. Then there's a biological history and it's a species history that goes back 150,000 years, 200,000 years, 3 million years the first humans and then there's a geologic history which the structures of the planet and the preconditions by which complex life emerges on the planet that sets the conditions for things that happen subsequently, subsequently to this and he offers the structure as a way of interpreting the implications of the Anthropocene and the way in which he asks us to do this is to instead of seeing the Anthropocene as a kind of giant text as a kind of a framework by which the internal models of our cultures and our societies have sort of projected themselves on the world in such a way that if we can just recalibrate our culture that we will remake the world in the image because of course our culture is causing the reality, this kind of Lamarkey and socioconstructivism, you want to do the other way around, you want to understand that all of our cultural processes, capacity for language, capacity for thought, capacity for any of these kinds of things in complex organizations are fundamentally embedded within biological and geological histories that not only precedes us and make us possible but are now being artificialized by us in ways that are unprecedented. So at the level in which I think we're talking about it's not really clear to what extent is large scale AI, the transformation of planetary computation into an intelligent cognitive infrastructure, to what extent is that a path dependency that will almost inevitably produce certain kinds of economies, political configurations, effects on population dynamics, does it, you know, we end up with fewer people with more people with more war with less war, is is there a way in which if you construct this as a planetary infrastructure that inevitably there's going to be certain kinds of outcomes that the best we can hope for is to kind of steer them a little bit while we still can and really what we should be anticipating is that all of these 18 century institutions like states and parliaments and armies and the rest of this are essentially going to be remade at a fundamental level by this, by this technology. Yes. On the other hand, on the other hand, to what extent do we look at this and say, well, it could actually go a lot of different directions, like the cone of possibility for how AI is going to transform states and societies and economies. There is some path dependency, but at the local scale in which we live our history, that path dependency itself is so incredibly wide as like a cone of possibility that really what we're doing now over the next five or 10 years is determining kind of the initial conditions, the initial conditions by which the subsequent dynamics and evolution are going to take place, within the local scale which we live our lives, the range of possibilities is actually incredibly wide. I think both of these are true. I think both of these are true and it's possible to hold both of these in mind at the same time that there is a kind of a big picture, a kind of, I don't want to say inevitability, but again, a kind of path dependency in the ways in which these are structured. I think it opens the question to a certain extent how much was the emergence of machine intelligence inevitable at some point in time? And to what extent is it evidentable? What extent is it something that actually has a high degree of contingency built into it? This dynamic between contingency and determinacy is one that is extremely interesting and important way of looking through these kinds of questions. We have to be able to think about essentially both at the same time. We have to be able to understand the contingent elements and the deterministic elements within the system. I see an incredible moment of historical irony where so many of the conversations around AI are focusing on the possibilities of doing economic planning or completing the dream of economic planning. I think of Cybersin in its original instantiation has the computational capacity of a Game Boy essentially. It's not a meaningful experiment to organize a complex advanced industrial economy, but AI really fundamentally transforms that. Lee Phillips, I talked to on the podcast, his example of Walmart as a functioning plan economy. I'm seeing this very interesting thing being set up where American venture capitalists are pouring extraordinary amounts of funds into a technology that would complete the project of the Soviet Union. So I guess my question is something like what are the real possibilities for AI to actually do economic planning? Is that an insufficient scope to look at it through? Is that a pipe dream for people on the left who should abandon the project of historical teleology? No, it's not a pipe dream. It's not a pipe dream. It's a very interesting question. I think it's one that's become both less hypothetical and also more complex in the recent years. In the stack, the book that you mentioned, one of the things I talked about this rather specifically in relationship to it, because you put it the irony by which you look at Walmart plan economy, Amazon is a plan economy. Some of this goes back to what was identified in the 50s and 60s by Friedrich Hayek is what he called the socialist pricing problem, which familiar listeners may not be familiar, I'll try to recap it. Is that the argument that was made back then, he's a sort of free market economist, to say the least, the argument is that markets are information processing mechanisms that they produce price and they incorporate signals of demand and supply and they output price. I've been very reductive, but to just to give you a sense of this. The argument he makes is that there's no way in which a central mechanism can sense information. It's sensory order, as he puts it, isn't new onst enough to sense information, calculate information, and then push that information back in the form of price fast enough and with the same degree of flexibility elasticity and markets that inevitably you're going to end up at price distortions, which he calls the socialist pricing problem. You can end up with too many chairs and not enough cushions and too much chalk and not enough chalkboards from the rest of us. Cybersyn comes in, there's a number of people who are already thinking in 1960s, it's like, well, you could solve this if you had enough computational power. And so the irony, which you point to, and I think we talked about the book, is that Amazon and Google produce synthetic price every day. They produce every day. More and more about their suppliers and their suppliers do. And so if you imagine Walmart as a state rather than a corporation or Amazon as a state rather than a corporation, forget that it's private for a moment. Just think of it as an economic information machine. It's constantly producing an artificial price based on the information that it's coming in that it's centrally calculating and pushing back out. And so Lee is exactly right. That planned economies never went away. They just weren't things that states did. They ironically became the things that capitalist corporations did. And so that's the irony of this is that you've got is that on the one hand, yet Amazon has fulfilled the Soviet Goss plan in ways that the Soviets wouldn't have been able to imagine. And that also maybe doesn't wouldn't have made sense to the Chicago School economist that they were the basis of as well. I bring this up just to say that the question of is it possible to use planetary scale computational infrastructural systems to plan and organize and optimize economies in such a way that you're linking a large number of producers and distribute the wealth through distribution platforms and artificial price construction. It's not hypothetical. It's in fact what we it's a fact what we have. But the way I would put a spin on this where I may depart from the cyber sin kind of approach, which suggests that this is the path towards socialism that we're going to end up with is that look, I think we need to understand the irony of the history that you have this mid 20th century dichotomization between free market systems and state socialist systems that were seen as opposites. They developed different theories and practices over a period of time and it turned out through over the last 15 years, we're all kind of living through it that they combined and remade each other in really weird and unlikely in perhaps counterintuitive ways. The conclusion that I draw from that is that the kind of economics that we're likely to see emerge over the next 50 years, let's say, is one that may not be there. It might not be clear whether or not that's socialism or capitalism. It may not be obvious whether or not that's a fulfillment of central planning or decentralization. That may not be the right lens to think it through. The kind of cold war dichotomization may not be very helpful at a certain point, which is, you know, me and I have talked quite a bit about this, but this is where I would sort of put it. We did a project this year in the Antichytheer program, which was about exactly this on updating high x notion of market as an information machine, what it calls Cadillaccy. One of the things that we looked at was the ways in which certain kinds of things that currently are priced that are transacted through a price mechanism may not need to be priced at all. That there are things that you are simply provided as part as a citizenship or some other kind of inclusive arrangement. There may be other kinds of things that aren't priced that need to be priced. One way of thinking about a shift in here is around what the researchers called hypo price and hyper price. Hyper prices when things that aren't priced may become to be priced, let's say carbon and things that are priced that don't get priced, you may think of it. I mean, the simple way of thinking about this is like bundling functions with your subscriptions, right? So it used to be that you want 12 songs, you pay $20 and they give you a silver disc with 12 songs on it, but there was each song was a transaction, right? And like each song had a price, iTunes 99 cents per song, bundling platforms, it's whatever $15, $30, whatever tier you have, and you get all the songs. You're not paying per song and therefore those songs which used to be priced are now unpriced, they're not priced. This is what we call hypo pricing. It's a basic function of what people have been looking at in terms of universal basic income, universal basic services, that things that we used to be priced no longer need to be priced in terms of the provision of those platforms. From my perspective, looking at that lesson of the history, pushing back into the future, instead of trying to see this entirely through the lens of socialism versus capitalism or centralized versus decentralized, I think the more fundamental lens by which to sort of think through and to try to even predict or to compose or to analyze this is again in terms of that technology of price, which kinds of things are, how is price calculated? What is the sensory order that makes that price calculation possible? Because after all, it's technologically, it's based on a particular technological substrate that allows that sense to happen in the first place. Indeed, this shift of pricing to not price and the flip of those, I think that's where the crux of it is at, where the actions at. I really like the project that our researchers did on that, which is called Auto-Catalaxi, by the way. That sounds fantastic. I have to say, I have been asking that question on every podcast for the last three years, and that is the most satisfying answer that there's a convergent evolution between the free market project and the Soviet project where they end up doing the same thing. That sounds really fantastic. They come for you. They come for you Joshua. You just signed your own. I'm actually, I'm re-reading right now the economic calculation in the socialist Commonwealth by Ludwig Man Mises, just seeing what it was so many years ago when it was published. It just feels very surreal right now. Let me just jump in there and add one more thing to your reading list then. Sure, sure. One of our researchers in the program, William Morgan, who's a PhD student at Berkeley has done a lot of work on this. One of the things that we read and were continuing to work on, there was a time in Hayek's work, he ended up going in a lot of different directions, where he was very interested in cybernetics and the implications of cybernetics for economic systems. The book of Hayek's that's most informed by this particular interest in cybernetics is the book The Sensory Order, which is the one that is really looking at. How is it that markets sense information, produce information that they're able to do this calculation and structure? And it's it's thoroughly crisscrossed with with cybernetics thinking. It's really quite interesting in the way in which he goes sort of about this. That was not the direction that he went in. It was a sort of an earlier book, but to add to your list, I think you might find it more interesting and fun these is actually. That sounds like a necessary piece for this next semester.

      "episode": "961 - The Dogs of War feat. Seth Harp (81825).txt",
      "text": "Hello everybody, it's Monday, August 18th, and this is your Trapo. Just gonna jump right into it today. We're very excited to have back on the show author Seth Harp to talk about his newly released book, The Fort Bragg Cartel. Seth, I mean, this is, no shaped any of the other authors or books we've discussed on the show, but this is an astounding piece of work, Seth. And like, I guess like the highest compliment I can pay it is that this is nonfiction that reads like a novel to me. And just like to contextualize this book for our listeners, I was just thinking of two fiction authors throughout this book that I think will like sort of situate the material. And the first of course was James Elroy. I was thinking of Elroy reading this book just because of the sheer scope of just squalor and psychopathic depravity carried out under the guise of law enforcement, or I guess in this case national security. And like the personalities and people that populate this book are truly terrifying. And the other one was Stephen King because like a lot of this book sort of read like a horror story to me. It's like you sort of invoke a demon into your life and society that then steals your soul and turns you into a monster. But there's no supernatural explanation required because like the mechanism here is like just drug addiction and war and killing people. But like think about a book like it where like there's a physical location that is like the locus of evil. Is there like at the heart of this book like what is the thing the it to you that like from which spins out this like you know kaleidoscope of murder, torture, corruption and death. I mean, if you wanted to reify it, you could say that Delta forces base, you know, hidden in the woods. No, for brag is kind of that you know that that monster lurking in the forest. But I think you know more generally it's the entire US special operations complex and the dark heart of the war machines and waging arm conflict all over the planet for the last 25 years. It's what's generating all this darkness and evil. I want to begin with a person who is sort of a tour guide or the main character at least for a lot of the book. Can you tell us what made you choose master sergeant William Levine as sort of a representative of the special forces and like his life and career as kind of a stand in for this like history that we're that you're discussing. So Billy Levine was found murdered on Fort Bragg at the very end of 2020. And I chose him simply because the book is at its heart and investigation into who killed him as well as the guy who the soldier who was found dead next to him Timothy Dumas. But as it turns out William Levine was a great sort of his life and career, the arc of his life and career and his death turned out to be an ideal guide into this underworld because he was such a complex character. There's many things I can highlight about Billy Levine but one of the things that's not often picked up on or immediately picked up on is that you know Levine although he was a Delta Force operator who had done lots of tours. He had turned against the sort of post 9-11 forever war paradigm and had actually come to hold foreign policy beliefs not unlike my own or perhaps that you guys would share. He was very demoralized and disillusioned with his mission. There's a lot more to the story as well but I want to point out just that Levine was not a one-dimensional character actually. I'm glad I like the fact that he was not the sort of like yokes door-kicking knuckle-dragging trouble-a-detic you know, meathead operator of stereotypes. In fact he was rather introverted, rather soft spoken, rather nice guy before all of this and for that reason he made him more of an interesting character from my perspective as an author. He had a very sort of like fall staff like quality in all of this that I really liked. Yes I think that's a good way to put it. Could you give a listen to just like how did Billy Levine start his career in the special forces and what were like some of the campaigns that he took part in and like what would begin his kind of descent into this world of criminality that eventually led to his murder? Levine was a regular guy from the upper peninsula of Michigan, you know, a middle class or working class midwesterner who joined the army actually just before 9-11 in order to get free laser eye surgery. You know a lot of people joined the military for economic reasons and Levine was one of them. Levine crossed side as a kid and picked on as a result of his that slight physical deformity which is actually pretty easily corrected but you know your parents have to be able to afford an ophthalmologist and his couldn't. So that's one of the things that you can get when you join the army is free laser eye surgery. So that's why he joined. He did an early tour in Iraq as a cavalry scout with the striker brigade out of Fort Lewis and then quickly got taken up the pipeline of the first special forces command of the first special forces group at a time when the whole special operations complex was rapidly expanding. He made the cut for Delta Force in 2009 at a time when the unit was rapidly expanding and you know the fact that he was only I believe 26 at that time is indicative of that rapid growth in the unit because normally the guys are a bit older than that. He then went on to do I'm not exactly sure how many tours because the idiosyncratic way out which is enlisted record was printed the copy I obtained doesn't show what he was doing for a couple of key years but by 2012 he was doing back to back rotations in Afghanistan in service of the US assassination program there under the Obama administration when the war became all about drone strikes and night raids. He went on to do tours in Niger and then in Iraq and Syria and the war against ISIS there and in the middle of all that he spent some time in Israel undergoing training with the IDF as to what precipitated his sort of decline to this life of crime that he was leading the time was death. I already mentioned before his disillusionment with the wars and also a big component of the story is something that happened to Billy in 2018 and his drug addiction by the way I skipped right over that but at some point along the way he had been prescribed dexter onphetamine like a lot of operators are to help him cope with sleep deprivation which quickly spiraled out of control to where he became addicted to cocaine and was using a lot of coke and a lot of other drugs and then I don't know if you want to get into this right now but in 2018 he actually shot and killed his best friend and fellow green beret out of the house in Fayetteville and that more than anything else I think really sent him off the deep deep and the guilt and remorse that he felt as a result of having murdered his best friend. Yeah I know that was my next question his friend Sergeant First Class Mark Leshakar could you describe who Mark Leshakar was his relationship to Billy and the circumstances of his murder. So Mark was a regular green beret in the 19th Special Forces group in fact he was a national guardsman who was working at Fort Bragg I believe in an administrative desk job he had done tours in Afghanistan to jica stand the Philippines so he was a green beret but he was significantly less elite than Billy. The two of them were best friends you know one thing that they shared in common was a voracious appetite for drugs both of them were really into using lots of drugs and they went to Disney World with their two young daughters you know they each had a daughter ages 5 and 6 respectively they took the girls to Disney World and were there for several days just drinking and doing drugs the whole time and on the way back to Fayetteville Mark who had ingested bath salts I don't know if it was on purpose or inadvertently because he got you know MDMA or something that was cut with bath salts but he started really tripping and hallucinating and he became convinced that the car was being followed and his paranoia started to irritate Billy and they got into an argument and they were arguing in the car on the whole way home and then when they got home it escalated from there and Billy ended up shooting and killing Mark right in the foyer of foyer's house and then after that you know the really important thing that I've focused on the first two chapters of the book is how the military command dealt with that murder and how they made that case against Billy Levine just go away. Can you talk a little bit about the drug culture you talk about a bit with Delta Forest but also the just Jay's talk in general I thought it was very interesting because it does kind of remind me of I mean I guess they do use steroids too but the use of steroids in professional sports specifically combat sports where it's a you know guys in that context aren't necessarily taking steroids because they want to have like cum gutters it's because the human body is not supposed to be able to fight for 25 minutes and that's the only way you can train to that capacity and similarly like it seems like the only way you could do the job of being in Delta Forest which as you describe as just being a global assassination squad is by you know just basically doing an eight ball every day yeah that's exactly right I mean I don't think the human body you're not meant to be do the things the Delta operators do either I mean it's incredibly hard on your body and mind. Stereoid abuse is a big thing in that community because you know steroids are actually pretty effective in the short term it's being up recovery and helping with injuries so it's easy to see you know these these hierarchies are very competitive all the guys in the green beret groups they all want to go Delta and make selection and only a small number of them are able to make the cut so they use a lot of steroids for that you know the harder drug use comes in I think as well in the same context because you're dealing not only with you know physical pain you know which makes people take things like you know opiate starting off with opiate prescription painkillers and then progressing from there to heroin but also there's a lot of like you know moral injury that's inherent in this job that the guys don't really like to talk about but you know if you have personally killed a hundred or more people like in close quarters combat that's going to do bad things to your psychology unless you're an absolute psychopath which is actually pretty rare in the human population and I've heard that the unit intentionally tries to weed out actual true psychopaths through its battery of like psychological exams so you know if you're or just a relatively normal person then you know going through these experiences is guaranteed to fuck you up mentally and spiritually and people that have had that happen to them and that are in a bad place in that way you know they almost automatically turn to drugs I mean damaged people self-medicate it's what they do is something that a person who's an army epidemiologist told me who has studied this cohort so I think drug use is endemic and the green berets primarily for for those reasons yeah I mean you talk about the yeah the physical toll but yeah you bring up the the moral and spiritual one as well and like reading this book like I was just struck by like how fundamentally unnatural and debominable it is to like a human being to consciously take the life of another person and I thought about that in the context of how the special forces as you describe in this book how they like go from being what we think of in popular culture is like our most elite soldiers who fight our toughest battles to as you said a global nighttime assassination squad where they're not like doing pitch battles with people they are selecting names off a list to target them and just assassinate them like come kick in their door in the middle of night and shoot that like just murder them how does like that that switch in war how are the special forces at the forefront of of that into just like going from like what we think of as war like battles between two sides of people with guns to this like global hit squad well it was a very specific policy choice that was made during the surge in Iraq 2007 and eight in which the emphasis became on night raids rather than the sort of a more conventional more traditional method of ways in war that you're talking about where you have infantry soldiers who are going out on patrol and drawing fire and then fighting back instead they're using intelligence signals intercepts tips from paid informants surveillance feeds to generate targets and then go and hit those targets at night and typically everyone on point dies you know one thing that I follow some of the sort of message boards where you know guys in this community kind of dissect my work and in many cases are very critical one thing that they were pushing back on pretty hard in the initial week after publication was the idea that you know wind Delta hits a target that they just slaughter everybody who's there and it's true that they also do abduction missions where the target is deliberately captured and interrogated for their intelligence value but you know I have a lot of things I guess to say about that critique two things would be that you know one the capture missions well that's not like it's not like a good thing to come and be abducted by Delta Force because God knows what happens to matter that like where do they put these people and what do they do with them after that so even if they do capture them you know are they being put in secret prisons or they being held on ships like that's not like an out to say oh we're actually we're not killing every single person that we target the other thing is that if you look at the comments that are made by former Delta officers and operators in public forums including on podcasts and stuff they themselves will talk about you know I just posted one this morning by a former Delta commander named Jeff Teeks who told Dalton Fisher one of these operator podcasts he said you know when we hit a target we will kill you your family your village your pets your bullfish when the black helicopters come everyone dies and that's like you know that's more exaggerated than anything that's you know that's putting it more vehemently than anything I wrote in my book and that's coming directly from a former Delta Force commander well as long as we're talking about pets one of the most blood curdling things that I've seen got a lot of traction in the coverage of your book is the details about Sergeant Levine's dog could you describe the the details about the titanium dentures and some of the videos that he took sort of in country yeah um so Levine was a dog handler and dogs are a big part of what Delta does they use dogs for a lot of things including as attack animals they send them in an advance of a raid and they they attack people they're trained to do that and so Billy had a dog that he had adopted that had been one of the units former working animals a dog named Rocky that had titanium dentures because they put titanium dentures in some of these dogs teeth and but all of this dogs this retired dogs teeth had all been removed and Levine told a source of mine a woman named Nicole Rick who is Mark Leschik her sister you know she asked him why the dog had no teeth and he explained to her that the dog had been trained to attack and that they had removed them to prevent him from posing a danger to people and then he related this anecdote in which you know he had allowed the dog to eat the brains of someone who had been killed in one of these raids she was obviously incredibly grossed out by this by the way that's not the she wasn't the only person who told me about gruesome stories relating to Billy's dog another of his former buddies from the army told me that he had that Levine had shown him videos of his dog attacking people including a video of him ripping someone's fingers off so it was in in the process of writing this book was difficult because these these are very secretive unit and these guys don't talk to the media so I had to make judgment calls about what type of you know allegations to include or what type to credit and in some cases there's things that can't be corroborated or there can't there can't be proven directly but can be corroborated we have multiple people telling you the same thing so that's why we chose to publish this detail even though what it's not crucial to the book at all it's kind of a you know just something that's thrown in for for a bit of illustration or for color in any event that was something else that many people on the on the SF vet bro forums picked up on to say this is can't be true that this shows that that I'm inventing stuff and I'm publishing hearsay from unreliable women however no sooner did those guys pile on with all those type of comments than somebody who is on the same board actually posted a video shot from a drone that clearly shows animal adult to force or another special operations working dog just savagely attacking a dead body doing basically what had been described in the book so it was just amazing to see that video come out and prove for a fact the kind of stuff that I'm alleging is real I'd take like a broader view uh each like these are the individuals involved in the special forces but can you talk to us about the founding of the delta forces and then JSOC and like the the shift like what what compelled uh the the government and the military to go from like delta force to founding of the JSOC and then why you you write that this is the most significant event in US military history since the emergence of a permanent standing army following world war too could you expand on that sure so delta force was um was uh created in the in the late 1970s and its first operation operation eagle claw in Iran was famously a disaster they were there to rescue the hostages that have been taken prisoner by Iranian revolutionaries in the American embassy and uh there was a helicopter crash at the staging ground that killed like a crewman and the whole thing uh was a debacle and led to Carter's uh failure to be reelected JSOC is a sort of larger superstructure that was built up around delta force in order to give delta force assets like you know aircraft naval capacities basically everything that it needed to be a free standing unit because the problem in operation eagle claw was that delta was using borrowed assets and the task force that they used was kind of ad hoc and patched together at the last minute so uh uh going forward they created JSOC um to build it out and create like a full spectrum counterterrorism forces what it was originally specifically for things like hostage rescue another very difficult tactically complex military missions now pretty soon became more involved in things like covert actions uh and as far back as the 1980s in places like Nicaragua elsewhere in Latin America but it remained for the first 20 years of its existence a pretty niche organization and it wasn't really until the post-9-11 wars that it grew massively and its uh size its number of personnel its funding its mission set everything just grew and grew until it became you know the single most important uh component of the military um the you know the most prestigious the most selected the most elite hardest to get into with the most direct line to the president uh and other top top US officials and um the primary method of of waging war these days is through jsocla task forces in various countries where the US is waging you know these off the books shadow wars and proxy wars and that's why i say it's the most important um events since the creation of a permanent standing army because the creation of jsoc inaugurated this entirely new paradigm for um waging war and i think like that that sort of grows out of the experience of the American military and government in the Iraq war because like the creation of jsocla it it fills this need that was created by the fact that the Iraq war was a disaster and everyone hated it and they knew too much about it and like even in the sanitized version that they saw on the news was too much for them so jsocla we provided first bush and then obama like a great way to continue all of these operations but have them carried out under literally undercover of the night and just like less American soldiers dying that we're aware of but like it created like you said this like this whole new way of fighting a war like it's based on these assassination campaigns directed at the Iraqi insurgency because you talk about that yeah that's exactly right i mean you said it you nailed it i can add to that that it was from the perspective of like that from the lens of like the u.s domestic politics it was a successful move because of the american populist by and large doesn't really care that much about foreign policy and we'll be pretty checked out unless American soldiers are coming back in body bags unless there are like these large scale you know wars invasions like we saw in Iraq which proved to be incredibly unpopular by doing it through jsocla they're able to continue the same missions but without that domestic political cost and like that does this lead to the rise of like american soldiers who are killed conducting training missions in tejika stand or something like that killed in an accident or a car accident like this way of covering up actual combat deaths in these off the books like wet work missions that's an interesting question you know i think that um i don't think casualty reports are faked i i get a lot of them through foya and i believe that when a jsoc operator is killed in action overseas that you will have a publicly available document that reflects that death now there have been so many accidents suicides and drug overdoses at Fort Bragg that some people including in a lot of situations where they've redacted the circumstances of death when i post that kind of thing it leads a lot of people to speculate hey these are casualties that are actually taking place in off the books wars i don't know that we can say that or i don't think that we can say that i don't uh believe that that's the case a lot you know jsoc operators don't typically get themselves killed they're very good at what they do they have a lot of ways to mitigate the risks when they're doing things like assassination operations in iraq insiri which they're doing right now in 2025 on a near daily basis in iraq insiri and yet you know they don't take casualties by and large that's part of the um you know what we're talking about the paradigm for continued the continuation of the wars without the casualties a big part of that is that these guys there are tactically able to to go in you know kill people and get out without themselves suffering casualties i thought um another very interesting point you made something we've talked about on the show is this idea of you know you talk about delta force edits and section it was originally um at least the goals of uh back with and some some of his you know sponsors it within the army was to create a an army unit that specifically was modeled after the s a s like they you know they already had multiple special forces units but a to have a unit that specifically could do counter terrorism ops and could you do something like retake an embassy that you know fifth special forces or something like that couldn't necessarily do you identify it sort of around the warrant error that eventually jaysock it kind of replaced the cia in their traditional role is like the tip of the spear of the american empire and sort of the the main factor in all covert operations this is kind of a general question but do you think that you can attribute like the this sort of culture of lawlessness and like murders and drug abuse and everything do you think that that can be attributed broadly to just their their covert role expanding like that since the warrant error i mean certainly the fact that their operations are so protected by secrecy and the unit itself is so um shielded by government secrecy that it creates an environment which all kinds of bad behavior flourishes and also the sort of cultural adulation that's heaped upon these guys where they're treated as super almost like real life superheroes i think that contributes to the sort of like rock star partying you know atmosphere and i should say look i'm not like a drug i'm not here to judge anybody who makes the choice to use drugs i'm more of a civil libertarian in that respect i don't think drugs should even be illegal i'd completely oppose the entire drug war but of course we're dealing with a separate subset of the population here which is you know elite government agents who are you know military operatives who among there many other tasks that are deeply involved in prosecuting the sort of militarized drug war in Latin America so they're a fair game i think for this type of criticism because you know they're supposed to be the you know warriors on the side of law and order but in their own communities it doesn't they don't look like that at all right i don't think that makes you a prohibitionist to say that i don't think you should you know shove 30 percussed up your asshole before jumping out of an airplane and killing someone's family i'm pretty civil libertarian too but i'm you know tell me in yeah uh well i mean i said like so much of this book is the story of the special forces in the 21st century or and before that as well is really the story of drugs and two in particular heroin and cocaine and that let's beginning with heroin because you talk about how the opium market in 1990s Afghanistan led to the rise of the Taliban as sort of a tough on crime reaction to the muhajidine yeah the CIA war that was waged in Afghanistan in the 1980s is very famous as the sort of Charlie Wilson's war kind of like this uh it's regarded i think as a very successful example of co-reaction which the Russians were driven out but uh then the story ends you know in the 1990s are that the story is not told to us so the continuation of it we don't see which was that those very same wujahidine that had been formerly backed by the CIA took over Afghanistan and they were the ones who originally turned the country into a narco state the Taliban emerged in the mid 90s specifically in reaction to these warlords and their abuses and among the things that they did like you know i'm not here to defend the Taliban or promote or praise them because we hear so much about you know their treatment of women their oppression of women which is very real and other abuses but that uh often what we don't understand about the Taliban and the source of their popularity is that they suppressed crime in Afghanistan not just drug trafficking i mean crime most often done by like the law enforcement like you know cops and military in Afghanistan yes and it wasn't just drug trafficking is also kidnapping and child sex trafficking but they eliminated all of the drugs uh drug production that was taking place in Afghanistan in fact in the summer of 2001 is when they complete that eradication campaign campaign you know a few months later in November October the US invaded Afghanistan and teamed up with those exact same narco warlords and they um created uh the Afghan client state that the US backed for 20 years in Afghanistan and it's like and this gets i think one of the most galling and one of the most really like just jaw dropping parts of the book is like at 9-11 happens the US military invades Afghanistan and occupies it for 20 years and over that exact same period of time domestically in the United States you see an explosion of opiate addiction i mean like this is you know obviously prescription drugs are in part of that but like as prescription drugs got too expensive to buy illegally suddenly the US market was flooded with tons of cheap heroin from asia because you talk about how the DEA reacted to like this explosion of heroin in the United States and who they tried to and the way they they kept the sourcing of this heroin sort of vague initially the DEA was accurately tracking the influx of afghan heroin to the United States the DEA national drug threat assessment for 2002 specifically says that as a result of the Taliban's fall that heroin production ramped up again in Afghanistan and then for the next few years was reporting on the high level of heroin availability from south asia or from asia especially in the northeast of the United States in in appalachia and in the midwest which are the markets that that afghan heroin reaches first because it comes by air whereas mexican heroin comes over the border and supplies california southwest however around 2008 the DEA completely changed its story and began publishing every year an assertion that only one percent of the heroin in the United States comes from afghanistan and that is a very counterintuitive proposition because at the time by 2008 afghan understands the world's largest supplier of drugs the us is the world's largest consumer of drugs and the us controls afghanistan so to say that there's no drugs flowing from one to the other defies for duality and in looking deeply into this and and how the DEA came to that determination I found that they use these two tracing programs and got into in the book I get into the weeds I won't now but suffice it to say that when you look carefully at how they make that determination it's riddled with untenable assumptions and in fact the DEA in fine print admits that they don't know where fully 60% of the heroin in the United States comes from they they just speculate that it comes from mexico it's actually called alleged mexican white is the made up nomenclature for this category of heroin but in 2012 some researchers they were working for the office of national drug control policy were analyzing the DEA's work in this regard and published a paper that used mathematical methods to show that the estimates of heroin availability by geographic origin were irreconcilable with other known metrics of heroin availability basically saying these numbers are bogus these numbers don't add up and ever since then the DEA has said nothing and its annual drug threat assessments about Afghanistan despite it being the world's largest narco state they focus on mexico and colombia and other countries and any mention of Afghanistan was simply scrubbed from their publications altogether I guess this brings us to faithville north carolina where for pratt is located given the the picture of the availability of high grade heroin in america in the years following 9-11 and the ensuing war on terror to what extent can it be said that like this was just coming into america on military cargo plans landing at military bases and then being directly distributed by us soldiers it seems clear that some of that was taking place and there are other cases incidentally of that same thing happening between colombia and the united states there was a case in 2005 five soldiers in colombia who are trafficking multimillion dollar quantities of coke into into the united states from colombia on military planes and then recently in 20 as recently as 2018 there was a case of a couple green berets who are also trafficking million dollar quantities of coke from colombia to duke airfield in florida which is special operations airfield in florida now there's no comparable cases that have been adjudicated in the criminal justice system of the same thing happening between united states and afghanistan but people who read my book i think well they will see in careful detail how in case after case the authorities both military and civilian are quite capable of covering up cases that promise to be put it looked to be politically embarrassing and just making those those disappear so it's not outside the realm of possibility that this happened and was simply covered up or dealt with unofficially and you know a crucial narrative sort of vehicle in the book is that one of the guys who was found or the guy who was found murdered next to the lily the v in temethy doomas had actually written after being kicked out of the army for drug use in 2016 he sat down and wrote a blackmail letter in which he reported to name the members of a special drug ring and the special forces who are doing just this you know doomas it served four tours attached to j sakin afghanistan and he knew about what was going on at the kandahar airfield and wrote a letter describing you know just what we're saying and drug trafficking ring however he was murdered before that before that letter ever came to light and just thinking about like fadil north carolina and fort brag how would you describe the community like the military community in fadville and like fort brag specifically it's a very unusual community because you know fort brag is 50,000 soldiers mostly young men all infantry or special forces and so imagine you know who are mostly white in fadil is a majority black city that surrounds fadil there's a complex dynamic they it's been a military town since its inception there was actually a great book written in 2001 called homefront by anthropology professor and cathartin lutz who delves into just this topic from an anthropological perspective and chronicles you know the high rates of poverty inequality homelessness gender violence and among many other things drug trafficking you know which she and the sources that she interviewed blamed on soldiers who bring narco trafficking knowledge in context back with them from tours in aja and latin america now she wrote that in 2001 and in the course of my research and reporting i found that that those type of activities have dramatically expanded as a result of the of the so-called global war on terrorism i mean you also write about after 9-11 like a spate of murders of basically wives and girlfriends being killed and a lot of the sources in this book are you know the former wives and girlfriends of a lot of these guys like how would you describe like their role in like the situation of like the women in these peoples lives who are often like the most exposed to the i don't know like the the psychological toll and violence that these guys lives have taken on them they're fully immersed in this world and they experience it indirectly you know they their husbands or their boyfriends are they're off on deployment often a lot of the year they're back at home they're dealing with a lot of the sort of heartbreak and fidelity substance abuse all these things that characterize life and the special forces you know impact them domestically now when i came around to to writing my book in a lot of cases i found you know this i said before this is a difficult target journalistically delta forces very secretive institution and the guys are trained not to ever talk to the media now there were quite a few operators that spoke to me some on the record mostly not on the record mostly completely off the record however the most valuable sources the most knowledgeable and the most willing to talk tended to be moms sisters ex-girlfriends ex-wives who had seen their husband you know brother son what have you come to a bad end on for brag and for that reason didn't care all about respecting this culture of silence and in fact were um you know rearing to talk about it because they were in a lot of cases really pissed off um and um because of their knowledge of this inside world because they're motivated to talk in many cases they were they were my best sources you talk a little bit about like uh the training for special forces what can you tell us about like how the military selects people through this process and what make like what in the training differs from like uh standard or even other elite units in the u.s military or marines well selection for delta forces very difficult to get into and i think the primary selection tool they use to weed people out is by just incredibly brutal ruck marches you know marching 40 miles with a pack that weighs i don't know maybe 50 pounds over 100 degree heat like yeah yeah sometimes in in he or in cold or in uh or in adverse uh inclement weather and that's just something that not a lot of people are capable of doing you have to be very very tough not only deft to be in really good shape but you just have to be really tough and be able to suck up a lot of pain to be able to withstand that so that's a that's a big part of their selection their training is very specialized they go through um lots of specialized courses you know they're already special forces soldiers so they're already they're already highly trained uh but on top of what they've already done you know high altitude low-opening parachute jumps are a big part of delta training halo operations um they drill constantly on marksmanship but you know i've read that the delta force uses more ammo per year than the entire marine core uh on their on their shooting ranges guys like billi livin looking at their enlistment records they often have training i often have been to esoteric courses like you know evasive driving or counter surveillance these guys are um not just soldiers they're just as much in many cases they're just as much spies as they are soldiers and their training reflects that well yeah i mean like another fascinating part of the book is when you talk about how uh jay sock soldiers are allowed to operate and basically virtually the entire globe and are given fake covers including like basically real passports and fake like a son with essentially fake passports and social security numbers that are essentially real by the dmv and the state department and they basically are allowed to go to any country in the world and pose as tourists aid workers um just like the the kind of thing you're really not supposed to do in the military they like you know be out of uniform uh because you talk about like like that level of reach and like the and the practice of posing as civilians in foreign countries i literally didn't know that was a thing before i started writing this book i didn't know that active due to us troops can be in a foreign country either in a small group in pairs or solo posing as civilians while in fact carrying out uh abduction mission assassination or maybe espionage you know bugging embassies and that kind of thing but as it turns out that's a big part of what Delta Force does now guys like billi-le-ving probably didn't do that type of work you know he probably didn't wear i know he didn't wear uniform i've seen pictures of him down range um but at the same time he's not disguised as you know like an NGO worker they're just wearing whatever because they're not on film there's they never have any journalists come around they're going out and doing night raids so they're allowed to just wear whatever they want but there are compartmented elements of Delta Force in particular an element called g squadron uh which ver is very much dedicated to exactly those type of operations uh and in fact i had a tip come in this morning about how they deploy to simolia according to this tips are you know i haven't verified it but it's consistent with what i've learned you know they were deploying to simolia or first to etiopia uh disguised as humanitarian workers were there to do flood relief i mean this would seem to uh in peril actual us civilians who are aid workers or torus in foreign countries if people posing as them are abducting and killing people in those countries yeah absolutely i mean it's uh you know it's outrageous that they're doing this that the government is letting them do this i mean that's just the beginning of the criticisms that that i would have of this practice you know that the fact that real humanitarian workers are are now going to be under the shadow of suspicion as a result of these activities well and then the other i thought uh very telling detail in in this part of the book is there was one country that was exempted from this sort of penetration by special forces posing as civilians and it was Israel could you talk about that yeah that was a detail that um you know i made no attempt to elicit it was just a uh unit employee talking to me about her training and all the countries in which the unit operates and she just spontaneously volunteered and this is by the way it was before October 7th before Israel and Palestine were so much in the news you know she just told me yeah you know they just mentioned that we could never do spy in operations in Israel and that um when Delta operators go to Israel because they're there routinely the fact that Levine was there is instructive because you know he was very much a mid-level or a low-level guy enlisted not an officer and yet the fact that he uh was spending you know on his enlistment records shows four months in Israel that shows me that pretty much all unit guys rotate through Israel and apparently when they're staying there the the idea puts them up in bug hotel rooms they're aware that they're bugged they're not allowed to choose their accommodations and they submit to this indignity which they wouldn't i don't think except from any other ally country and yeah that's just pathetic english i mean well at least like you know at least through the Israel we can say that they never spy on us at least there's like a reciprocal thing there well i mean i was just struck by it by like because like these guys go to Israel to receive training and so like you know our best friend and clients they would seem to know the most about these guys and i think it's telling that they don't let them in the country except unless unless under heavy surveillance yeah yeah i've heard that um you know i don't know what they're doing whether it's training or what i'm not sure exactly why delta force operators go to Israel as a good day regor apart you know of their advancement through the ranks uh it could be training it could be intelligent sharing i believe the israel probably generates a lot of the targets the delta force is hitting every every week or every day possibly right now in iraq and in syria because israel has so many enemies there um and the us intelligence particularly our language capabilities are so poor that i imagine it's israel generating most of the targets for them and you know trump earlier this year a few months into his administration made a comment where he said since my inauguration uh us forces in in iraq syria and samalia have eliminated 68 terrorists and to me that was a clear reference so what's called the expeditionary targeting force which is a delta force troop that has been stationed in iraq in syria for 10 years now and trump the fact that trump gave a number uh was very you know Biden never talked about these operations and neither did his people but this trump's comment provided a crucial window because that was a approximation of the tempo of operations that they're doing 68 he said and i guess that had been two or three months at 68 kills i mean so you can do the math very easily and again to bring it back to the point i'm making like it's 2025 who are those people that they're attacking and killing in iraq in syria they'll all the sent common they put out statements they'll just say that they're ISIS but i think that's probably really reductive a lot of them are most likely um iranian or alay with the iranians are who knows but i think it's probably israel mostly this directing those those operations well we talked earlier about like the assassination campaign that was in the one under in the iraq war that was sort of part of the surge and this sort of a smaller footprint you know less high profile uh you know more highly targeted shall we say military operations but like you make the point that like every Sunni militant in iraq was just like put under the umbrella term of al-Qaeda in iraq right like that they're a part of an international global terrorism network that would be otherwise attacking america but throughout the book you also make reference to what you refer to as the third iraq war or the iraq war part three because you tell us what you what you're describing uh referring to when you make that reference so president obama drew down troops from iraq and um completed in almost uh an almost complete withdrawal by 2011 however after isis emerged you know in 2014 obama redeployed troops to iraq in Syria uh he redeployed troops to iraq and also to Syria uh for the first time putting you know uniform soldiers on the ground in Syria and throughout the rest of his presidency jesok led task force over there was waging you know a major ground campaign against isis it was um a war that was easily on the scale of the iraq war itself what i call a rock war two and last to the present day just the operations i was just talking about our continuation of this campaign which i think culminated around 27 or culminated in 2017 with the destruction of the city of raka but that was sort of jesok's biggest war to date and yeah as i keep saying um it continues to the stay another another small but uh sort of telling detail in this book for me that what i found very surprising is you talk about how the u.s military as far as institutions go in american life is very diverse however you state that infantry soldiers are mostly white and that special forces soldiers are almost all white what are we to make of that detail i i was very surprised by that you know that's obviously not the focus of my book i mean should the the race of the guys that are carrying out these war crimes is really not the most important um aspect of it never the less this is this is something that many of my sources told me about um that is a very salient feature of the green berets and in particular delta force is that um you know we were talking about selection earlier but selection is very idiosyncratic and it's very much an old boys club and they choose guys who look like them and it's mostly guys who look the same look the part they tend to be not not only just white guys but but uh tall white guys they really tend to select for guys who are quite tall you see that all the photos of them uh people i've been under six feet being discriminated against once again i hate it i i think you could find some of that you know um that uh discrimination against the vertically challenged and and delta force for sure i mean billy levine was six foot one and um mark lesschikr if i'm not mistaken was six foot six uh so so these tend to be halking dudes but yeah i interviewed i interviewed soldiers you know uh african american soldiers in that eighty second who tried out for for for the third group or for special forces or for delta who talked about just this and how it's almost impossible as a as a black i'd eat in delta force now the sf that bro message words will jump on this and even post pictures of the one black operator who was folk who was photographed in syria a few years ago and say you but again okay you're talking about 99 percent white but delta is three hundred four hundred operators so yes there are one two three and of course there's a high degree of turn over so i'm not saying it never happens there's also probably are there definitely have been asian operators latino operators but it is it is the kind of the degree of whiteness it would not be tolerated in the other um institution of such importance to the us government because everyone would see just by looking at it that it's so homogenous i mentioned before that your your book is what is larger the story of drugs in the twenty-first century and we talked a little bit about the uh afghanistan and it's parallel in production but i'd like to turn down to uh cocaine because i and like could you talk about uh the character in your book who uh was the some former special forces guy who became a state trooper and then became a major cocaine trafficker yeah so uh freddy wane hawk he actually was never in the military um but i still felt that his trajectory uh closely paralleled some of these other guys and then of course he was working with them so uh freddy hawk was a north carolina state trooper who was very good at asset forfeiture so good in fact that people whispered that he must have an inside line with the cartels because he was so good at at uh picking out which motor is going by we're carrying six figure sums of cash you know destined for mexico and he so he became a d a task force agent and he was going around the country lecturing other police departments explaining how to do asset forfeiture and stuff he was a really dedicated hard charging young canine officer but he got fired from the from the highway patrol after he gave a dwi ticket to a donor to the a governor of north carolina so this left him extremely embittered uh and unemployed and at that point he decided that he was going to use uh you know his detailed knowledge of how drug traffickers move narcotics to become a drug trafficker in his own right and he was able to leverage the connections and knowledge that he had to to create uh a de forgin alliance with the los zetas cartel in mexico and he began trafficking hundreds of kilos of cocaine up from mexico to north carolina um using these specialized techniques for smuggling and for um defeating drugs nipping dogs i i love that detail of the book Seth uh basically telling me it's telling telling all i readers if you're looking to import cocaine into the country there's a very detailed description of how you can bypass drugs nipping dogs and and some very sophisticated smuggling techniques employed by these guys but uh set you mentioned uh los zetas uh because you could you talk about uh they're both the US end Israeli training like we have where these guys came from and just like how they became one of the most brutal cartels in the world and their relationship to this whole story that you're telling here yeah the fact that huff was working with los zetas uh proved to be ironic or brought things full circle because los zetas started off as an elite mexican military unit that had been trained you know the green berets their whole thing is liaisons with foreign allies where they train foreign troops and stand up foreign um military formations often in their own mold and so the uh groupo edelmovil de fuerza s especialis its gaffey for its initials in spanish was an elite unit of the mexican army trained at fort bragg and also at fort binning and also as you say they had Israeli trainers and in the year 2000 or so they defected from the mexican state uh eventually struck out on their own and became by far the most feared cartel in mexico and that was one of the most disastrous events in mexican history one of several important factors that precipitated the drug war in mexico the homicide crisis in mexico that's been the darkest epoch in mexico history started with the emergence of los zetas which was shocking to most mexicans because they were so violent um they just outdid all of their predecessors and hyperviolence and terrorism and los zetas today exists in a very fragmented form uh has been um contained to one small part of mexico for for years now other cartels and other paramilitary cartels in the same mold have emerged to to supplant them uh but they do still exist on the mexico border where Freddie Huff was working you know he told me the name of the guy that he was working with he was a brother of uh megal unheld tervenial maralos who was important drug mexican drug lord so that's where the supply of cocaine was coming into north carolina and then Huff was distributing it to temetitumas and billy lavene others are their confederates in the same fort brag cartel this is where the name for the book comes from Freddie Huff was one of many sources who told me there's a cartel in fort brag but Huff was the only one who actually knew the guys personally and had worked with them trafficking drugs another uh maddening thread that emerges in this book is concerns FBI informants and the extensive legal protections and immunity they get and then just like broadly speaking the FBI's role in shutting down investigations into the fort brag fort brag cartel and like could you talk about like the the sort of legal immunity that is enjoyed uh and like the cover-ups that are going on here i mean you do talk there's like a really a harrowing uh rape case that you just talk about that is also covered up because you just talk about how the FBI's role in this and like there's also speculation that uh billy lavene was himself an FBI informant among his compatriots because you talk about how like the FBI has factored into this and their role in i don't know covering up a lot of this really uh just jaw-dropping crime so i was never able to get any documents about billy lavene from the FBI they denied all my foyer requests so i can't say whether or not he was an informant they didn't even answer that question when i posted to them uh in an email but the very fact that that uh lavene was believed to be an FBI informant by his associates in the drug trafficking industry was independently a fact that i um deemed to be worth reporting huff was one of the people who told me that he believed that lavene wasn't FBI agent and he said that so did duimus and that duimus planned to kill lavene because he believed he was an FBI informant now one other detail that linse credulity to the possibility that lavene may have been an FBI informant is the fact that he was arrested six times on felony charges and in none of those cases was he prosecuted or convicted and as we know that can be a benefit of being an FBI informant is prosecutors will drop charges against you for crimes so uh that's an open question about lavene but it seems to have definitely you know influenced the behavior of the people that he was in the drug trade with now as far as cover-ups more broadly you know that's a topic that spans the the entire book from the first page to the to the last page you know i show again and again how there's cases of special operators who turn up in handcuffs accused of serious crimes and then the district attorney just does nothing or like you know they uh you you mentioned like judges will just basically if they show up in their you know dress uniform they just say thank you for your service and send them on their web yeah that was a quote from a you know a police officer who had arrested some guy for something and saw that take place you know soldiers who have shot to court appearances in their class a uniforms um and get special treatment one of the most gut-wrenching and and harrowing uh stories that you relate in the book uh it it construes the story of uh a guy named Keith Lewis and uh it was basically his like his use of steroids but then like really i i don't even know where to go with this but like just his uh murder of his pregnant wife while holding his infant daughter was just so just so horrifying come in yeah one of the most just gutting passages of the book is the you know Keith Lewis murder suicide you know two years before that happened Keith Lewis had gotten in a fight with his uh his uh his wife you know Keith Lewis served in the same unit as bober doll and he was one of these guys who like you know just hated bober doll and so someone said if people who don't know bober doll was the the soldier who walked off of an afghanist a base in afghanistan was captured by the Taliban held prisoner for like five years anyway some stranger made a comment about bober doll that was basically positive Keith Lewis got into a fight with him got into a fight with his wife the police were called he got an arm standoff with the police in which he pointed a gun at the police and he was completely uh let off the hook for that he was not prosecuted in any way for that he was life just just went on and that's a great example of what we're talking about you know in regards to impunity because he was a special a medic in the special forces and then you know just a short time later it went on to kill his wife and her um unborn child she's nine months pregnant and then kill her or himself and yeah he was holding um his child and his arms the entire time you're shooting his wife just one of those shocking things and you know he was dealing steroids on Fort Bragg according to you know multiple credible allegations including large amounts of steroids that were found in his apartment after his death and you know the the last thing he told you the stare his own steroid use which his mom talked to me about uh at length really precipitated severe anger issues that he had and um that can be a consequence of taking synthetic testosterone and other steroids is that it lowers the threshold of aggressive behavior and men it increases propensity to anger especially when mixed with alcohol and so I think that that is part of the um sort of toxic stew that sort of brewing in Fort Bragg is the rampant steroid abuse contributing you know to to this sort of this sort of violence and criminality yeah steroids um there there are effect on people's personality and behavior um a lot of it is kind of murky um the just the anecdotal evidence uh or the thing that bodybuilders and MMA fighters say the most often is they will just make you more like yourself so if you're already an aggressive guy um you know you may show symptoms of road rage it goes without saying that if you uh if you weren't part of an international hit squad you may start killing people in your off time especially if you're not going to an endocrinologist and you're just you know injecting yourself with like 10 times what you should be taking that sounds right um the photographs of the drugs the the steroids that were found in Lewis's apartment included you probably sounds like you know more about this uh Felix and I do but tremble on acetate I think was one of them can't remember the names the other ones off the tub in my head tremble on is a it's a classic body building one I mean I honestly don't know I mean I guess I you know I I guess even members of Delta can just you don't want their triceps to pop but I if I was taking if I was doing gear for like purely utilitarian reasons I would just take test and like maybe depending on my age like some type of like uh estrogen blocker I don't I don't take gear um not because I'm against it it's just I'm the type I I'm the type of person who would like forget I would and I would I would like reuse a needle and give myself a terrible disease well the uh so com's directorate of science and technology occasionally floats the possibility of introducing steroids as a legal regimen for increasing you know the efficiency of of units like Delta Force and Delta operators I don't uh know if those will ever actually get off the ground but it's something that they that they do seriously consider they give operators other drugs they give them dextra on fetamine ambient tram at all benzodiazepines these are routinely prescribed special operators to deal with the the stresses of their of their jobs and so it's not that far-fetched to imagine that they might give them stars as well in the meantime I would say sort of implicit an atmosphere of implicit tolerance for veils you know it's big boy rules uh which means go ahead and do it just don't get caught yeah I just I don't know what reason there would be to not give them uh steroids I mean they like antiblog steroids aren't some ways kind of a miracle drug and how uh quickly they can help people recover from very serious injuries I mean it's just it's as you said these guys are loaded to the gills with dexies I mean is there like a commissioner of assassination that would that would prescribe them if they if they like pissed hot it's not gonna the operator hall of fame yeah it just doesn't make sense to me that they would that they wouldn't outright prescribe it I mean if you have like a halfway decent enter chronologist giving them testosterone and like whatever else they need that's way better than these guys just you know I always think about the black water steroid parties where these guys were were just you know jamming tremolo needles into their each other's asses I uh we'll try not to think about that um the closest thing to is to a commissioner of assassinations that exists is a position in the Pentagon that hardly gets any attention even though it's more important than the secretary the army secretary the navy would have you which is the assistant secretary of defense for uh low intensity for special operations and low intensity conflict it's really a mouthful of acronyms even uglier um but that person is effectively civilian who um sits at the apex of of so calm and um you know Michael vickers is someone I talk about in the book who held this position during some of the key years that that I discuss but that position is somebody who has a great deal of power in the US government and almost never almost nobody ever pays attention to who that who that person is speaking of uh the the commissioner and like the people at the the the sort of the apex of this pyramid I mean the the book mostly spends time with like you look the the actual operators themselves but uh I I did want to ask you about Stanley McChrystal the guy who was sort of the the the the jay sock guru he's a guy who sort of started this and and you know sort of captain uh this whole era what what do you make of general Stanley McChrystal like as a character and not just him but then his successor William Mc raven McChrystal is so much more interesting than Mc raven Mc raven's kind of an enigma you know the books that he's written in the memoirs and how he writes like children's book and stuff he's doing a book reading at uh my local bookstore in Austin you know where he's exhorting young men to make their bed or whatever what what is his children's book I'm say everyone has a fucking children's book now like carriage Patel wrote it's such a scam like I'm so sick of this I'm pretty sure Mc raven's book is called make your bed uh there's already a guy who did that it didn't end very well for him someone fact check me on that please I might have that wrong um but it's that sort of book that that Mc raven is profiting from the sale of sorry it is um in fact make your bed with skipper the seal where a cartoon seal tells you how to become a good seal I presumably like the navy suit I know I like that they're in full listing seals in the so the I mean the the the pinnipet variety not the navy a seal would have nothing to do with that this is this is a guy who has presided over just assassination programs in countless countries for a year who's got whose um whose operators have been criticized for shooting people in their beds among other things for shooting people in their sleep is one thing that um you know a specific criticism that's been levied at JSOC is for the rules of engagement is that they'll come into they'll come into a target in the dead of the night you know wearing soft shoes with silenced weapons catch people asleep and then just kill them right there in their beds which is you know that may not be a violation of JSOC's classified rules of engagement but most people I think find that to be a repugnant violation of the sort of inherent laws before but yeah so mccrvisal talking about make your bed that just gives me horrible visions of like blood stained mattresses from incredibly dark and evil stuff that the troops under his command carried out for so many years like if king vahn wrote a children's book about like how to be a good friend yeah but mccrvisal is a much more interesting guy whose book I think is worth reading he wrote a book called my share of the task which I never would have put myself through the experience of reading had I not been researching the book and I was very surprised you know what a relatively articulate and thoughtful person he is because he more than any other figure was responsible for the rise of delta and jsoc in the iraq war but you know one of the things that he he also expresses contrition about a lot of how things went down something that mccrvisal never does and one of those things you know to bring it back to what you're saying will was how they classified you know pretty much anyone without understanding the real nature of the iraq insurgency they just put everyone in this on this box of saying that if they were Sunni they called them al-Qaeda and they you know we were told that al-Qaeda was metastasizing that was forming cells in iraq and Syria and all over North Africa and all these other countries but to a large degree that's all fictitious or conjectural and mccrvisal basically it admits that we're turning again to the extreme at the beginning of this story with Billy Levine and the other gentleman named Dumas who he ended up dead with in the woods of North Carolina Dumas you you talked to his son who was very explicit in that he believes that his father was murdered for his attempt to blackmail the special forces you talk about like that blackmail dossier that he compiled and this thumb drive that you referenced in the book that is sort of like mama guffin throughout throughout this story yeah Dumas as I mentioned before I mean kicked out of the army for his you know for his whole career I read his separation packet which is a hundred and something pages and which makes clear that his entire career he was stealing from the military stealing weapons stealing prescription drugs possibly stealing cash and he was kicked out in 2016 and in order to exert leverage on the special forces to get his pension reinstated because he was kicked out after like 19 years and some months in service so just shive his 20-year mark and if you serve 20 years you can retire with a lifelong pension so that was important to him and he was denied it and in order to get it back he wrote this letter in which as I said before you know he literally named a bunch of green berets who were trafficking heroin from Afghanistan into the US and military planes I had three different sources no four excuse me tell me about this blackmail letter none of these sources were in contact with one another one of them was a army cid police agent the other was Dumas's son one was Dumas's like girlfriend or mistress and then the fourth one was Freddie Wayne Huff who said that he read the letter and his entire in its entirety and was able to describe it in some detail now I try to get my hands on a copy of that letter it was ultimately unsuccessful the only copy that I managed to track down was on a thumb drive that had been seized from Freddie Huff's house after he was finally arrested and taken down and after you know more than a year of trying to get that thumb drive released the Winston Salem police department didn't release it but they they told me that they would open it up and look at it for me basically to tell them what was on there and but then they just said oh it's empty there's nothing on there everything's been erased so that's interesting but another thing is that Billy Levine had also written you know a cook an incriminating text or something that could have gotten him in trouble in the same way he had been going around telling people that he was writing a book about his time in service and his ex-wife told me this and that someone was trying to make it into a movie and this of course goes completely counter to the unit's culture of silence now the reason why I bring this up is because I just got a tip yesterday from somebody who went to rehab with Billy in Banderra Texas who confirmed that Billy was working on this book and in fact he has this this friend from rehab has a copy of it haven't had the chance to read it although he sent it to me but he said that Billy in this book was writing that about doing cocaine with top officers and that and other things you know exposing other elements that the unit didn't want exposed and he said according to this tipster so calm sent people on three occasions down to the rehab center to talk to Billy and to try to convince him not to publish this or not to attempt to write it and that and that Billy refused because he too was being kicked out of the army finally at the end of everything he was being out process and separated so it's just a it's a it's a crucial factor it's an operative fact in this in this murder mystery the fact that both of these guys who were found dead have been writing you know either a book or a letter which contained secrets that the special operations command really didn't want to get out how were Levine and Dumas killed specifically so Dumas in the place where they were found in the woods on Fort Bragg next to Lake MacArthur Dumas apparently had been killed execution style with a shot to the forehead Levine was found shot multiple times in the torso the raptor and blanket in place in the back of his own truck which was abandoned at that location so army CID which was the first law enforcement agency to investigate developed the hypothesis that Dumas had been contracted to kill Levine with somebody else that they had killed they had tracked Levine sit down somewhere and killed him wrapped his body in the blanket put him in the back of his own truck and then driven him out to this lake in order to get rid of his body at which point the truck got stuck out there because it had just rained and at that point according to CID's theory of the case the other guy the unidentified third man decided to kill Dumas to get rid of any witnesses and then he himself took the you know third man then took all the guns if there was if there was money there he took it if if there was drugs there he took it too because the site was sterilized there was nothing except for if you shell casings recovered from that scene when you when you report out a story like this like and you try to capture as much detail that it can be corroborated as much of the things you can get on the record what is it like to work on a story like this knowing like just like with the thumb drive there probably won't be any actual summation or conclusion to like a double murder like this the entire time I was writing the book I was haunted by the possibility that I would never figure out who killed Billy Levine and Timothy Dumas but the Department of Justice actually accused someone in 2023 formerly of this murder I don't want to spoil ending in the book but I will just say that the person they accuse is not at all who you would think I interview a lot of sources who cast doubt on the idea that he could have been responsible and he has pleaded not guilty and his trial is scheduled to begin in January of 2026 so that plus the other revelations new tips that I'm getting that are coming in as a result of the book's publication tell me that the that the story is not over yet to just like to bring the story like into the present day into into 2025 what do you make of the like the current state of jacock and their relation to this like perpetual state of war that this country is engaged in especially now that Trump is back in office and is flanked by you know a boso like Pete Hegseth and like what do you make of also like the transition from like the Joe Biden doctrine into the Trump to doctrine well it's always hard to know what jacock is up to because they leak so much less than the CIA and they're so secretive I think there's a fair amount of continuity across presidential administrations and how the the unit operates I can say that during Trump's first term he first of all surrounded himself with some of the kookyest people in the special ops community including of course Michael Flynn and he also introduced as I said before the jacock's rules of engagement aren't classified but according to the best reporting I've seen Trump loosened those ROE whatever they are and delegated authority to make decisions for targeted kills to commanders in the field Biden when he first came into office announced that they were going to do a big the inspector general the Pentagon was going to do a big investigation into potential war crimes committed by special operations many more reporters myself included believed that there would be some kind of reckoning with the announcement of this IG investigation but in typical like Biden and you know slash the democrats fashion it ended up being a complete you know it was nothing in the end I mean the report I read it it says nothing that they don't look at any actual war crimes they just examine the technical mechanisms that are in place for service members to report war crimes and offered these pittling you know tweaks to administrative regulations so Biden did nothing to reform these organizations now Trump is president again and I believe that all of the trends that I identify in the book will are likely to grow worse under Trump because of his uniquely malignant command influence including the rampant drug use among you know top Trump officials rolling stone published a great article some years ago about drug use in Trump's first White House and Trump's personal doctor Ronnie Jackson who went on to become a congressman you know Ronnie Jackson was a Navy officer and in a rock veteran a physician obviously and he was running an unlicensed pharmacy in the White House in which he was distributing prescription drugs to Trump staffers for free and without a prescription for which he was actually demoted by the Navy for that so I think that kind of you know just heed anistic and and decadent depraved atmosphere that exists in the in the top echelons of the republican party inevitably trickles down to military organizations like like jasak and delta in the whole green race yeah I mean I was just really struck about like this this repeated pattern like you know Obama and his empowering of jasak as like a global assassination racket or mafia or whatever just assassination hit squad and like the democrats of course they love it because it's so efficient ruthless meritocratic and like you know seemingly bloodless as far as the american public is concerned but then like they create the global apparatus for trafficking drugs and killing people but they want it to be respectable or just like they do a good job of trying to make it appear above all board but then of course as someone like Trump or the republicans get in power and then they have the keys to the same engine the same car that they get to drive now and they just get to have fun with it and just unleash the id of the american empire and how seemingly having fun doing it getting blitzed on infetymies and just killing people yeah that's a good way to put it and you know the people in this community also want to be respectable in fact it's interesting you hear nothing about good things about president Obama and the community they think he was the one of the best presidents not the best president whereas the support you hear for trump that's voiced among you know the operator community tends to be either more muted or just more mixed and there's certainly an argument that you can make as a person who belongs to like let's say delta force and cares about those institutions and their legitimacy that trump is actually really bad for them take the case of eddie gallagher you know he wasn't jaysock he was just a regular navy seal but you know the seals they wanted gallagher gone i mean he was a total disgrace to them an embarrassment but trump you know really elevated him and made you know the celebration of eddie gallagher part of his political persona but with regard to the respectability piece of it i wanted to also say that people in the community you know i do monitor the reactions because i care about what they think and it's informative to to to hear what they're saying and some of the criticism is sort of like you know what am i trying to say they are almost offended that that that that a writer or a journalist would would take a hard look at them and i want to say you go out and kill people as your job and then you're surprised that people are critical of that it is contradictory and you know if that's what you're dedicating your life to you shouldn't be surprised that people like me just think the entire enterprise is illegitimate i don't care if you follow roe i don't care if like you refrain from killing someone who surrenders like these guys want points for that or they want credit for that and i want to say you know i regard the entire delta force as an illegitimate institution it's carrying out lethal military operations completely in secret in a purportedly democratic country i don't even think it should exist at all so that's a little all over the place that response but your mission of respect to bill i mean that that leads into like i guess my like final final question i wanted to ask you which is more of like a existential or philosophical one something that struck me if you did this book is like when you invite in you know like a vampire like the demon of war and empire and then like you think it'll just be directed at the enemies of this country but like this world of secrecy and murder and corruption do you see its effects playing out in the broader american culture i mean like i just think like the way we have become so inert so like numb to this and i see these like obese morons cause playing as operators just signing up for ice so that they can intimidate guys in like a home depot parking lot i'm thinking about the way our entire political and media apparatus is more or less look the other way are actively supported just the unrestrained mass murder of civilians in Gaza like how do you see like the the culture and like the consequences of special forces playing out like in the broader american culture well you know that's a question that cultural analysis i think is very central to you know y'all's own project running this podcast because i can recall you know the first episode uh one of the first it's all did was making fun of that movie 13 hours oh my god yeah which is uh you know about uh the fucking verse that the secret soldiers have been gauzy in that movie they're portrayed as doing like arms by backs to like quote get them off the streets of the via but like they were just directly buying arms to ship to syria to like foamette like you know to fight a civil war that CIA base was responsible for transferring the weapons that had been in more market office a safe uh uh sock piles two ports on the Syrian coast where they could be transferred to you know radicals soony opponents of the a sub regime that later became you know hds and isis so that's a great example of how hollywood just completely inverts the reality of what these guys are doing in order to make them heroes now of course they're gritty complex dark heroes anti heroes but that's still a sort of airbrush view of the brutal reality that actually exists and there have been so many more movies like that as well from american sniper to the um what's the one where they're teamed up with the northern alliance on horseback oh they yes horse soldiers are 12 stars or sorry 12 like that 12 strong yeah 12 strong one of the most boring movies we have ever fucking watched for the show pretty bad that doesn't even deserve my criticism you're right but the other ones that are like zero dark 30 their lone survivor lone survivor of course yeah one of the lone survivors one of the most evil movies i've ever seen i mean i'd sad if i'm sure that you've talked to a few people who've brought this up just how like how much of that movie is just completely fabricated right the troll story in the first place yeah yeah a lot of these guys you know are known for their um you know for being liars i don't have to tell you that it's kind of the stereotype of of a navy seal in particular delta guys a little bit different um well they think they're now shut unlike the navy seal guys who are all gonna fucking book deal with the delta guys yeah more and more are going on podcasts and talking there's more of that drill than ever i wish i could have included even more of it in the book because there's it's really versioned over the last few years but to jump off on the cultural aspect of it you know this figure of an operator this figure of a bearded special forces soldier you know i write in the book about its centrality to a certain vision of masculinity in the united states and how it sort of reencarnate and recapitulates the tropes of the of the frontiersman and the cowboy and the operator is the 21st century version of all this you know the the rugged stoic man of violence who's bringing law in order to the gritty fringes of empire and this uh avatar of uh of uh american masculinity i think is deeply toxic and it has a huge influence on our culture you know talking about the guys joining ice but it's just it's you see it absolutely everywhere you see it people's clothes and the the trucks that they drive the way they act talk the media that they consume the way they think and approach the world um and i think that uh it is very ripe for subversion and that's one of the things that that i was trying to do with with my with my book is totally up in and subvert and invert this uh figure that's for so long been at the like apex of our cultural firm firmament you know uh to to no good effects well i i guess i'm like you know like the these guys like they follow your work and they're very cognizant of like both journalism and cultural depictions of you know themselves or what they do for a living like i know you mentioned that there was sort of a one-star review bomb of this book on amazon but like how do how do these guys interact with you and like are there anyone who have been supportive of your journalism yeah you know in the forums it's surprisingly there's it's there's a surprising amount of support for the work that i do because i think because i didn't wear rose-tended lenses at all and because so many journalists so i think are kind of you know i come from a very working class environment i came up through text to public school in texas and the army and so i don't have the sort of gauzy true-respecting reflexive attitude that i think a lot of reporters who come from the elite classes sort of um reflexively take towards the military because they're so remote from them like having actually their own guilt about never every considering joining the armed forces exactly yeah but because i i i i i to me i kind of know these guys you know at the portrayal of them in my book although it's obviously highly adversarial um it's also realistic in a way that other books are not and so and i'm saying a lot of things that a lot of guys in this community already know and that many of them perhaps think is a problem because you know although they're guided by a different sort of ethics than i am you know there are people you know what you could say the there are you know arguably good ones by that i don't mean that what they're doing and their work is good um but they're not just complete criminals they're not you know raping women or trafficking drugs or killing people by their own lights they're ethical people uh and they're actually concerned about some of the stuff that i've been reporting on so you do see a lot of supportive statements that are posted you know from people who are in the know that being said i recently discovered this thing called kiwi farms and i'm a little bit a little bit more shook than i was before because those discussions are a bit off the rails well yeah i mean like uh you you mentioned like uh these guys get offended i mean like you know i've offended people doing the show but i would be shook if i offended guys who like spend much of their adult life killing people and being trained to kill people at the highest level well i uh you know it's ironic because a lot of people point that out or ask me aren't you worried that one of them is going to do something but before this i was working you know as a war reporter and like uh Ukraine and Mexico and Syria and Iraq and stuff and so actually when i got the opportunity to write the book i was thinking well this is great i'll be able to do something that's safe or once not put my life at risk so i'm not sure what to you know i'm just going to have to go with a no comment on on that one i don't know what to say um but i don't let it affect what i write that's for sure i i don't censor anything that i write out of fear that there might be repercussions well uh sieth i i i i i'll leave it there for the day but really i i just uh would like to to reiterate uh for anyone listening out here like what we've discussed on today's show is just really like a tiny fraction of like the scope of the narrative that you've uh that you've really unfurled in this book and really like set uh for pratt cartel is an astounding piece of work and you should be really proud of it yeah i just want to echo what Will said about just how incredibly it's written you mentioned to eric canis book uh in this book and uh i've read that one and i've read all the mark bowden like you know the badass guys black caulk down every one killing Pablo i remember those books in high school it's just so great to actually read something about jaysock and bregg that isn't either like completely like blowing them or a guy trying to get a movie deal or is just um like scrolled with the cram like eric canis book well thank you guys so much for saying so i'm really glad that that you know you like the book and i'm so appreciative of the opportunity to hop on the pod and talk about it and for folks who are listening out out there you know if you can afford it you know buy the book because it helps to shift the over some window of what we're allowed to say about us foreign policy you know and the military when there's strong sales numbers that shows that there's there's a real market for this so thank you to everyone who was was bought the book and you haven't already please consider doing so if you can buy the book even if you can't afford it uh Seth Hart i really want to thank you so much for your time for the book the fort brag cartel is available in stores now once again Seth Hart thank you so much for the book and for your time today thank you guys and here we got scream a lot back over there i learned a thing too from charlatte don't you know you can just stay away from copper and rule",

      "text": "There you go. This is the jump right in. Why don't I give you an introduction and you can tell me if I miss anything. Amber Lee Frost is the author of Dirtbag, out now for Macmillan Press. Her writing can be found in Jackaban magazine, Catalyst, Damage magazine, Current Affairs, The Baffler, The New Republic, American Affairs, and many others. You can basically find it everywhere except for social media. Right. You're now free. You're now free. You cast off the shackles of social media and how is your life off the feed? You know, it was really interesting because it immediately affected my attention span. After a week, I could read through the whole paper. After a month, I was back to reading novels and after like three months, I went through Mobytick. It was like, oh, this is literally... There's a reason why the tech people let go of other tools. Greatest novels I've written. The reason why tech people don't let their children see screens until they're older. It's going to... When those studies get leaked, I know that with some of that Instagram, it's going to be exactly like a Philip Morris and all those executives who were doing their independent studies and saying, privately, like, I would never let my child smoke. Yeah. I mean, it's something like our generation's big tobacco, I think. I think it's comparable. I think it's just a chance. Yeah. I'm maybe. Maybe. I am reading about 5G. This is a very unrelated topic, but I am getting increasingly peeled on this. Yeah. I got metaphorically, but, you know, who knows? Who knows? I had read in advance of you publishing this book that one of the reasons that you got into political organizing among many reasons was that you saw the unnecessary economic hardship that your creative peers had to endure. And this is a podcast for Downwardly Mobile Creative. So we are directly in the crosshairs of that idea. Yeah. And I was wondering if maybe we could take this opportunity to talk a bit about your background in creative life and your background in music. Because I haven't heard you talk so much about that before, but I always felt a cultural affinity with you. Because I knew of the galleries and the institutions that you would talk at. And I thought, like, oh, Amber's experience is somewhat comparable to mine. Art and music are very different, but I had a sense that you were involved in a similar kind of precarious creative pursuit. Definitely. So, I mean, I, it's sort of that is creative, but I, you know, I also meant like more broadly. Like, people weren't able to have kids as early as they wanted to. Like, people, you know, people with emailed jobs suddenly didn't have any job security and their jobs were more grueling. It's sabotaged everything. I mean, for me personally, I had read about how people could, you know, work a job and play on the weekends and pay their rent. And I mean, New York has always been expensive, really was right. But like, it has not kept up with the wages, the inflation has not kept up with the wages. The rent is too high. And yeah, I mean, it's sabotage all kinds of things, but I was very frustrated because I was a musician and frankly a very mediocre punk band. But, you know, I, I always had interest in, I was always making something. And I think most people make something. It's just not really recognized. They have like projects and things like that. And the people who don't, I think a lot of the time, just don't have projects because they don't have the time. But, you know, precarity more broadly, like it killed the pleasures of life because you're so focused on survival. Thrive thing was absolutely out of the question, you know, measure and romantic love and a family. It's just like, I got to know fucking way. But yeah, I mean, I ended up in these galleries too, which is very interesting because people would like email me out of the blue. And they'd be like, would you like a speaking fee to talk about your article? And I'm like, sure. I'll absolutely do that, especially like when I first moved to New York, I was, you know, as unlike food stamps. And then I sort of got lumped into this world of like one foot in, one foot out kind of thing. I didn't exactly know what was going on with that. I had friends that were much more, that were much more involved in it. Like anicachian and stuff. But yeah, just vaguely creative circles. I like people who make things and it's very frustrating because it's very difficult to make things right now. It's extremely difficult to make things. And that has been the story of this project for the last few years. One of the things I always think about is that there's an artist who's, maybe I won't mention her name because it's not especially relevant. But the economic circumstances that she moved into in New York in the 1970s are very relevant, where she describes in advance of a major museum retrospective, this is something that you would do at the height of your career. You know, you get one of these in your life, grand survey of all of your work of decades and decades. And she describes moving to New York, working three days a week as a waitress, paying for both an apartment and paying for a separate studio, two pieces of real estate, and making largely, unsellable experimental video work. So imagining the cost of rent and the wage floor to sustain that type of life is, I mean, it's preposterous. Everyone I know works like at least six days a week and they can't pay rent in one place. They have like four different roommates and yeah, it's just, it's amazing how much like the space in which you could have that creative pursuit has just disappeared from people's lives. Yeah, I mean, I really strategized to get stuff done. And it was, you know, I'm a sneaky little hustler. So, you know, move to New York, got a job that I didn't intend to keep. I figured I would go back to waitress in a bar attending because you could actually make money doing that. But how did gay sort of blogging for an arts and culture blog? And it eventually did well enough that I could, you know, I could just, I could do that in a combination of another job, which was waitressing and then, and then teaching enough people liked my writing to, you know, a woman named Elaine Tobin, who's absolutely wonderful. And I owe so much to was like, hey, you want to teach it NYU? And I'm like, I kind of went to community college. I don't have an advanced degree and she's like, no, no, no, it's kind of a real estate venture with the university attached. But, huh? Yeah. It's like, you know, it's, it's a property hustle. Like they own NYU on so much shit. And she's like, one of the things that they can still do because it's such a lucrative, we'll say university and scare quotes is they still hire people who don't have advanced degrees because they, they sell it to, you know, the global one percent and all this poor middle class kids that are suckered into believing they're going to pay. And I'm just believing they're going to pay it off that, hey, to learn from real New York writers, real New York artists. And yeah, I put together a syllabus of my favorite kind of writing and taught freshman person second semester writing and I did that. And I got health insurance and then I got off Medicaid or whatever, which was horrible. And I hated a health insurance. I was like, I want to go back on the one system that works. And I was writing and then writing kind of got semi lucrative. I got a really good editor, Chris Laman who really liked my work and really improved it. You know, I just kind of dropped off of music because I'm like, I'm not that great at this anyway. I think a lot of people go through that, like sort of like zoom through different types of art until they find something that they really can enrich. And, you know, I lived at a legal three person sublet with Felix Peterman and McMullen for years. And we were able to just pay just shit, you know, very low rent to live in a black mold, you know, infested. A apartment. Yeah. We didn't realize. At first time I, like moved out got an apartment of my own ip text Nick and I'm like, I'm sick. But I realized this is the first time. Like I've noticed being sick and he's like, oh, yeah, we lived in an apartment full of black mold and I'm like, oh, you just you. You never realized how slowly and gradually you have lower expectations for habitation. And you don't realize you're like, the kulk has been done recently, you know, things are. So things are healing out of your bathtub. And yeah, the Felix and friends started a podcast in our soda Nick and our apartment. And you know, some of it's right place, right time. If we thought it was actually going to be successful, it will says that he said if I thought it was actually going to be successful, I would have named it something less stupid. But it did really well, shockingly well. And I'm like, well, I guess I get to do this in right now. And yeah, yeah, blessings upon me. But most of that was just kind of luck, which is a very strange thing to have to deal with is to be like, like, oh, I did all this hustling to get here and here and here. And then the thing that actually paid off was just a completely random happenstance thing. But the hustling just kept me afloat. The actual success and creative things just fell on my head. Yeah, I mean, the number of extraordinarily talented people I know who are working in New York, barely making ends meet, trying to find some way to survive. And then the housing stories that they bring back, Brad was telling me this story. This is back in like, I mean, it had to have been like 2010 or 11, but he, I don't know if I can tell this without his permission. But I'll say it anyway, whatever. Then I'll just came if I can say it. He went to see an apartment. He was doing the apartment hunt and he went to see his place in the McKibben lofts and the apartment had a dirt floor. The apartment was an unfinished section of the building that these guys, like their apartment was adjacent to it and they thought that they could rent out that like unfinished basement area to somebody as like their fourth roommate or something. But yeah, I mean, I've heard it from a few friends that like America is both a first and a third world country that both of these things exist in different areas. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I joke about, you know, Michael Harrington, one of the, you know, kind of, Trotsky critics of Stalin, which well, I won't get into that. But one of the founders of Democratic Socialist America, his big book was called The Other America. And it was about, you know, during the post-war affluence, there were still people like my man, Mom Pappall, who grew up without indoor plumbing or electricity. And we think of that as being a very rural, you know, a very rural thing. But I mean, when you look at the way we live in cities right now, again, New York has always been a little gross. But it's absolutely absurd the things that people are willing to put up with to be proximal to, I mean, that they have to put up with to be proximal to anything they might have a chance at, you know, a career. Yeah. And the thing that is so baffling to me now is that a lot of the people who are tolerating those conditions do not even believe in the legitimacy of the institutions they're trying to enter. So it's a very strange, it's a very strange period. Yeah, they just want to get by. On your earlier point of decreasing American attention spans, we watched the 1967 debate between Michael Harrington and William F. Buckley. That was a publicly broadcast debate for like an hour and a half on television, you know, decades and decades ago. And the idea that you could have a sustained debate that the public would be invested in care about, that their minds could be persuaded by two public intellectuals. Now we have like 15 second clips of Ben Shapiro on a podcaster. Yeah. Well, and I mean, we should just nuke the entire thing. It's would be a very welcome. Again, the internet being a public utility is that does light up my, I don't know what the externalities or costs of that would be, but it does light up my navy part of my brain. But I, I've said, you know what, we should turn it off at night to weekends. If there's a way, just like this way, just hold it off at night to be good. Yeah, absolutely, absolutely. There should be neck holidays or whatever. Just so we're not constantly connected. That, to me, would be a good, that would be a good start. To your point about like people sort of paying attention, I mean, it was good to have, I don't want to say a mono culture, but like a curated culture. Like the fact that we don't have DJs anymore, we, you know, have algorithms that sort of pick out things for you. You don't have like the cool guy at the record store who says, Hey, if you like this, you might like this or just play it is a different album like on the, on the speakers. So when you walk in to browse, you're getting it, you're getting samples. I don't know as much about the art world, but the curation also seems very crowdsource, which is very, very chaotic. I like the idea of people who are professionally in charge of a culture. I mean, people would say like there's not enough democracy in the economy. There's too much democracy in the culture. Well, that's the, yeah, that's kind of the great, the great irony of all these things is that our cultural institutions are necessarily structured as dictatorships, which is that you have one curator who doesn't deliberate the decisions. And that is what produces good culture. And so I've tried to make the argument over the past few years that I am a cultural elitist and an economic populist. And I don't find those things to be incongruent with each other. Same. Yeah. I want to ask though, some of the costs that your creative peers went through. I think one of the things that led me to the political solution for creative life, let's say for example, people are pursuing how to fit their work into the market better, how to get institutional grants so that they can have creative freedom. Each of those things, maybe it works, maybe it doesn't. The kind of less considered, but I think preferable solution is that you can exist in society of perhaps God forbid social democracy, wherein the wage floor is significantly higher. The rent is lower and you have more decommodified time to pursue whatever your creative passion, your hobby happens to be. The thing that you mentioned before about curation, these are kind of folded together is that as that space has disappeared from American life, our cultural institutions have also been subject to an elite capture where now you have these creative dictatorships in institutions, but they're entirely filled by kids who grew up with trust funds because the institutions pay such low rates, they pay you like $35,000 a year, and then no one else can afford to do that work unless it's subsidized by intergenerational wealth. So yeah, we kind of end up in the worst of all scenarios where we do have these spaces that could be curated, but they are filled with the taste of people who are totally out of touch of the mainstream of American life. Yeah, 100% and the only comparable thing in terms of it and their investments, art is an investment, I've written about it. The only other people that gets to decide the value of their own acquisitions is the tech industry. I mean, elites get to say, we're worth this much and we got to say we're worth this much. And it's like that, no one else is allowed to do that. That's to range. And the only balance you sort of have to do that is kind of a, in the arts is kind of a PMC crowdsource thing where it's like, well, we want more disabled women of color or we want more this and it's not the same thing as curation, it's sort of window dressing. And it is, it's a crowdsource, but it's still a elite crowdsource if you want to put it that way. But that butting up against say like a doc as Joanne or whatever, you know, who had Jeff Coons decide his mega yacht. It's like those are the two, those are the two ways that like art is, you know, valued right now. And they're both pretty debased and tragic. Speaking of Doc's friend of the stream, you wrote this incredible article in, I believe it was 2016 for current affairs. And this piece, this was on my syllabus when I taught at the School of Visual Arts, it was on my syllabus when I taught at RISD, the declining taste of the global super rich. And so it's a very interesting piece. It's, you have to kind of step outside of your own assumptions. I find this is very productive for people who are on the left and especially people who are educated in elite institutions who have to do a bit of deprogramming after graduating. Yeah. But maybe for people who have not yet read that piece, would you maybe give us a brief summary of the things that you were thinking about while you were writing that article? Sure. I think the thing is is that I always enjoy, I mean, I was very punk or whatever. And I liked the idea of being able to make things on my own. The way that sort of shifted is obviously that, you know, in the 1950s, if you wanted to buy a guitar and an amp, you could afford it. So that's why it got big. The same way podcasting got big. It's like low overhead. But I also always appreciated high culture. I sang opera in college. I love the symphony. I love the ballet. And I never thought of those things as sort of mutually exclusive, you know, whatever. I am a cultural leader, as well as appreciating the, you know, DIY punk stuff as well. But that stuff is in decline for a number of reasons. One, I don't want to blame modern art or anything like that. But a modern art has become essentially like a commodity that's being collected by the global rich. And they have bad stuff contaced. And also like they've sort of been infected by postmodernism, whether that's a different thing. But there's other things like say the EU, the EU has said, if we lend you money, you know, whatever, Portugal, you have to use it for certain things. You know, it's like a softer version of the Soros program. And you can't use it on restoring one of the most beautiful opera houses in Europe. I think to some degree, it's related to the fact that the elites at one point were sort of scared of a boxed popular or whatever. And they had to sort of concede certain things. They had to create publics or at the very least, you know, they had to institutionalize what I call the the PBS brain, which is the only reason I like Tired is that I had a mom that, you know, had was like, you're going to watch this 1970s, you know, performance of Shakespeare by some weird British people on, you know, in PBS, which is where I absolutely got that appreciation. I wouldn't have had exposure to her otherwise. But the idea of passing that over, of passing that responsibility over to the wins of the wealthy doesn't just mean, oh, it's stupid because they have bad taste or because they're commodifying it for collection. It's an investment to them. And it's also, they have wins. There was a really, really dynamic contemporary ballet studio that was funded by one of the Walten's. And it was hell. It was sort of like, it was kind of a, like a stripper set up where you don't really have a job. You sort of check in. You get fined for having a messy station. A traditional strip club is like, I don't know, it's, it's like freelancing on current back. The fact that they can find you for like leaving out your hairspray and that happens a lot is really funny. They would do the same thing to these, to these ballerinas and ballerinos. She decided she was bored of it and she just shut it down. The wealthy are mercurial because they can be. So there's obviously like a lot of things wrong with it, but I do think it relates primarily back to the fact that we've reduced public, public investment in the arts and the fact that the elites are no longer scared of the sort of like popular unrest. So they're like, I'm going to do that. I don't have to build a fucking beautiful library. I don't have to have free concerts in the park or whatever that I, that I, I remember going to a free concert at Lincoln Center. And I'm like, this is a really good idea because it was in the, and they just horrible heat of summer. And I'm like, this is what they do to prevent a do the right thing style riot. And that's, that is a movie fundamentally about weather. Like you have to give people something and they're, you know, they're giving us less and less, but we're so focused on survival that we can't even, we can't even do anything about it. Well, they're giving us Instagram is I think the way that they see it. Like while we build the platform for you to upload your own work and now everybody's liberated artist, the opiate of the masses and then the opiate of the masses also just opium. Like it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just a chance of being a content creator or sedating yourself chemically. It's very sad, but true. The thing that I really appreciate about the piece is that no blez oblige is a incredibly conservative argument. Yeah. But what you go through in the piece is actually that even I have to assume that this is meant for an audience of mostly people on the progressive left who would in almost every case prefer generous public funding, the, you know, ministry of culture that Portugal decided to disband because of European austereic conditions. That's preference number one. And then preference number two is that you have this generous private support, no blez oblige and so on. Even that is dissipating. And so if you can't sustain that, it almost feels like, oh, talking about increasing public funding for the arts is like, you guys are in the wrong chapter. You're in the wrong decade. Like we're actually this far away from the problem now. Absolutely. We have to like base, base, let's focus on just scaring the shit out of them enough to get like, you know, three days, three days at the museum. Let's start with that and then we'll move on to having a ministry of culture. There's there may be another side of this at work also. I spoke, I think it was about this time last year and December of last year. I was at art basil in Miami in December. And I spoke, I spoke on a separate panel about different topics, but I sat also through a day of different lectures about people who generally their job is to do philanthropy and provision arts organizations and so on. And one of the women I happen to know who works in that space was talking about how there's a change over in the generational hands in which these philanthropic trusts and endowments are managed. And so perhaps the grandparents cared about opera or ballet or theater and so on, but the grandchildren, this newest generation, they don't particularly feel a responsibility. I think as you phrase it in the piece to be stewards of the sublime, to give something back to culture. And instead, the topics that they prefer to donate to are, she listed social justice and climate change. And so there's a transformation of the value system of our economic elites also that has a kind of generational tether to all of these things. And I started thinking that if a large portion of the ideology of our cultural institutions and our elite publications in the last few years has to do with kind of hating this conservative reactionary figure that lives in a state that you've never been to and someone you've never met. The idea of creating a culturally enriching experience for that person is kind of counterintuitive. Like why would you give back to enrich a population that you so thoroughly despise? Right. No, that's a really good point. It's also just like, why waste opera on the bumpkins, but also I don't even like opera. But yeah, I think the whole, you know, stewards of the sublime is a very, is a very dated thing. I think you're right that part of it is taste of change, impulses change, the plausible denial ability that they're hoarding wealth and that's evil is is reoriented around things like climate change and, you know, diversity initiatives. But I think some of it is that frankly, it's just cheaper. I had someone, an opera singer said like he's like, okay, well, the thing about the opera. There used to be like these mini opera things that we're going in Bushwick. We're a bunch of professional opera singers. You can go see it. It's very minimalist. It's like very cool. But, and you know, definitely go see it. It's cool. But like there are certain things that aren't supposed to be punk. You know, maybe they could be both, but you want the big, big, big production. And he's like, the thing is everyone gets together. There's a, there's Norris Strother, all these people, there's costumes, there's lighting, there's all this stuff that goes into it. And then it's done and it goes away. And you don't get credit for it after it's done. It's an event. It's creating something very big, you know, sublime. You don't get an asset too. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. And you don't get something that, you know, essentially you have to keep doing over and over or maintain like a foundation or something. But I don't, I don't even know how grants work anymore. They were like sort of shifting around the time that I wrote that. So maybe that's like a dated, you know, a dated observation. You know, the way the way the ultra wealthy funnel and laundromoney, you know, for their own, again, plausible deniability that they're hoarding wealth of, of Horrods shifts a lot. And over I think an increasingly short period of time, I think everything, I guess, happens over increasingly short. Everything that happens faster and worse. It's speeding up. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, speeding up. I mean, I can, I can attest to the conditions in opera or ballet, obviously, but within the art world, I know my peers in Europe, it's conditions of austerity for decades where, you know, the millennial artists and the Netherlands, for example, what they can count on is like a, you know, 50% of fraction of what the generation before them would get. So it's, it's closing down kind of, kind of everywhere. But let me ask you about the book. The book is written from inside the perspective of the millennial movement for socialism. And you have been involved in that for many, many years. Over a decade at this point, you are a extremely early DSA member before you moved to New York. You've been writing for 10 plus years, podcasting, and of course, there's the Bernie campaign. The book describes the successes and failures of the millennial movement for socialism. And I didn't write any of that copy, by the way. I just, you know, saw sort of a romantic memoir kind of thing. And I'm like, whatever. Yeah, call it that. Whatever. Is it, is it a social history of millennial socialism? Man, I don't know what it is. I honestly, like, I had kind of a crisis when I was writing it. And I'm like, I don't know, what's the fucking point of writing this? Like, everyone kind of knows what happened with Bernie. And I don't want to get into a sort of Monday morning quarter backing, which it would be more like Tuesday, Thursday at this point. I didn't want to, you know, go through the sort of granular ways in which that campaign was felt. Well, you know, there's more sabotage from inside the DNC than anything else, and Bob Blower, who knows that. And then I sort of, I was like, well, I never really went into it. Like, wanted to do like, I got more and more. Because that's, I waited actually a very long time before writing about myself because during, when I was kind of writing, there was kind of a trauma industrial complex. I wrote something about it for the baffler and a book review that was like, this, this, it was like this book of like, all of these women talking about their, it was different accounts of their sexual assault. I'm like, this is like the worst idea. It's just like, all gathered together in a book. Yeah, like a, a, a, a, a, it's just like, oh, awesome. A rape coffee table book. What kind of perverse weirdo is going to read through that? It was disgusting. And I felt it was very exploitative for like a number of reasons. I felt like economically exploitative. But also no shrink would recommend that like, if you're still reeling and suffering from something that you go out in like essentially a literary public square and announce what happened to you. Like no, no like, you know, ethical mental health professional would be like, yes, shout it from the rooftops. You don't have any interiority. You don't have any privacy or just see with your loved ones, you know, everything is public. And it fit in with the largest trend of at this time, you know, they're like bustle and things like that. I think Jezebel was still kind of fun and slow at the point. But you get like $50 to write about the worst thing that ever happened to you. Yeah, yeah. And not only was that like garbage, but it's like, you get one shot at that. And a lot of these women were very like green writers and they weren't emotionally or artistically prepared to write about something with that kind of weight. So it would be a bad essay about the worst thing that ever happened to them that was being aired publicly before they had any sort of like emotional recovery from it that they were paid like 50 bucks for. So I took a very long time and I just wanted to write about political economy. And then I wrote, I wrote an article called Daddy Issues because I saw like this very strange thing where people were like, you know, I've always been anti child support because I had a quote unquote deadbeat dad. And I'm like, well, she, she had my mother had to have another job chasing down a bipolar guy for money. He sometimes didn't even have like that became a second job. And I'm like, no, this is the sort of thing like children should be cared for by the welfare state. And I think that's not made. Yeah. Yeah. And families broadly should be should be cared for by the welfare state. And that was the first time I sort of like used my experience to drive home. And I sort of did this thing where I woven personal experience after I think I've gotten a lot more experience just writing. And I had it again, Chris Lehman was an amazing editor. I was ready to write about that stuff. And I'm glad I waited. And when I taught when I taught a NYU, I wrote all of the, I, my syllabus had like, you know, David wrap off and Fran Leibowitz and Lucy Saunt and all of all of these people that wrote very interesting, particular sometimes intimate, but never like, you know, devastating things. And then the very last thing on my syllabus that I signed was an Ariel Levy, I say that I think it's called Thanksgiving in Mongolia. And it's about her having a Missed Carriage on a trip to Mongolia. And it was like a second, just like a trimester, like a trimester miscarriage. So it did, you know, look like a baby. And it was devastating. And I'm like, you know, you guys, I, I, I saved this one for last because I didn't want, you know, there's a, there was, say there were 19 people in the class. I'm like, I didn't want to get back 19 dead babies. I wanted. I wanted. I wanted your, you know, your paper, your response to this to come after you have some, some work in. So this is just a very roundabout way to say that I, I wanted to work in personal experience to, you know, essays about political economy and political power because I don't want, those are my favorite kind of political memoirs and political writing. And two, I think you kind of do a disservice to writing about a moment when you maintain distance from it completely because you sort of come across this that with it doesn't have a life. You come across that one who has a political life and doesn't have a real life. And I think it is important to, you know, at least for, for my kind of writing to sort of be honest about the fact that, yeah, this wasn't the only thing going on in my life. Like there is, and even then there, even in the political stuff, there was a lot of personal things that go into that. It's a, it's a very sensitive thing. Even if you, even if you have, I think, a good perspective on it and you don't believe you know, you're putting the red flag over the rigs, like you, you know, it's being serious to mind it does not exclude being a person. That's kind of what I finally arrived at when I was like, no, no, no, I am going to, you know, fuck COVID, fuck my, my sort of paralysis and how to write that. I'm like, you know, write what you saw and what you were doing. And some of what I was doing was, you know, being pissed off and getting drunk and, you know, making friends and having little adventures. And I also didn't write the copy that ever, that, you know, he said the train station or something like that. But it's like, well, no, I want to pull people in. But moreover, I want people to, to read about someone who had a political life and a real life. Well, I think you write in the book that you do have a life in cultural interest and hobbies outside of politics. And you write that politics shouldn't be your hobby. Yeah. You want socialism to be done so that you can get back to all of the other stuff you enjoy about life and to be especially aware of the people who come to the movement and don't have friends or interests outside of it. It's very weirdly underdeveloped people who their entire life is like being a nerd or, basically not a nerd for the history, like a nerd for the lore, like they're collecting lore of the 19th century type of shit. That is such a good point. That is such a good way of putting it. That is such they turn it into the Marvel universe or whatever. Yeah, that's not canon actually. That's and they have some like a lot of exploitation for it. But it's mostly the same, the same dispute. They're absolutely right. I'm like, what does contemporary America have to do with what Lenin said? I mean, there's certainly evaluations you can take from that. And I think, you know, it's fun to read marks and it's interesting to have sort of a rooting in selfish list and communist history, especially because we're sort of living in the crater of it, you know, the history, so to speak, maybe slowly climbing out of it. But yeah, you're right. It's lore. It's all about the Marvel universe. And it's like, yeah, you should be wary of people who come into it without friends, without interests, without a life. Because if you go into politics looking for friends, you know, you're going to come into it with the wrong agenda, you know, just get a personality. Like try that. You're going to step into the fence and humor. Do that and then go into it because I never wanted it to be cool or a club. I wanted it to be. I always say I wanted socialism to be the wallpaper, you know, something you sort of forget about. I wanted it to be, you know, normies and, you know, parents and middle American suburb inites. I wanted it to be an actual mass movement. Yeah. Yeah. And I wanted it to be so entrenched in the society that people don't question it and then they get really pissed off when they see any kind of bunch towards austerity. Then when they see like what they're, oh, they're lowering food, food stamps, I guess. I mean, when I say food stamps, I mean that everyone should have food stamps because there was a Swedish saying that like bad social welfare helps the poor, good social welfare helps everybody. Because then when people are like, oh, they're taking away $15 worth of our food stamps, everyone gets pissed off. Right. Right. You know, it's seen as an actual collective good. It's not just to help the destitute or whatever because once that happens, you have an extremely marginal group of people who are fighting really hard to survive again. I want, I just, yeah, it's true. I want it to be done. I want it to work and I want people to have a sense of, you know, pride and investment in it and a sense of, you know, a sense of social responsibility. I want to live in a society, Cidarella. That's what I'm going to say. I just want to ask, I don't want to, I can only agree. I just want it to be boring and done. I, I mean, I have always said to you, I mean, I call them students, but I guess they're listeners to the podcast because I don't teach anymore. But I've always said that I just want the stuff from politics. Like, I have, I'm into art. I'm into all these other hobbies. Like, I have my cultural identity, but I need all of those other people to get the stuff. And if I don't have them, then I'm not going to go to the dentist, which I have not yet gone to the dentist. So I am with all the cultural identities. One of the things that seems to be particularly in the way of American socialism is something called the professional managerial class, which we have talked about at length on this podcast. I'm not going to define it because we have included it in multiple syllabi and different podcasts. And you have written about this extensively. I'm thinking of a piece published in American Affairs in 2019, the characterless opportunism of the managerial class. Right. This has been one of the topics that we've done quite a bit of research into. Friend of the stream, former host of the Jacobin show on YouTube and also the podcast, author of a forthcoming book that I have to check in on. Jen Pan assigned us the death of a yuppie dream, the rise and fall of the PMC. Yeah. Text. So I'm going to be biased here. I'm extremely pro Jen Pan, long time friend. I'm, yes, I'm really excited for the book and we'll have her definitely back on the podcast when the book comes out. That's, it's this year or 2024, I should say, but very, very soon. And so I took, I took her recommendation very seriously. So we read through the Aaron Reich's piece. This is published in 2013. And it basically, the brief summary is that it looks at employment statistics for people, post-war 60s, 80s, 2000s, all the way up to roughly the Occupy era. And they describe the rise and fall of the professional managerial class as the title suggests. And so I then, I brought this up to other friend of the stream, Catherine Liu, author of Virtue Horders, I believe that's 2021. Almost. She's excellent. One of my favorite episodes. People, very interesting that Bayaniel Curator's listened to that episode with Catherine Liu and they fucking loved it. They really went wild. There's some kind of unspoken, uneasy alliance in the art world that is rapidly, rapidly disintegrating, especially in the last few weeks. But the thing that I'm interested to tease out here is that Catherine's reading of the death of a yuppie dream was that she disagreed with the Aaron Reichs. And her idea was that the professional managerial class did not fall around the Occupy era, but actually it grew in strength, not fractional infighting or whatever, but just a kind of theoretical thing that I'm interested to solve. And I'm wondering, where do you stand on this analysis? Because for me, like a emboldened, empowered professional managerial class would go a long way to explain some of our cultural landscape. But then I understand there are also employment statistics that in different places, they tell different stories. So where do you fall in that dichotomy? So I mean, I do agree with Catherine. I think I love Barbara for being an empiricist. I think she does have a point. I mean, this sounds like I'm fenced, straddling here. But Catherine is definitely right, she also appears. Catherine is definitely right that the professional managerial class as a unit has grown in power, and that they have a kind of class solidarity, which is strange because they all want to rip down the throats out. I would actually describe them as, I think the best comparison, and I've thought of this before, which I think synthesizes the Aaron, I do think Aaron Reich is, she's a little gentle with the PMC, but I, by the way, I love her God rest your soul. But I would compare them sometimes to the military. So the American military has grown wildly. I mean, it's a little bit diminishing now because like, you know, kids are like, why would I do that? But it's expanded, it's bloated. But the life of the individual of American soldier has gotten shittier and shittier. I know people who have like, you know, gone to bases and like, they just immediately signed you up for food stamps. I remember learning that like, oh, you get free college, but when I was in school, because it was, you know, basically community college, it was satellite campus, but it served the purpose of community college that these, they'd have to leave in the middle of class because they'd be deployed. And then they wouldn't get credits for that class. So they were always, they didn't really have benefits. The benefits that they said, say they were going to get, but same time, military in power, they, you know, it doesn't mean we have a lot of wins, pretty bad at stuff, but it's expanding and spanning, it's bloated and swelling and swelling. But if you look at the individual units, the human beings involved, shittier and shittier lives. So it is, it's even counterintuitive, but obviously there's precedent for it. And I think the PMC, you know, the numbers of their, they're more precarious. They can't keep up with, you know, inflation like anyone else. They work so much, so much more than than previous. I mean, like I always look at this letter, Hunter S. Thompson sent to his editor, the Ed Rolling Stone, they were only offering him, get this only offering him a dollar award. And that was like 1976 dollars. And I'm just like, yeah, and all to be a writer in 1970. Only a dollar award. And he was like, how dare you insult me with this, you know, thing. So yeah, I mean, the, the other thing is they do weirdly have a class solidarity. This is the other in congruence, you know, seemingly irreconcilable thing. They do have a weird class solidarity when it comes to being represented as professionals and people who should be in charge of managing things. But they are the most ruthless people on earth. Yes, they are. They are always ripping each other's throats out. So even as much as they have a solidarity of an identity of a professional, they hate each other. It's this very strange evolving aspect of not just the labor force, but the sort of the political orientation of the country that seems to disagree with itself all the time. And I always wonder how sustainable it's going to be. You know, I don't, I don't think of it like a true workers class consciousness is going to emerge from the PMC. I had a friend who God blesses heart. He was like, I think I'm going to, you know, you need to ice my, my tech floor thing. And I was like, honestly, I died. I have more faith in the unionization of SS prison guards like there's no, at least they have a national project that they believe. But guys, they all believe that they are rugged individuals. They don't care about each other at all. It's built into the culture. And I don't mean that it's a bunch of ego maniacs that gravitate towards it. I'm saying you can't work or exist in that world without, without just falling prey because I do think it's a victimizing thing to that ideology, to that rugged individualist and it's like, dude, you're, you're proletarianizing just like everyone else. Well coding, yeah. Same thing with grad school. They'll be like, no, no, no, I'm going to be the one who gets a tenured professorship. That's another thing that would be created in 1976. Yeah. It's like, look at not how do you think you're the exception. And it's just, it's the ideology built into the, into the industries. Well, we are, we are at some kind of inflection point where certainly pursuing higher education graduate degrees in the United States, many people are never repaying those loans. And not everybody has access to intergenerational wealth where they can just pay for a higher education, just for, you know, personal enrichment or something like that. So I, I do think that do not research, for example, I know there are people who use this podcast as a supplement for their MFA education where they get more relevant information. We talk about literally the exact same content that was on my syllabus and the universities. And they just get a year for $5 instead of $50,000, which is, you know, I would encourage those people to increase their monthly contribution on Patreon. But I think that the larger issue is that there's a kind of clear economic wedge that's being driven down creative life. And in some cases, it's not worth recouping. The professional managerial class as the Aaron Rikes were writing about it in, I think, what is it? Radical America 1971 or 73, this initial definition, you know, they include nurses in that, which today when I think of the PMC, I think of Blue Check journalists on Twitter. And so over time that that class or the colloquial definition has kind of shifted. So yes, some parts of that class have become incredibly powerful and other parts of it are relatively disempowered. Right. I think it makes sense to clarify and draw those distinctions as much as we can, even as being like PMC is kind of nebulous. But like, okay, one, nurses are professionals because they have to pay to play, which is another reason we're having this insane nursing shortage. It's like, it's cost too much to become a nurse. It used to be that the university in general, and at least in the time of mass increase with circulation, was paid to play. It's now you have to pay, and it's like, you're not even guaranteed a job. But I think the idea of nurses is that like, okay, well, you might manage a hospital floor, but most nurses are grunts. I think the managerial part of it, and I think Catherine Luz very good on us, where she's like, not against professionalization. I just don't believe that this class of people are also equipped to manage everything, because they have a class, they have a class interest in managing it a certain way, let's say. And yeah, nurses don't really make sense to include it, and less a little bit you want to put. I don't even know if managing a hospital floor, I think that might be just like managing Taco Bell. You're not really a manager what you make the schedules. To me, manager, the big difference is, do you determine wages, and are you in charge of hiring and firing? And I think those are sort of the hard lines that I've used to actually go for PMC. Yeah. I think, well, that's a useful definition. The last thing I want to ask you here is that there's a few things that we've discussed. I think you mentioned some potentials of this in some of our earlier conversation. There is some legislation, which seems to be relatively unique in the neoliberal period of this economic consensus between both Democrats and Republicans, but really all major parties across the advanced world. Let's say this roughly tracks from the 1980 to 2020, and then there's things that are moving now. People have called this in some cases the industrial policy renaissance, things like the Chips Act, the Infrastructure Act, the Inflation Reduction Act, you'd even include the Green Deal in Europe. These things have an increased level of state investment and interventionist hand in the economy. In some cases, they include the reshoring of industry. And I wonder if there's maybe like a kind of peak in valley for relatively bad and relatively good periods of capitalism. Would it be conceivable that we are just scraping the bottom of one of those valleys for the next few years? But there is something like an upswing under which the conditions for the possibility of organizing, if you do reshore industrial manufacturing, like those are jobs you can do, old school organizing in, but the tech floor, you can't really organize your Slack channel, but you can organize your shop floor. So in addition to all the cultural aspects of it, just the kind of practicalities of being on the ground and organizing and so on, those things do seem to be shaking up. So I guess where do you fall in this threshold for optimism about the larger scale transformation and the potential to exit this neoliberal consensus? Honestly, I love it. I don't think it's necessary. I think it will be, or rather I suspect it will be essential to invest in infrastructure. Another fascinating thing I've had is that there is a labor shortage. We don't have enough hard hats. We don't have enough logistics people because they're told that's shit job. You want to go to a lot of them aren't shit jobs. It's insane. If you, like say for example, have a prison record and you're trying to get back into the labor force becoming a union carpenter is you can get in with a record. You get a good job. If you're a teamster, they're working their way up. They're organizing. I'm very, very, I find that very promising. And I just think industrial manufacturing is also, like it's geography. Like you said, you know, tech can't organize their slackshad. It's true. I mean, being in the same place, it's sharing a geography is actually true. This is why I argue that next door is the only truly social media because it actually is a community, whether you like it or not. People are in spitting distance. I don't know how much this investment is going to be, but any foothold in, you know, ensuring any investment in manufacturing, any investment in infrastructure, which is also fascinating. I just want that. I have said this before. It's like, you know how we were talking about you adjust your expectations when you move to New York and you slowly lower your standards for levelable conditions. We've done that. And I think historians will look back on that. We've done that with the entire infrastructure of the country where we just sort of, they'll say, yeah, they just sort of slowly accepted that sometimes bridges collapse. Sometimes they're huge, you know, environmental disasters. Sometimes dreams just fall off the tracks. We don't even think about it. It's just like me going, oh yeah. Yeah, yeah. We just got used to it. So obviously like I want us to invest in those things. I think public investment in jobs, in work, in projects that provide a geography for people that are already unionized workforces, those to me, I believe are the way forward. Hey, I could be wrong, but I got to say they've had the advantage. They've always had the advantage. They have the advantage more than nurses and teachers. I love nurses and teachers, but the cool thing about being a truck driver or, you know, a union electrician or working on an assembly line is you are in a horrible amount of debt to university. You have a position of comfort. If not comfort, a kind of security that they don't have, they're not, you're not constantly worried about your credit being destroyed by fucking NYU or even the community colleges have like shot up. I would like to see also growth in trade schools, you know, like the whole like stuff going to college. Like it, it sounds like no, absolutely. I believe in pursuing the, you know, the liberal arts as well. I believe in a broad based educational experience. I think what you're doing here is great. And I like that people have a lot of access, even though we both agree with once in curation to different podcasts about history and economics and et cetera. The promise we were made that going to college would get us a job is clearly a lie. But hey, you know, Biden wants to throw, you know, $50 million into building more bridges. That's more union jobs. We don't even have enough people for them is we're going to see more people, especially the kids, you know, getting like journeymans and like, you know, working their way into union work. I'm, I dare I say excited about that. I love it. I love it. No, that's a great news. You know, I'm glad to hear your enthusiasm because I've been like quietly thinking, man, this is like really good. And I'm afraid to say it because I know people are going to just like jump on me. It's like, you're going to give Biden credit. Is it, no, no, it's nothing to do with Biden as a, as a unique individual. It's just like, there's a, there's a consensus among elites and that we're in a different period. These things are, you know, slow. It's going to take 40 years. But it's like, this is good news. This is good news. This is good for the working class. This, it doesn't matter who did it. I don't think Biden did it to be good for the working class. No, he doesn't care. Really give a shit. Yeah, I, I don't matter. It doesn't matter. Yeah, yeah. Didn't even do it. It says whatever, come ball of skexes did it. But like, you know, I, it's, it's good. This is good for the working class. And whether you did it for popularity is completely irrelevant. Yeah. I'm, I'm, I'm excited about that. I, and I have to plug again, I wrote something for damage about the infrastructure bill about how like, well, it should have been Bernie. It's not just because he would have, he would have loved it and he would have invested way more, way more. But because it, and it could, an executive order, too, there's certain things he could do without, without going to Congress. He, like, he also would have taken credits. And it's very important to take credits. Oh, yeah. I know there's Biden projects going on all around me, but it should have been, it, he should have been like singing it from rooftops. Like, this is what, just from perspective, hey, but this is what we, this is what we gave you. This is an FDR strategy. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. And it was absolutely, you know, he, he doesn't again deserve credit and it's completely cynical and I, I don't give shit. But if they were smart, if they were smart bastards, they would do this. And Bernie would have been smart enough to be like, by the way, this is what social democracy gets you. Instead of people believing like, oh, good Biden would do this. But like, like, what do you, what do you, you're not even taking a victory lap? You dumb, fucking Democrats. Like, this is one good thing. You do one fucking good thing for the bad reasons who cares. And you're not even like using it to your advantage. Do they, they like losing? They must fucking like losing. Yeah. Yeah. There's some kind of, yeah, fetishistic, weird thing going on that's, yeah. I mean, I think. The underdog. They, they do. I think the, the, the last thing that I'll, I'll say about this is that I'm involved with an artist run space here in New York called Don Kunsthal, which is a, you know, a Kunsthal and an old abandoned Dunkin' Donuts. And there's a show up right now from Nancy Holt. You say, canonized artists from, you know, works from 69 to 78 spanning that period. And I was sitting there and what it was at the last Saturday. And you know, there's a bunch of people coming in from that generation. And they tell me stories about that peer group of artists, you know, Nancy Holt, Robert Smiths and this guy comes in. I won't mention his name, but he was telling me he's like, yeah, you know, in the 1970s, I was a plumber, me and Philip Glass. We were, we were both plumbers in Soho. And that was just the normal job that they worked. And then they went on to have these incredible creative careers and like, that was, that was great. That's what like, that's what that period of political economy gave you. That's what sustained all of their work. That's what built the canon. You could work a straight job and still make stuff. And I don't even think that has to apply to professional artists like whatever. You want to spend fucking 10 hours a week quilting, you know, if you want to, you know, whatever, paint your house a stupid color, anything you want to do involving aesthetics or the arts or whatever, you should have time to do that. And honestly, I don't see that as having a bunch of professional artists. Maybe isn't the way to go. Maybe I would be completely fine working a straight job 25 hours a week and then being left to my, left to my own devices. I think everyone deserves that. Whether, even if you're a completely untalented artist, you know, no, you just have your own self-sustained scene of like your niche interest and it doesn't need to scale. And that's like, that's perfectly fine. That's what every you want to do. It doesn't need to scale. It doesn't need to scale. It can be if it has a popular following that can happen organically. Amber, thank you so much. This has been just your, I should say, your writing, your thinking on these topics over the last few years has been such an incredible influence has guided, you know, so much of my own thinking and my references, the readings, you know, the syllabi that I give students and listeners of the podcast. So thank you for joining us today. Your book, Dirtback is out now from McMillan Press. Here's the best place for people to purchase the book. So, you know, it's the anywhere you get books. What would be cool is if you can stand to pay the extra $4 markup or whatever, as if you call your local bookstore and ask them to preorder it for you. One, because if they get enough of those, they'll, you know, I'll get it in the window when it'll be more people will fucking read it. But two, I like bookstores. I like, you know, I like public spaces where you can peruse around and not even necessarily spend money. So if you could do that, take a little bit of the markup. It's great. If not, you know, every, there's the non evil Amazon option. Or let's be honest, ethical consumption doesn't work. I don't think you're a bad person if you order from Amazon. I won't touch you. Yeah, yeah. I don't think we'll get this out before the fifth, but I will promote to social media. I'll give people a preorder like, yeah. So, you can find this everywhere. Books are sold. Very excited for it. Oh, thank you. Thank you so much. This is my favorite. And I love what you're doing here. This is awesome. I'm glad people can like have a fucking education that doesn't cost them an hour in a leg and explore ideas, which is sorely needed. Thank you so much. I appreciate that. Thank you.

      "episode": "My Political Journey J.txt",
      "text": "I'm located in the south of the United States, about 22 years old, close to being 22. If I wanted to describe myself as someone online, I would say that I'm a reactionary. I feel that the ideals set up since the enlightenment about human rights, about the autonomy of the individual, the way we speak about them, I think that is a farce, and I feel that I need to get back to a time where either we talk about things in terms of how good the quality of life is, or in terms of how aligned we are to a higher power. My biggest influence as of now is Joseph Demester. He wrote this book called St. Petersburg Dialogues, and the first time I heard about it was just about a year ago. He's possibly my biggest influence, and if you're talking about just kids or a theorist, so it's in Nick Land's work, it's pretty good. There's this one chapter of Bang New Miner called Machining Desire, and that was something that really influenced me the first time I read it was a few years ago, but at the same time I was also doing some software engineering at the time, and it was two software engineering that I learned about Nick Land and Mold-Buck and stuff. At that time it represented something really different to me, compared to what it does today, and at that time it was more something along the new reactionary canon, but it's more along the technological, futurist lens. You would see a lot of people who are in favor of trans-humanist thought, aligned with this kind of mostly anti- and like-man-anti-democratic ideology. In real life, where I'm not anonymous, I use almost everything, because I'm in the workforce so I have a LinkedIn, I have a Facebook, I have a Twitter, I have an Instagram that is separate from my anonymous Instagram, and other than that, if you're talking about the stuff that I use anonymously, I use Instagram the most, but I keep back up accounts almost every time. Move to at least five, so you usually see me on mostly my fifth one. And also to explain is that many make sure that your name is like Libertarian poster version two. You pretty much have started like your account to get zuck, so that's where it is better to name it something else, rather than V2 or V3, because Instagram is able to figure that out pretty quickly. And I realized that mostly the reason that I was getting banned is the kind of pictures that I used to post. For example, Instagram can detect, you know what the black sun is, the black sun symbol, so it can detect that, it can detect a bunch of other stuff, so if you post those things, you automatically get like a stripe on your account. If you get more than five strikes, then your account is like that. And as of now, I've had this account for over like 10 months, and this is probably the longest I've had an account, as long as you don't use the stuff that you know is going to get you banned, you're going to be fine. When did you first learn about or start visiting online political communities? Probably 2017 beginning. I also had taken a political science class, my freshman year, and I had taken a political accomplished test at the time. That was probably the first time I'd ever taken it, it came out in the middle, but then I got into a relationship, and she was sort of political, so like I wanted to like impress her more, but like my political knowledge. So it started off like that, so like I started to read more and stuff like that, like she was a libertarian, so like I started to read more stuff along these lines, and I entered like political communities, like Poland, lefty poll, there were a few Facebook groups, so like I entered these groups around start of 2017. I used to be pretty libertarian around like most things, but then I realized that like, especially about my like, inclinations towards the environment, libertarians do not have a good solution on what needs to be done along those lines, and also I realized that I feel like logic does not really matter as much as I thought, I used to try to like think, okay, is this the right way, is this the right way to like move forward, is this like just this prove anything, does this actually predict outcomes and stuff, and I realized that shit does not matter, matters like if you're able to like get stuff to be done. I feel that just turned me more like pragmatic, and from that I was able to move towards the right or like off the left or off the center. You had mentioned a thinker that was very influential to you, that forgive me if I butcher the pronunciation here, I want to say Vier Savarca. Yeah, Vier Savarca, he was an Indian thinker. The reason why like I initially got into him was because like he was a he was an atheist, and he was an atheist and he was right wing, which is pretty much like non-heard of, at least in the time that he was most prominent, or 1947-1948, on the time where like India was trying to gain independence, and like it's a no joke that like Gandhi was not as good as people say he wasn't, he genuinely wasn't. He was kind of like a cocked Indian, if that makes sense. Like yeah, he did cause independence, but the reason why Savarca was resonated with me was that he was atheistic, he was for the nation, and he was also for like you know being pro-science, while at the same time being pro-culture. He has influenced BJP a lot, so like a lot of people in the BJP that you see there, nationalists, while they're also like social democrats, but more along the capitalist side. So he has influenced BJP a lot. I was sort of raised Hindu, and like I feel like I'm getting back into like vegetarianism and stuff because of like the environment, the consequences of like eating meat, you know, so along those lines, I was able to find myself in Hinduism. The reason why like I got into it was because of V Savarca. Dugan has espoused something called as a multi-polar road view. Dugan is in favor of cultures being by themselves, but at the same time growing, knowing that there are other cultures out there like them. So he is really different from the right in that he understands understanding of cultural relativism. So like he is pro-China, he's pro-India. I was seeing a right-wing Indian news agency mentioned this, and I said that Dugan is in favor of them, and also India is in favor of whatever Dugan espouses. This is interesting, and also I've read like a few blog posts by him, and it kind of like resonates with me. Do you spend any time on YouTube and what content producers do you like? So like I don't really listen to any political content anymore. I like to watch animal videos and stuff. I don't really watch any political content as such unless once in a while I see a video or make fun of this is D-Live livestream, or I see a few other underground political thinkers that I've interacted with. Other than that, I don't really watch anything else. I don't listen to any podcasts as such, but I've listened to a few episodes of the Revex Care podcast because a friend like Sir Dusted said that, oh you will agree with them. I sure will like listen to a few episodes of them and then like yeah they're decent from what I hear. I've watched like ContraPoints videos. I agree with some of them, but like I'm not going to change like what I believe in just because of you know what she said. I do like intake content from the guys many sources that I can just sort of like understand how they believe and what they believe. I feel like the the meme of like you know some really like a siege f***ing person watching like one ContraPoints video and like saying oh you know what I was wrong. I think that is true for some people, but like I feel that if you have like strong conviction during your values no amount of watching content is going to change what you believe. Some people like if you go down one rabbit hole because that's what the algorithm does it shows you more stuff that you've already been watching. And I've seen like I've watched like one Voucher's video and like I get to like the list of these people who like are like on that site you know. When people say it is not possible it is possible for anyone to for that to happen. It is possible for me to like watch a bunch of videos and just transform my entire bro be just like that. I'm not saying I'm out of like such a thing, but I'm just saying that you should make sure that like you know what your conviction is during and why they are before you try to go outside and like try to do that. What about 4chan? Do you spend any time on you had mentioned pole and lefty pole? Are there any other boards that you look at or post on? Yeah I look at like a bunch of I look at like fit with like working out stuff and I look at the animals and nature board and also like fashion board. I look at like a bunch of different boards just for like the fun of it. Also like some of them they actually like I mean they improve you like if you actually use it the way you want. I've seen some copypasta that I've made myself and I've seen that come up on like 4chan once in a while. There was a copypasta that I made about like ab gale's Shapiro and I saw that come up on 4chan. I work from home mostly. There was like another mean just like that that said that guys will live like this. It was just like an empty room with like no like posters on and like there was just one like home gym setup and like a couch. I mean you'd have the couch but that was like wow that really is how I live. Let's say for example there's an event that happens in the world and you're interested to get the real story. What publication or social media site do you go to? What's the first thing that pops up in your mind? So it depends on like the kind of event. If it's something in the Middle East for example if it's a saw or something I would definitely go to RT media for sure. That's right. I would probably first go and see that and then I would go and see what the US media says and then I would see like what the Indian media says and then like I'll probably just go to YouTube and look up um gods, you're young and a style and like play it while I'm like looking at or something. That's what I would do. But I am like subscribe to the New York Times and like washing and post end wall street journal. I'm subscribed to all three of them. I hate the content but like my parents like it's so like I sometimes read like whatever they say. Politics is it's just one part of you you know it's like pretty much astrology. It's like it's just one part of your personality. The rest of it is just like how good you are with like the trends and how like hip you are being able to parody it and make fun of it in a way that like appeals to a larger audience. I wanted to ask you because you are obviously quite bright leaning but I imagine a lot of these spaces and the communities that you hang out in online are populated by people who are maybe explicitly white nationalist or at least leaning in that direction especially with the groipers and the America first kind of Fuentes extended universe. So I wanted to ask generally how much of your online communities are flooded with those types of people and if you experience any pushback from them. Oh yeah like I mean I'm good chat with like almost all who are all like siege. They like post like siege memes and stuff like that. They're mostly the pushback that I get is like ironic like oh dude you aren't you want entirely white you can't be here or something. There's only a small group of people who are who are genuinely that like low IQ to like you know just say dude okay dude you are not white you can really not be in this group chat or something. But most of it is they do believe that but like they are able to kind of delineate between what is like normal human interaction and what is like just borderline human interaction. There's also correlated with the fact that like you see a lot of people who are who kind of like are suspecting like they have a body dysmorphia or something. You see a lot of people posting hen-type pictures and they say oh this is me or something which is pretty much kind of dude are you okay. I think it's mostly just like marginalized communities like this online they find marginalized people which is why you see a lot of friends people or white nationalist. You see a lot of really questioning really inside the closet gay people who are in this community. You know so like my interactions with them and stuff they've been fine like especially those is one guy who like a few months ago told me dude I'm really sad. I think I'm grand or something. I don't know what to do and like I just told him just read it out and see like what you have in mind and he was fine you know so and this this was someone who used to post like he had to we have every single non-life who's living in this country like we have to go to their houses and like something or something and my interactions with them like when you talk to them like a normal person is that I mean they're normal in the interactions but they're not normal inside their head which is why they are drawn to such a community. I'm not sure what is first if they're drawn to this coming yeah and they become like that or like I would say that is probably the latter but like they were already like that and they are drawn to this community but my interaction with them have been okay but also like it is kind of kind of weird you know some people who like I've met online who I don't mind meeting in life in real life so like I don't mind like them falling like my main account and stuff like that but the way to put it is that I'm able to turn my URL friends into my IRL friends but I cannot I cannot influence my IRL friends to be able to accept my URL representation. Are you still making art even if you're not posting it online? I actually just want an art competition just like a month ago I mean I just don't post it online I just feel like I feel like when I was posting stuff I realized that I was just doing it just so like for the likes and stuff I do art for myself because I feel it makes me feel nice so that's why I still make art. I read like fiction so I read like Starship Poopers which I was really surprised at like how based it is you know and like I realized that the person who wrote that he was a miseride libertarian and like one thing that like I can say is that every time I do indulge myself in any fiction or something it is impossible for me to not take out my like interpretation of it from like a right wing standpoint or something or like a reactionary standpoint or any other whenever like I do engage with some media it is impossible for me to not look at it that way now. In 2016 I was like I take a political science class just around that time and then like I I knew about Bernie for a while but I didn't really see like any kind of kind of credence to like his causes till like that time I thought that what he represented was good you know I feel that a lot of people at least the way I was meeting people I saw that they were just initially not that into Bernie but in over time they became more in favor of him so like at that time I thought you know what it's decent to like you know he's a decent guy so I don't mind like supporting him. I'm mixed on like the police this year I'm like against like the police shooting people you know when I look at like the like the training stuff about the police I don't have anything against them like doing this but I do have against like what the police is like trained on so they should be trained much much better than what they're trained whatever hate the police is getting it's I think it's fair but also I don't think like protests should be allowed or like sanctioned by the state or something so overall my thing is that like I don't like Trump I never like Trump like even in 2016 I used to like you know find it funny whatever he's to do but like I he never really resonated with me either way I just hope like whatever wins I hope I am able to benefit out of that so I will just be looking as to what if suppose Trump wins which the ox I should invest in then if Biden wins what starts I should invest in then so that is mostly like my view on it I will say that like the Democrats are better you're getting like the environmental stuff this is to some extent but like other than that like I don't I don't really look at electoralism to like that lens what I would say like it's different now because of the coronavirus and everything is that people I think people's perception in one thing like tomorrow authoritarian government is going to go up in Japan and stuff like that you can already see that happening overall the reception to when authoritarian government is going to increase because of what we just experienced I don't know if it is god I don't know what it is but I'm still like thankful about them they're going to run out",

      "episode": "14 Jordan Peele.txt",
      "text": "Hello there this is Jonathan Watson and welcome to another edition of the podcast I like films. Now when I started doing this podcast one of the main reasons why I thought it might be fun was because I genuinely get a fill out of meeting filmmakers who's working spires and it pains me and top of my list probably was the guy I get to spend some time with today. Jordan Peel. Now I was already a fan of his comedy work as part of Key and Peel that I'd seen it's on American TV and I think I've been watching it on YouTube or somewhere but his first movie why that just came out of left film blew us all away. Get out was an amazing film. Now one of my favourite horror films of all time although I think it's diminishing it's somewhat even calling it a horror film because it's so much more than that beautifully performed but brilliantly written by Jordan brilliantly amazingly directed just a truly memorable movie which I think will stand the test of time as indeed will his new film us. The excitement that I felt going to see this in my whole family we went as a family so that's how we celebrate our family bonds going to see Jordan Peel movies. We rushed to see it and it was not just a great experience but rather like get out of the movie which I know will repay repeated viewings so here we are I'm chatting with Mr. Jordan Peel. A Jordan congratulations on us amazing I absolutely adore it. Thank you. Thank you. What a great film and you know it's by far and away not the norm that someone's second film after such a stunning debut you know has the same sort of level of impact and people enjoy it as much so they must have been I would have felt some fear when you when you set out to make your second movie. Yeah just whoo few that's good. Yeah some fear but you know what you return to this this this idea that if you make you know I have the opportunity to make my favorite film that doesn't exist so just do that and if you do it right if you do justice to that hopefully people will like it and if if not then you'll have time to go crawl up into a hole and was there was a position. I guess there was a chance when you set out to make it out that that might have been it you know that might not have been it and of course that so I guess you put the same kind of level of personal involvement into that you put it to us. I have a lot of images and nightmares running around in my brain so I feel like I'll have I'll be able to come up with something to at least have fun with but that really is it Jonathan it's if I'm having fun creating it then it is its own reward first of all and the audience tends to find that fun as you know that's kind of how how comedy works you know if I'm not over making it over analytical and I'm I'm truly having fun and making myself laugh and others will kind of get it. But I guess people do impose that level of not necessarily over analysis but there is analysis that goes into movies because us like it out there is there is there are metaphors involved there is a kind of a subtext there if you choose to poke and plot and and wake it up. Yeah that's right and for me the sort of social layers that that both these movies have in very different ways comes about by exploring something much more primal that comes from looking at my dreams and my ideas and ask myself why why is that what relevance does that have why is that coming out of me and so there's a little bit of this conversation with yourself you know ironically that kind of creates the this these films for me. And so the images are the kind of moments of nightmares thoughts ideas visions that came to you to lead you towards us without one giving away would that have been the idea of doppelgangers themselves itself you know that that as a concept I was that was the kind of like societal points that you're making with either kind of ideas that rose to the fund. The nugget as I call it for this film was the doppelganger one I used to picture I'm seeing myself on the opposite side of the subway but I'm a terrifying sight that would be Joanne. Yeah and I don't know what it is well you know I've now I've put good thought into what it is but I didn't know is it you know the fact that if you see yourself you you intrinsically know one of you must go you know there's only room for one that's the nature of the world you've been taught and if that doppelganger gives you a little creepy smile what do they know that I don't know. So the I think the the thing that catapulted me into making this movie and and and allow me to really understand that there was a doppelganger story I hadn't seen was this idea of the collective doppelganger what if you came across a family of doppelgangers wouldn't that be fun wouldn't that be interesting and horrifying for a whole new bunch of context and that that brought me towards the collective. I want to go on about the nugget the mother inspired get out but of course what a joy for the actors to get the chance to pride themselves as themselves but then also as the kind of slightly more knowing doppelganger version. I you know my favorite horror movies you know movies like The Shining and Misery and the Silence of the Lambs you know the the the thing that is scary is embedded in performance and so that is something that you know I've enjoyed in my first two films and I hope to continue is this idea that you know let the acting be scary you know I I come to a movie to see acting and to watch that that craft everything is in support look if you've got if you've got a can I curse here yeah please do you have a shitty looking film but the acting is amazing you've got a good film yeah and if you have the opposite if you've got amazing looking film but with crappy performances it doesn't work. But surely the key to all this though is that both of those things will fall if the script isn't any good. Yes yes the script has to be good I mean that was the the Hitchcock proverb or whatever is three things you need to make a good movie script script script and it is true if the blueprint is there then you know that's the height that you can push the chance of the chance. It stands a chance. Performance wise though I don't think I've ever seen Lupita deliver such a remarkable performance I mean really truly and I know people are already talking as they do and speculating and it's like you were taking away about a wall to switch it all along way up but just a tremendous performance for me. It is it is she you know first of all had a task that you don't come across very often as you're as you're noting it in these two roles and and two roles with you know the three-dimensional roles you know I would I would joke from with her I was like I need I need I need you to be the Karee Starling and the Hannibal actor in this movie you know which you know to sort of you know jokingly put the pressure on but she she just she delivered and she went to you know such depth in how she thought about these roles their connection between the two of them but also the different worlds that they're from and and it was when she came on set as red the villain I mean you could feel the air gets sucked out of the room and it was like we were in the presence of evil. Well and all four of the the doppelganger family played both roles brilliantly I thought I thought the young girl she was truly chilling but Winston who kind of like in a way it's slightly tougher because of course the if we can use it from the the real Winston yeah is so broadly comic in a way and wonderfully comic and then but then he has to be kind of guttural and animalistic in his doppelganger form so more of a contrast there. Yeah I think you know with Abraham the the the the the the the quote-unquote shadow version of of Gabe Winston's Winston's other character you know we've sort of exploring the Michael Myers archetype there's almost a childlike curiosity to that the type of psychopath he is and he brought great empathy to the character you know he didn't put past judgment on either of his characters he didn't go think of Abraham as the evil one or anything like that he did the work to connect to both of them which is which is crucial for us to when you get to the end of the movie for the kind of reveals and the fun there you know the obviously you're writing the script but the kind of foreshadowing that occurs both in this end get out early on there are little key moments that repay revisiting these films you look at them again and that's why I'm very keen to see us again but I wonder is that something that occurs you is that in the early stages of writing you're thinking I'll put a little marker here which will make more sense when they are aware of this or is it something that you kind of like plumb back in when you got to the end well you know there's all sorts of levels you can sort of promote this rewatchability you know to sort of take you behind the curtain a little bit one is just on the this the level of the Easter egg of realizing there's little bits in here if you're paying attention that you can pick up another device I use is sort of episodic quality and this is kind of a little bit more of the esoteric secret of mine is is you know movies that have a feeling like that they have a certain motion and that you enter new phases of the movie both visually and thematically and plot-wise you know allow you to just promote rewatchability I always rewatch films that have clear sections to them and you almost you're not but not just in the kind of classic three acts more like actually kind of tonal ships uh yes yes and I work with a four act structure generally is how I think about it but yes a new a new location in the in my sort of past the midpoint will um you know make sort of fulfill the adventure in the journey you know the Star Wars movies does this than a great way you're you're visiting three or four different planets and the rewatchability is immense uh speaking stars are you tempted by science fishing so at the moment now we think of you and it seems I mean I think people are always strange when someone from comedy goes into something which is dark they assume comedy will lead to comedy and of course there is comedy in your films but I think there was some surprise when people said oh this guy you know KMP and he's doing this this grim kind of like a dystopian uh social horror movie um there's ways that but are you tempted to what do you want to stay now that you are I guess you have a kind of brand name in a way so that's exploitable or do you want to expand into the other kind of genres which you love to the child uh no I I'm I'm I'm pretty firmly in this horror or horror adjacent style and I'm I'm my favorite horror movie maybe alien and um you know as you as you'll you know with these films there's they are they hit they hit a science fiction note as well there is there are there is a piece of that I'm I love where science fiction and horror can interact because there's something special that happens when you try to apply science to you know whatever you want to call it magic or or the soul or religion the the two ideas are incompatible and a very monstrous way mankind tempering where they yeah man and woman kind yes that's right yeah um uh that there's a um that you know it's one of these great great all-time um the dances between science and and religion and and where you can um usually in in the in the horror setting where they intersect is is in as an abomination yeah and and that is cool you mentioned the nugget that kind of uh the doppelganger idea the king pivis was it what was the nugget forget out if there was one uh the nugget forget out was you know I had this dream once I was going through a bank lobby of a bank and I was passing through but bustling group of people I turned the corner to the elevator area and all of the wallah of the people went silent at once and I sort of creeped around and looked back at the lobby I just walked through and all the people were standing there looking at me and this this immense feeling you know what I I call it the the stomach just dropping out of my my ass um that this primal feeling and and sort of and that started me off on this you know understanding that the fear that I was going to exploit in this movie would be um the fear of unwanted attention it's fairly universal even even for us who tend to get in front of a camera who's who's seek it out for whatever be psychological flaws that they've been to do yeah yeah that amazing film of course I was talking to Daniel Clua get a little bit briefly and I went to a screening here in the UK and it was a screen that'd been set up for him for his friends and he even I'm not really a friend of his I'd like to be but I I don't think I know that well he let us go along to it and it was interesting seeing it with an audience predominantly people of color very different reaction I think then we've got from a white audience in the UK just in terms of some of the beats some of the jokes some of the ideas that were picked up there and I understand that you initially were you of casting Daniel because the experience of being a black man in the UK you feel it might be quite a very different one being a black guy in the US could you expand on that for me yeah I mean first of all Daniel Clua is my probably my favorite actor in existence I found him through that the black mirror episode that he just absolutely 30 million million million amazing and amazing performance from him is incredible so I knew he had um what it was needed in terms of being able to commit to both sides of this journey both the the restraint and then the passionate thing but yeah I you know I I also didn't know how much of what I was exploring was the African American experience and in my early conversations with him he said no nope that's all that's it you know I mean because obviously it works really but I was speaking to there was a young woman sitting next to the screening afterwards and I raised this point then asked her a pin and she said yes she said I think it is different it is different being a black in the UK she sent to being a black woman in America that was her yeah which is you know totally fascinating to me and and and I believe it I I I would imagine that there was a course commonality in the sense of being the other or the minority um but of course you know you know that what I can speak intelligently to extend about the states you know this the history of the states that is you know slavery the evolution of the civil rights movement it's a loaded loaded loaded history and so you know I'm sure you'll notice from outside at least the the dynamic right now is we're victims of the the generational trauma and that and so many of the you know atrocious forms of racism that used to exist still exist but in different ways and with a different mask on so there's a little bit of a a scar tissue in terms of race that you know I don't know if we'll ever get past I mean it's interesting because to an extent you can see even in Aster's you can interpret the metaphor to an extent to be I mean it's kind of about oppressed people or people who have fewer vagues in life it's kind of and you could see that as a kind of race metaphor as well of course um but I guess it would be wrong and it would be something I I imagine that you would like to avoid to be categorized as the black horror film director or to be someone whose films always speak about that subject even if one has to de-try it yeah you know I you know I don't mind being called the black horror director it's it's it's true dammit um but but I but I did want to make this movie not about race because I didn't want to be pigeonholed is that I've I've I only make horror films about one thing I and I really said a lot of what I I needed to say about race with with with get out so this one is is um you know it's about it's about the United States it's about it's about however however the you define us the word us I think it can apply to any number of factions that uh you know you you just need to have there just needs to be a them and that's what we're talking about is that intrinsically in the the familial and and the tribalism of humanity is a sense of the other and the invader and I guess in a way I I know you said before the screening movie last night it's sort of a worse such test in that you know how you interpret it because I came out feeling I was one of the the shadows and I was proud of that and I was telling my family you guys don't know how lucky you had it yeah because I come from the I come from that sewer yes I remember that rabbit yes so now our word from our sponsors and it's 23 and me they are offering you a health and ancestry DNA kit in which you do a small test at home send it off to them and they will send you a report on your health your traits your ancestry and more for example you may well have a genetic variant that is common among elite power athletes I'm pretty certain I don't have that you might be lucky enough to have that because studies have found that almost all elite power athletes including sprinters, flours and jumpers have a specific genetic variant in a gene related to muscle composition if you'd like to find out whether you possibly have that do the 23 and me health and ancestry kit send it in when you get your reports back you can load it over your friends saying that within you lies the potential to be a super athlete even if you probably choose not to exercise enough to fully realize that potential that's down to you that's nothing to do with me or them but we're offering you that chance so by your 23 and me health and ancestry kit today go to 23andme.com slash films that's 23andme 2.3 and me.com slash films my wife and I did it we had quite a lot of fun because to do the test you produce a lot of uh flame I suppose is the word from your mouth and you put it into a chest tube so we'll set around a table coughing up into test tubes which kind of became a weirdly perverse kind of competition as to who could get the most in the quickest I think I probably came last you can buy your 23andme health and ancestry kit today go to 23andme.com slash films so that's the number two the number three the words and me.com slash films you'll get 25 pounds off your health and ancestry service kit through to the first of April thank you later I wanted to make a monster movie and in the great monster movies um you know our an exploration of fear but also with an empathy you know there's often you know the Frankenstein you know you look at the the classic universal monsters well even you mentioned even even Michael Myers there's a kind of number where you feel some empathy some yes yeah well okay then yeah you jump to the the 80s as well as you know when you got even you know I mean there's no empathy for Freddy Krueger there is a you know we we begin to relate to Freddy Krueger more than the victims I'm sorry no we enjoy who's but then that's because he's killing Johnny Depp and who doesn't want to say that happened and he's doing jokes about it you know exactly he was the he was the character we love you mentioned um we're talking about Daniel in 30 million merits and of course Black Mirror Springs to mind is an amazing piece of anthology fiction with similar themes so that you explore perhaps and now you're in charge of Twilight Zone yes which is so exciting although I went to look back at some Twilight Zone's advances because I remember loving it as a kid most of them were terrible I mean most of them are pretty bad I I I cannot confidently back up your assertion as someone who is in charge of continuing the great tradition of of Surling understood but I can say that the the the ones that we think about are the the really great ones is five maybe I didn't even remember you look at the right now at 20,000 feet or something that suit that wouldn't get that wouldn't get you through the door these days that was you know I I I I disagree I disagree I think I mean come on it's it's there is a primal tension and suspense and a relatable I mean it is exploiting our fear of of flight we all have that you see the men's love of souls okay okay the production value you have to put yourself back in the time and and and and all that yes I a great story a great teleplay so it was a maths someone that was that one of which in maths songs well I'm not sure but let's say yes yeah yeah I think you know a part of what has become the legacy of that is there's a catch value in retrospect yeah and there always was this sort of surling wink that is you know unique from the the Charlie Brookers wink which is which Charlie's has been perhaps unfairly categorized as far dark as soul then Shirley had a levity didn't he of course yes and and I don't you know I don't know that that's true I find that there's a levity with with Charlie's work and and by the way I think it's one of the greatest shows of all time in black mirror but yes there there was a the project of the Twilight Zone was to you know sometimes it would be based on you know the the thing would amount to a like a dad pun you know to serve man it's yeah there there there is a a fun and a whimsy that is in Twilight Zone where black mirror there's a satire and a a gut punch yeah right they get compared often for obvious reasons and science fiction anthology you know I think with Twilight Zone you know one way we're helping define what makes a Twilight Zone Twilight Zone is we're sort of leaving the technological exploration to Charlie's world which is more she's nailing it's more about humanity it's it's more about a society and will you be doing the intrals will you be standing in a slightly uncomfortably shot by like selling always well yeah cigarette in hand ideally and doing the yeah everything but the cigarette I'm I'm that it's it's that's a shame though because you look at now it's such a moment you're just got a cigarette in time all the time it's such a different time yeah I gave up smoking over a decade ago so I um that the very least I'm not up there fidgeting meeting one so you've written any of the script so far how many are you going to be in charge of presumably you have a team working with you yes yes I'm just staying with it it would be disingenuous to claim I'm serving all of the roles that Sirling did with uh with with the Twilight Zone I have a great team of producers um with me I'm working with Simon Kinberg a win Rosenfeld and Audrey Chong and we have the episodes have all been written we have a stable of writers how many have you written how many have you got ten wow ten that's the whole first season ten that's that's the first season yeah um it's it it comes out April April first this year this year man so you started shooting I guess oh we shot we shot this year the in like in about three weeks you finished well amazing yeah and so I can't wait for this this is going to be on CBS in the States CBS all access and so over here we can get it online I guess or you'll have to check your localist I'm very excited about that I really am and presumably this was growing up because you would have been I mean I was too young to see it first time we went out really so I could so you wouldn't have seen it first time was there an equivalent amazing story I guess Spielberg that was on when you were killing us wouldn't it yeah amazing stories that was a great one for me I mean I remember the the one Spielberg directed with play the World War II playing in the cartoon wheels that come at the end spoiler alert of course he directed an episode of Night Gallery okay I haven't seen it for what Sirling yeah I think it was his first TV director and Night Gallery was even worse than Twilight Zone it has to be said even though it's it's kind of great yeah and kind of all for the same time and you know but that episode directed by Spielberg is the one we've done quorfering okay I have no idea this is you've out nerd me I've got the box set I'll send out because my wife if I threatened to put Night Gallery on she threatens to leave me immediately she I made her watch it one the first one with Rodney McDowell in is hilariously over the top and ridiculous but Night Gallery was great as well so this is um but it's this is an interesting point the fact that they've given a black American creator authorship of what is a very mainstream show in this way I think it's a kind of it seems to me in a way this is more of an interesting turning point than other points in your life yeah well you know in the genre you know I wanted to put a black family at the center of a horror film I'd never seen that yeah yeah um so this is yeah we're in a very encouraging time for a black authors for black directors for black actors um in the industry you know like you noted there's the myth that there is greater risk you know both domestically and internationally with black films is is gone in this post-wokandan age yeah yeah that's right and and and now that we know Wakanda exists we now we know we need there's no going back that for Brianium we'll set us free exactly um the music I love the score I was listening to some of the tracks about I was familiar with some of the modern tracks you have on it I'm not sure who what the incidental music for us for you um the composer is Michael Able so that's seen without giving this is not a spoiler but as I've seen there's a shot fairly early which is it's an aerial shot from above on the beach and there's a beautiful percussive piece of memory was that by that's by him that's him yeah that's amazing isn't that great and and and he is a he did get out for me as well he's he's a real master at pinpointing new sounds a new new sort of genres of horror music and and that's why I was that track they do in the car the one something five lute lunis okay because that is a very clear sound a very very clean sound I don't know if that's a version that you you use for it but once again it struck me that he's picked out some of the kind techniques of that almost for his score so yes yes so we we sort of kind of continue with this this idea of creating the horror deconstruction of I got five on it which is you know it's a bay area anthem not about drugs so it's probably about drugs don't do drugs in the scene that you're referencing later in the movie where that comes back it was originally this chakowsky so you know it kind of as you know it coordinates with this ballet performance a bit and I just didn't feel like it was working and and so that song the I got five on it always has this angelo bell de mentee ask you know nightmare on elm street plastics let you off kill to me yeah something wrong about it yeah and at the same time it's it's such a dope groove I got five on it nothing with that in no way I got five on it it's gonna be stuck and I'm so bad I got five on it I take sex to the face whatever so we turn that up a notch and sort of it's an amazing moment you the way the impact on the audience is very interesting because everyone who knew the song he reacted immediately very viscally to it and everyone else you know it took me a second or two to understand kind of what I thought you were trying to do there because I hadn't heard that before right right right all that and that's that's um that's cool that having sort of experiencing that that song for the first time it's still stuck enough to oh yeah to kick in but I need to watch about the poster amazing visual in the poster I'm someone who tends to pop perhaps my age and it's that terrible mix of nostalgia and I'm wanting to tell people that that life was better back then but but I love the old kind of like 80s and 70s painted posters yeah but you somehow managed even though it's a photo art poster you managed to capture that feeling in the design are you you hands on with that level of the marketing uh yeah fairly hands hands on um I've got a good uh dialogue going with uh the marketing uh of the film because you know I mean quite frankly these these movies that that I make are all about reveal and so there's a very important line to respect in terms of how to feed an audience's imagination as opposed to giving them the film if you're talking about the the film with the mask yeah yeah I did not design that that was that was not my idea that that came from the marketing department and uh it's a beautiful beautiful image really so you were behind over the scissors yes when I when I came in first pitched the film I told them my vision for that that scissors poster you know because just give them give them a little bit yeah give them give them enough to understand where the what the aesthetic of the horror might like yeah yeah but it's great the way they brought that into for the Fangoria Cup watchbook they just use the top half yeah and then you have to put the bottom half to get the full effect that's right that's right yeah it's like a mad pull a white yeah the Fangoria issue is very exciting to me yeah because you are presumably when you're a kid that would be in a big thing to you Fangoria yeah as you pointed out these the posters and images from horror movies I was able to see those before I was allowed to actually see the movies which it's almost worse yeah because I again what you don't know is what terrifies you yeah um the nightmare and elm street poster I remember for years just gave me nightmares yeah and you never got yeah and you wouldn't have been able to see that film of course well so I guess your pre-video as well on your old video around did hung video when you were kid did you have one the beta max and vHS started when I was around five oh so you're lucky yeah see I I I exist in that golden age before that so really you would just see a maybe someone had an eight millimeter camera and you can see a 30 second of a movie like the blob that was what we had John wow that was it you just when I had to go to say I'm from the shadow I want to say really yeah yeah we didn't even have you're from the underpass I'm completely I'm below I'm the level below that we didn't even have webics oh Jordan thank you so much I was huge fan I can't wait to see us again because I watch to get out about five or six times I watched it again recently and even now I'm finding new things and I think I didn't notice that before yeah so I love the way you hide stuff I love the the kind of textures that you put within it I can't wait to enjoy us in the same way and it's going to be huge so continue to success to you and thank you so much for the films appreciate that thank you great so that was the time we had to spend chatting I could have gone on for hours I'm sure I would have enjoyed it I suspect he would have done so slightly less but I'm sure we'll get a catch up again sometime us is out on the 22nd everywhere please please please do go and see it it's an amazing piece of work and it boasts a performance from Lupita Nyeungo which is just I think one of the very best you will see all year an incredible film an incredible director if you enjoyed the podcast and please tell your friends and make sure that if you haven't until already you subscribe thank you who's Jason Jason where were you I didn't know if you were lost stick with me I'll keep you safe there's a family I drive away it's probably the neighbors which I'll scare the family I can I help you Zora

      "text": "Okay, we're synced and everything. Okay, God, I'm horribly nervous. I'm really bad at this. Oh, me too. I studied photography and I have no idea what I'm doing. You seem like you know what you're doing. Because we edit the shit out of these because I fucked up every five minutes. Tim Heidecker, welcome to the podcast. Thank you so much. You had one of my favorite artists on the show, Adam Curtis. Yeah, I was going to bring up Adam Curtis. What's your favorite Adam Curtis movie? I mean, I think hypernormalization and... It's good. I think bitter Lake and then hypernormal. Those two like bitter Lake sets you up with other understanding, you know, the history of post-war, post-World War II, this how the world got restructured. Yeah. And what how power works beautifully made. He's a beautiful artist, sort of first and foremost maybe. In hypernormalization, you get this theory that he presents, which I think is like the world has gotten so complicated. The actual way the world works has gotten so complicated that the people in charge have kind of lost the ability to really control it anymore. No one really knows how anything works. And therefore we're just going to distract people and present a sort of mirage of what happiness should be or what the future should be. And it's this challenge or this kind of throwing out this idea that we've lost the ability to present a few, an idea for the future or what the future, what we should even be aspiring towards. And there's a great scene in that movie where Patty Smith is walking around downtown New York. And downtown New York at that time had been kind of decimated and it was just, you know, bombed out or just burned out buildings and graffiti everywhere and things falling apart. And she's walking around and not to single her out. This was a whole movement that is still going on today. But it's sort of look at the beautiful detritus of this building. Look how cool this is. You know, look how graffiti it's like so fucking, you know, so like cool, you know. And it's like, oh, we got sold this idea that like these crumbling ruins are actually cool. And this is what's real. We shouldn't try to make this a better place, you know. And my parents were growing up. They had the Jetsons and they had the idea of flying cars and, you know, like, yeah, yeah, living on other planets and traveling around the solar system. And like, I think that a lot of that has gotten stolen away or just whittled away or and that's kind of, you know, I don't know. I don't do much to do this, but it is like, Adam Curtis's movie, hypernormalization really put that in my head of like, why I don't see anybody running for, I don't see anybody trying to present a vision for the future that is in any way interesting or exciting to me. Right. You know, right. Yeah, if I recall correctly, so I teach in an MFA program and in the fall at the end of the semester, I think it was right after the election actually coincidentally. We rewatched during the break, you have it, two week break. And the origin of hypernormalization as a word, it comes from the end of the Soviet Union. Yeah. When the society and the state were so dysfunctional, but everyone had to kind of pretend that it was still working. Yeah, yeah. And so you go through the motions, but you know that the society you're in now is in irreparable decline. Sure. Feels rather similar. Yeah, I mean, it's, you know, it's a, it's a, all we see now are marrages and, and obviously you can, AIs and deep fakes and all that stuff is a whole other level to it. But, you know, take, there's a million examples. But I don't know how many days do you wake up and look at the news and read about some kind of ceasefire or some kind of agreement or some kind of kabuki theater of people pretending that things are happening. When the next day, there's some kind of drone strike that takes out a building. You know, you're like, what is any of this? Does anybody know what the hell's going on? It's all just kind of seemingly like pretend time. Yeah. And while the folks with the most are kind of just, you know, hiding, squirreling away their, you know, their fortunes or making plans to head to New Zealand or whatever. And their bucket is way out. Yeah. I am. You did a Trump album as well. I wanted to ask you, how do you choose these figures that you're going to parody? Well, I have a big board with a bunch of headshots and I study them carefully. I don't know. I mean, obviously I respect the question. I'm sorry to be dismissive of it. There are just certain people that either bother me or I find fascinating that I have some friends like Vic Berger or Greg Torkington or people. They're, you know, we share these people on through text messages or through conversations. Did you see this guy? You know, this, whoever it is, you know, and there's just people are fascinating to me and some are interesting. I mean, and it's usually just like I did on that Trump album. I did a song called Wilbur Ross and Wilbur Ross was a guy that fascinated me because he was, and he looked like he looked really funny because he was this, looked like a turtle. You know, he was very old. He just looked like a villain, you know, and he was a villain. He would go and like buy, I think he bought Bethlehem steel where we grew up and shut her down. He was one of those guys that would come in and vampire capitalist kind of guy. And he had a quote, there was a quote about him having these monograms, $500 slippers that he wore all the time. Okay. Yeah. Okay. And I, those things get in my head and I sit down and I write, Wilbur Ross puts a slippers on $500 at a time just like the rest of, you know, like that just became an interesting way to look at these people to me. And so it just, yeah, it's hard to say what triggers those things with me or what sparks them. I should say triggers. I'm not triggered by anything. Be careful. Be careful about that one. Not triggered by anything. Yeah. Well, it's a product of long debates now, not to be too snooty about this, but there's a big conflict in museum culture, de-assessioning things from the canon because the history of art is Eurocentric. And so in some cases, there's a scarce amount of resources and people have debates about, well, we have, you know, we have a hundred monays. Can we sell one of them and buy some other stuff? Yeah. So these are, yeah, these are. I mean, I'm open to all kinds of discussion about this stuff, but just know you pull a thread. It's going to, you know, it's going to unravel and that could be fine, you know? Like, like I was, I was all for taking down statues of, you know, heroes of the south, of the civil war because it's sort of like, well, what, this is a monument. And the idea that this is a part, this is a way to learn history is bullshit. You could read a book about that. The daughters of the Confederacy that put up those specific points. Yeah, that was, I mean, that was like what, like, 30 years ago. Yeah, it was, you know, as a reaction to the civil rights movement. So that's the, I made a joke. It's like, you used to have statues so you could literally see what these people looked like. You know, because there wasn't photographs. Yeah, there wasn't books that had, you know, so it's like, yeah, you don't need these statues. But that's an extreme example. But that's interesting about museums. I mean, how many, how many natural history museums or world history museums are full of just stolen artifacts or just... It's a fresh, huge conversation. Really, yeah. I don't know. Do we need this? Can we just like, why do you need zoos? Can we have picture 3D models of orangutans and put, you know, like, I'm, like, that's the kind of Adam Curtis idea of presenting a radical vision for the future that so much of our daily life is just rooted in 18th, 19th, 20th century ideas of how to live and how we structure society and any place where we can break some of those models is, I'm open to that, for sure. What did you say about the tariffs on the movie industry? Oh, yeah. That's probably going to go away. How is that going to work precisely? Well, I don't know. It doesn't make any sense. And, you know, again, I'm not any kind of expert on any of this stuff. So, like, please understand. I don't know what I'm talking about. I don't, I've asked a few people who are in like the movie business of like, does that mean they have to build a Tokyo set in California? Or like, what, how does this, like, what if it gets distributed from France? No, no one films festival. And John Voitz got it under control. Oh, yes. Okay. He'll tell you'll see, you'll see the document soon. A while ago, someone sent you a package of phallum gum. Of what? Phallum gum. Phallum gum. Yeah, you remember this very hard gum? Yeah. Is that you? I don't know who it was. I was going to ask if you remembered because I think it was somebody from our discord. Okay. It was like a flavorless gum. Yes, hard, elastic gum tastes like plants. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And they use it for like, muing for building up your jaw muscles. Right. Yeah. Do you remember who no one would cop to it? I don't remember who it was. I'm sure somebody on my team does. Could you, yeah, could you find the address? Yeah. Reverse, trust me. Yeah. I can look, I'll look into that for you. Are you now or have you ever been a member of the Democratic Socialist of America? You know, it's on my Wikipedia. I think. Yes. I, uh, in the early days of the Trump administration, I was supportive of the DSA and went to a couple meetings. I know. I think I joined. I don't know. I feel very much like I'm in front of what's his name? McCarthy. I'm going to get expelled from the country. I like a lot of what they do. I didn't really get to involved. You know, I just thought, well, this is, I like their, I like what they're doing on a, on a local grassroots level and communities and they do a lot of great community service and, um, you know, I'm sure there are things I would disagree with them about. Uh, but they're organizing and their general approach to how to try to structure a more equitable society is in line with the what, what I think. I think we would each agree that we need some type of organizational structure outside of the democratic party proper. Yeah. Well, yeah, or like reform that party in the way that Trump reformed the Republican party. Yes. Yes. You know, clear, clear, uh, clear. Why is that take so unpopular right now? To stay within the democratic party, but reform it or re, rebrand or rebuild it in a different way. Like the, the Republicans were these free market evangelists, right? That was uncompromising like Chicago School economics. You couldn't violate those rules. And then this like wrecking ball guy comes in all the sudden, their economic protectionists, their non interventionist isolationists. Yeah. Like, they, and they fucking cause play as him even. Yeah. Like he just totally reoriented their priorities. Well, I mean, same institution. And this is a thing that happened with the Democrats. Potentially could because you, I don't think you could have predicted that it would happen to the Republicans. I think if you, I don't know that much about this, but I think Republicans are a bit more disciplined when it comes to getting under the falling in line. Sure. You know, and the democratic party maybe just to diverse in terms of the types of people that fall under that tent. And Trump is a once in a, is a thousand year flood sort of personality, I think. Right. You know, I don't know if we're probably just a luck of the draw that we don't have somebody that cares, Matt, and, and, you know, this perfect storm sort of guy. Yeah. I mean, well, we, we did have someone that cares, Matt, and they, organized every, yeah, Bernie. Bernie. Yeah. The rest of the world to shut him down. Yeah, but he was, I think he was too small. To, to, he had never shelted. Ideas, it is in credit. But yeah, and just didn't have the, the money and probably the, I don't know, that's good. He could have been, but I mean, we had Obama, but that was very like, yeah, the surface level stuff. Hope and change and things that were not very structural. They were kind of like just aspirational good vibes kind of thing, which I bought into. I mean, I was like excited about that. No, we all believe in that. And then you saw the results of that, and it was kind of like, oh, that didn't really amount to much. Yeah. Can we spend a moment on the environment that you grew up in? Yeah. Because there has been this kind of drift in mainstream culture. So let's talk about maybe the home, the environment that you grew up in, and then like some of these early creative and particularly music scenes where people get introduced to a lot of politics. You can tell us a bit about your background. I went to school in Philadelphia, and there was a very vibrant punk, DIY. Yeah, yeah. You know, verging on communist kind of subculture there. Yeah.

      "text": "Welcome back to the podcast. In this episode I'm speaking with Dr. Nadim Saman, who is a curator at KW Institute for Contemporary Art in Berlin. He is the author of a newly published book called Poetics of Encryption, Art and the Technocene that is out now from publishers Hatshakhans. I'll put a link in the description for this episode. Longtime listeners may recognize Nadim as a returning guest to the podcast. Our previous episode was out only on the pay walled feed. At that time we were discussing a digital exhibition at KW titled Open Secret that included many friends of the stream like new models, Rachel Rossin, Eva and Franco Mates among many others. The book we're talking about today contains a familiar cohort of artists. John Raffman, Trevor Paglin, Simon Denny, Brit-A-Tie, American artist, Hito Steril, Zach Blass, Chimpham, Ed Fornielis, my old D&D partner on the Twitch stream, and Brad Tramel, my longtime collaborator, among numerous others. It's a tour de force of the past ten years of art, looking at how technology and the internet are changing our society. The book is around 25% art and 75% text written by Nadim, so it really feels like the work and the essays are co-producing this idea of the technocene, which Nadim characterizes as quote, the overwhelming prevalence of technology in all corners of life and death, such that it becomes the subject of a cultural reckoning. He continues on, in the context of a poetics of encryption, the term technocene fixes upon the open experience of temporality that is generated by a landscape of black sites, black boxes, and black holes. These go on to include cryogenic freezing for life extension, the resurrection of prehistoric animals, ancient viruses revived in high-tech laboratories, zombie social media profiles, a return to archaic religious affect in the presence of consumer electronics and the rise of powerful AI. This project culminates in a massive exhibition to take place in February of 2024 at KW Institute of Contemporary Art in Berlin. I'll hand it over to Nadim in a moment, but before I sign off for this intro, I want to leave you with a final quote from the book. He writes, Much new art registers a growing understanding that the mediating masks of tech do not end with the screen's edge. They are prevalent everywhere else too, occupying an expanded field without limit and have become the ideological astroturf upon which any politics must walk. I hope you enjoy the episode. This is Dr. Nadim Saman. This book is really to reflection on the last ten years of my artistic engagements in Berlin. I had a project based for seven years called Import Project and I started it when I first moved to the city and that was around in 2012 when I started that. At the time, you know, the post-internet scene was extremely vibrant in Berlin. It still wasn't a dirty word yet. And I was very interested in joining a conversation about how artists relate to emerging technology. In my view, it was the broader question than what is a post-internet style or not. It's really about how is technology changing our life from politics and our economic due to our sex lives. And I think that that is a concern that just lives on today. Whether or not anyone picks the term for internet-captured, it's just a live issue. How is digital change and emerging technology reordering all of our lives and the cultural sphere? In general, people talk about computation almost in the middle of every transaction. Well, technology is almost in the middle of every relationship we have today. And the thing about that is it changes the sort of the temporal dynamics that we experience. So I think that our place in time is unsettled at the moment. You can scan an ancient statuary, you can create a data set at a prehistoric artifacts and you can have, you know, again, an AI generate speculative cultural patrimony. You can map the human genome and you can work on bespoke gene in CRISPR, viruses that were lying dormant under the ice and hour release. So whether it's scrambling of space and time that goes with digital change and with that in mind, the experience of the present is totally different. It's really hard to understand what that moment is. And I think that's what the technology is. It's a major scrambling about place in time. This book in a way crystallizes this turn toward pessimism after the Snowden revelations after WikiLeaks. This book is really about the crypt in encryption. That is to say like a spatial imaginary, you know, the inside of hidden technology. And if you can't access that inside, like if you don't have the key to unlock, so like, you know, look under the hood, then you still have to deal with it. And so there's a lot of analogy that goes on that a lot of translation. And there's a lot of like psychological bargaining wherein we like to think of ourselves as scientifically minded, enlightened and so on. And we understand that these things were created by people. So they are on principle, understandable, but in practice, they're not. And so there's this tension between between the science fiction of our scientism and the daily relation, which is much more close to the faith and all these more arcade structures. And so we tell ourselves stories about what our relationship is to the tech. Obviously the word enlightenment, it has within it the light that comes from Plato's allegory of the cave, you know, the enlightened as it were, one to see the truth, the ones who can like look at the sun, the unenlightened are the ones, you know, who look at shadows and take them as the thing that they are the shadows are. There's something in between them and the truth, the slaves in the cave only deal with the mediation. Well, I think, funnily enough, Silicon Valley's been telling us that the world is opening up, everything's getting more transparent, information is at our fingertips. But I think that we're living in a proliferating landscape of black boxes. And so we have this kind of counter movement. So much of tech is occluded, it's unavailable. So I use these three metaphors or images that, you know, are ways to look at different artists work. So the first is black site, you know, that from like CIA rendition programs, to feel yourself unable to escape tracking, made a capture, all those sorts of things that are really like prevalent in the politics of privacy, on the flip side of the black site being locked in, there's being locked out. Now being locked out, that's the black box. And then the third one, I use the third section of third metaphor is black hole. That's when concepts of inside and outside, they're all scrambled. Definitions get stretched. The idea of the black hole as a metaphor for super dense computational prosody or super dense digital archive. You may take in the whole archive in the course of your lifetime, there's more to read than you could ever, than you have out in the day. The parameters in one of these large, huge AI models, there's trillions of parameters, you know, for like GPT-4 and so on. So all you can do is look at how they warp cultural space time around them. The distortion that happened around these super dense sort of digital beings. But I think that all these distortions of like identity and like meaning, that's what occurs around the super dense digital agent. I think artists are creating artwork that sort of express exemplary distortion. And they're all kind of like new senses for the contemporary age. They're all strange, new chimera that ask a riddle, you know, a riddle something like how can we live with it? In these analogies, the character is being distracted by the shadows within the cave, right? There's this idea that eventually you could find the sun, you can crawl out, you can emerge into this clear understanding of the actual world. But you describe that the techno scene is this period of eclipse. Maybe this complex stack multifaceted levels of alienation that comprise contemporary life of vastly complicated communications technologies that are too dense for the rational human mind to understand that clarity has been obscured in some sense. I was very fascinated by that choice of metaphor because in eclipse in itself is it's temporary. And you do say explicitly in the book that the techno scene, as you understand it, is not the end of history that that there is conceivably something that comes after. When does this period end? What would once again restore those conditions to have rationality to understand the world in which we exist without, you know, the need for this kind of conspiracy and folkloric understanding of these complex technologies? I can't say that I have the answer for that. I mean, I think that this book is really, it's a diagnosis. But I do say that these exemplary chimeras, they're, you know, and I literally think about migratumose structures of Sphinx. I think about Eva and Sanca wonderful panorama cat, which is a hexadermine cat, but I think it has eight legs. And that cat is the kind of one to one three dimensional physicalization of a glitch that you'd have when the panorama function on your camera stretches your photo of your health cat to kind of surreal proportions with multiple legs. I mean, what they've done is they've sort of shown how the the dataification of the world, because about distortions, cats are great, you know, the cats are also the, you know, they are like the core meme, right? And they're domestic gods. Cats are, they're like the feral at home. They watch over domestic space in a certain sense. And they're, and their Sphinx is two. The Sphinx is a cat. So the idea, at least, this is what I'm heading with, at least, you know, some of my view of some of the work in the life factor, you know, spending time with these cryptids, these chimeras, try to figure out what they're asking, you know, asking about us. Because you know, the riddle of the Sphinx classically is, you know, what goes on four legs in the morning and the two legs in the afternoon. And, you know, and it's a man, a human, you know, crawling as a baby on four legs, standing as a, you know, mature physical specimen, you know, in the prime of your youth. And then, you know, in your old age, with a cane, can we answer the same thing today when they ask, you know, question of us, you know, what are we, what are we to make of ourselves today? Maybe that's not the answer. So I think that they're all kind of, they're suggestive totems perhaps, who maybe even a new religion. You know, artists like Nora Albadry talk about speculative cultural heritage and sort of generative deities. And you hear that outside of art too. I think that there's something in that. I'm not sure where it's going, but I see it in the art. There's something that happens in this complex network of systems where you're in search of conspiracy, you're kind of migrating through these different networks, you're exploring different corners of, you know, dark recesses of the internet. And it actually produces the cryptids and the conspiracies that people were searching for in the first place, right? So the idea that the kind of panorama cat of this glitch that could be created by just moving your phone, capturing an image of your house is then made real through this technology. It kind of sets off the self-fulfilling cycle, the system is too complex. It can only be understood through conspiracy and folklore. And then you look deeper into the system to try and gain clarity. And then you find the artifacts of conspiracy and folklore. So in some cases, that is very literal in the book where we might say, you know, Trevor Paglins pieces of looking at covert CIA programs all the way up until the Fresno Nightwalker or like Bigfoot or something like that, that seems to be given life through all of these complicated systems. Do you have thoughts about why conspiracy is so essential to today's online culture? The idea that there are hidden powers behind the scene, it's totally plausible. It's not even a speculation from a technical point of view. But we know that there's this generative power behind the thing. When it comes to something like the revolution in finance through cryptocurrencies, the notion that one pseudonymous set up in Akamoto is the architect of a whole financial system, and yet we don't know who the person is or even if they do this, that sets the mind racing. You know that the five eyes, the surveillance services are watching. You know that you've heard about Cambridge and other big all that sort of stuff. So that's just after the course. But then there is this other level of connective action rather than collective action. Before I left Berlin, some space, there were these riots in London and these riots kind of took off. Part of the analysis was that the segment of the population who were rioting, there were young people and they didn't have much money as it were for their phone plan. So they were all on Blackbury and Blackbury had a send to all in your contact service and it was free. And so there was this viral communication and everyone could show up at the job of a hat and kind of make something happen. There's also around about the same time as Occupy Wall Street and the phrase, we are the 99th attempt at this idea that if we just perform a multitude, like if we get to a number at point C, then maybe equality will emerge. So you don't have to gather behind an actual program necessarily. Not like an ideological program, you can just gather behind a technical program. You can just perform a number, you can just connect. And for this kind of slide of hand in which the idea of something really holding together intellectually and meaningfully, it switched out for almost a technical construction of a group. And I think that conspiracies are a bit like that too. And they lend themselves to laughing and role play. And it's almost like the exquisite corpse of the surrealists, you know, you just keep adding something to it. And eventually it's walking, talking, dinosaur or you know, shrinks. It's also fun, you know, conspiracies are fun. You can be part of the whole without having to even understand the whole. And there's something about this sense of scale too, which is just I think very clearly incentivized by some kind of idea of like having a more equitable society. Once you reach the appropriate scale of network effects is like exactly the promise of a webtooth Silicon Valley social media that makes that makes a lot of sense. But it's also about, you know, trying to draw the many into the one. I mean, that's our whole idea of, you know, a community or, you know, political community plays about binding in the individual into a group and having that group mean something. So if you have individual pieces of data or information and, you know, they're all potentially at your fingertips, it's just an it's just such a tempting thing to try and bind it all up into one. And then, you know, the thing is obviously they not everything can cohere into the same, well, the into one logical position or platform. That's why you end up with highly illogical political formations, but it doesn't matter because you end up with that kind of post truth in which all contradiction, not that they're resolved, it's almost that the contradiction proved the point. And then you're then you really just out on a limb, you know, with the Q&N on crowd. Maybe there's too much information and the idea of having a theory of everything that just kind of that like the landscape has been cut or designed in such a fashion to prevent people from establishing universalisms maybe. Once you solve the problems that bind everything up high about it, you figure out like what the system is, then wouldn't you know it? The system is that actually that, you know, you don't know the truth and that someone behind the scenes and like this is all it's all thanks. So that's all the way down. Just you end up in another. Yeah, it's just the whole of mirrors. Kind of love all this. I love all this and this is also I think like, you know, someone like Margaret, hello, and a lot of these works to do with like sort of AI mashups of cultural heritage. It's so interesting because what you have in these forms, which are like super monstrous hybrid kind of like mutant forms, you have the kind of visualization of the physicalization of this idea that anything can be like bashed together and like almost like smoothed out to look like one being or one agent. She's an added to kind of her forms, the sort of franken, Dr. Franken like the auto-died act. What would it be if you know a 10 year old female human injected a rabbit brain? What kind of embryo would result? It's just it's just so insane. But the forms are so fascinating. They're like our four religious totems. You can't look away from them. And this is also what my book, Poetics of Inclusion, which we're talking about today. What it said out to do is once we get to a point where the complexity of the system is just too much to be kind of held in the mind-line in its truth. Once it has to be kind of, once it has to be a metonym invoked, once you have to use folklore to explain a system that you either don't understand or that you're locked out or once you have to use like narrative or pictorial kind of methods to represent something that's inherently code like one in zero. Then you're back with analogy. You're doing analog cultures of the digital. And that is not necessarily a bad place to be. That's the world we live in most times. That's where we tell our story. I think we need to learn how how to relate the complexity and the strangeness of this moment to the ways people understood their times previously. I mean this is my training as a historian. I think that's one of the reasons you see so many illusions to classical art and prehistoric art in work that has to do with AI and the internet. And look, but Oliver Larick would be working with Greek statues forever. Nora Albajee is working with prehistoric artifacts from the Mesopotamia and the rock. I mean you see people like Agile Crab using Gant to reconstruct classical statuaries. I mean it goes on. These are all tokens for a time of humanism. I think time of humanism. Nadim, thank you so much for joining me today. I just I absolutely love the frame of your book and it's a real pleasure to read. You've managed to collect basically I would say all of my favorite artists into one anthology series and it's just an absolute pleasure. Thank you so much for joining me on the podcast and I hope to see you soon in Berlin.",

      "text": "Max Reed, welcome to the podcast. Thanks for having me. You're a journalist, you're a screenwriter and an editor, you've written for the New York Times and New York Magazine. I first came across your work in 2019 because you referenced very early on my Politigram essay in a piece about Andrew Yang. And I followed your work very closely ever since and I really enjoyed that piece. Today you're mostly on Substack. Yeah, I made the transition in 2020. I left magazines in 2020 and I spent a year kind of doing screenwriting stuff. Listeners can Google why I got out of it, but basically Tim Cook personally killed a show that I was working on for Apple. And I mostly do Substack now, it's great. You know, I got my start at Galker many, many, many years ago and Substack is the closest thing to that kind of old school blogging that can still make you a living these days. So I enjoy leaning back into that early career origins. I have to say I'm a huge fan of your newsletter. I follow it every week. maxread.substack.com where you can read max read. I like to call it read maxing. Your recent podcast episode by the way was great discussing Silicon Valley and this turn towards the Trumpian right JD Vance, Murray Rothbard, anarcho capitalism. You hit a few boxes for me there. I was very into it. Yeah, I mean, this is like a really amazing moment to be sort of interested in the things that you and I are interested in. The sort of like the tech right as you say, the kind of the bubbling like internet first ideologies that seem to have now suddenly been adopted by a bunch of major Silicon Valley capitalists and executives and investors. It's obviously going sort of a bumpy ride for Sacks and Andreessen and JD Vance, but it doesn't make you feel like you were on the right track all those years ago writing about do-immers and writing about Andrew Yang and whatever else that some of this stuff is finally really coming good. Yeah, I think that doing this research, doing this writing is often just about time stamping. If you're talking about trend forecasting or political trend forecasting essentially, like what kind of fringe ideas are going to become very influential soon. It's nice to look back at that and be like, oh yeah, tagged that like five years ago and now it's really, really happening. There's one thing I'm not sure if you covered this in your episode, but I was discussing this with a friend of mine, maybe won't mention his name, but he's a PhD candidate at Harvard. He doesn't have an online life. He's very much anonymous online. But part of this turn towards the Trumpian right on behalf of Silicon Valley, we can think of like Mark Andreessen, for example, he's been running with this rhetoric about how the Biden administration obviously coconut paradigm and so on. But what was revealed in, I think it was April, there was a certain policy from the Biden administration that speculative gains on your portfolio, meaning if you're holding stock working at a tech company, that was going to be taxed like capital gains. This is a really, really significant penalty for people who work in tech startups. And Andreessen has been running with this line that this is going to destroy small tech. But only the big companies would be able to survive. Essentially, this would bankrupt the startup model because mostly what people take is like half salary, half equity, they're compensated in stock options because they don't have the capital flow to be able to pay everyone the full salary that they'd earn at Google or so on. And yeah, what that would mean is that every year when you file your taxes, your speculative valuation of your stock, which is notoriously overvalued in these industries, you'd be taxed like capital gains and it would have a really devastating effect on the startup industry. The interesting thing now is that the Silicon Valley people have already kind of declared their allegiance to the Natcon program. And we have no idea what Kamala Harris's policy is going to be on any of this tech stuff. No, I mean, there's a really interesting, I mean, that, I think that's a really good point. And one of the things that I think is really interesting about what you're saying is that maps what I see as a kind of division between entrepreneurial capital, small tech, let's call it and the sort of big businesses of Silicon Valley that the interests of somebody like Mark Zuckerberg or Reid Hoffman, who's a major Kamala Harris backer are probably not the same as the interests of a venture capitalist like Andreessen or his partner Ben Harowitz or even Peter Teal stuff like taxing like employee stock programs in ways that are going to make it harder to hire people away is not beneficial obviously to capitalists who are looking for major returns on their startup investments. But it's probably beneficial to Tim Cook and to Zuckerberg and to guys who want to keep their top level engineers and earners. And I think what we're seeing right now is big business tech, this sort of the platform side had been really wary of Biden because of Lena Khan and the way the FTC had been going pretty aggressively after them. But we're also not necessarily cozying up to Trump because Trump was much more closely aligned with this sort of small tech, entrepreneurial side of the valley. And I think they see an opportunity in Kamala Harris who is after all like a Bay Area Democrat who's been kind of in sconce in the tech industry her whole. I was just reading she went to Sean Parker's wedding which was sort of famously this like I believe he got married in Sequoia maybe illegally. I've been on a slander. But I'm pretty sure it was he like did he like flouted some parks regulations and then I think the whole wedding ceremony was like regulations. No, absolutely not. The whole ceremony I believe was in Elvis was in like Lord of the Rings. Oh my God. Kamala Harris is there. She's friends with Reed Hoffman. So she's I think the hope is that on the part of people like Reed Hoffman is that she's going to fire Lena Khan. She's going to be the same kind of friend to tech that Obama was. I think it's going to be really interesting to watch her tread this tightrope. I mean, I'm like I don't have a clear sense of how big the anti tech or the tech skeptical can just constituency in the Democratic Party is and she you know it's a lot of leverage to to be the alternative to Trump. So it's sort of like who's going to who's not going to vote even if she has these sort of pro business policies. So I don't know. I think that's one of the most interesting things to watch about this election season and and you know over the next administration whoever wins. Yeah. I mean, it feels like right now I would say post assassination attempt I was very much like oh, Trump's got this in the bag, but a lot has changed in the last few weeks. Kamala, it's just totally different story now and it feels like we're at a point where it's just very difficult to make these kind of predictions because there's just too many variables right now. What I think both you and I are interested in is not forecasting in the length of like a few months or like a single election cycle, but like these big macro shifts through culture that can take like a decade to play out. And why I wanted to invite you on the podcast this week is because you wrote this really incredible, I think very significant piece that has to be fair kind of blown up in a few places. It was featured on NPR recently. It's kind of made the rounds, but you coined this term, the zinternet, which is I think actually very significant. This is a very significant development in the arc of social media. I think we're in a new era. We'll talk about some of the details around that. I should mention as well that you are a lurker in the Do Not Research Discord and a bunch of people had posted that piece because they also called it and were really captivated by this term. What is the zinternet? Yeah, I mean, I think it's the kind of like if you're online and you hear the phrase the zinternet, I bet you know exactly sort of what I'm talking about, but maybe the way to talk about it is sort of anthropologically like, you know, I've been, I don't tweet very much anymore, but I've been on, I've still on Twitter, I still read a lot of it. I'm on Instagram, you know, I try to follow, I follow stuff that's interesting to me, but obviously like as everybody does, I get served up all kinds of things. I've been noticing over the last, let's say, five years, the sort of growth of a particular kind of community online or like a loose network of people who follow a lot of the same kind of influencers and media outlets who share a bunch of the same kind of cultural reference and sort of cultural interests. And in the, in the piece itself, I was sort of saying it's a little bit like what you might call sports internet, which is just sort of obviously, it's people talking about sports all day. And it's a little bit adjacent to like the kind of hustle culture, crypto, Miami, Dubai kind of internet. And it's a little bit like, there's a little bit of a sort of concordance with tried internet, macho, masculinist, tried internet. But there's this other group that's kind of, that's adjacent to these, but is not the same thing. And I think of it, it's like college, is there interested in college football, Miller Highlights, sort of frat culture. They are, they follow bar stool sports, but there's a bunch of other kind of gambling adjacent podcasts. There's tons of sports gambling is interested. And maybe sort of most importantly, at least for the name, they love these Zen nicotine pouches, which are these little like Swedish little pouches of nicotine that you put in your, in your, in your lip, like dip. But I mean, I think it's sort of interestingly sort of a sanitized version of like dip, which was, you know, huge in my school. And I imagine in years too, among like baseball players and the cross players. And it was useful to sort of put a name on these guys. And the moment I did was right around when Hock Tua, the meme of the girl, you know, describing how to make a man go wild. I can't remember the exact, you know, phrasing, but she was like, sometimes, you know, she got a Hock Tua and spit on that thing. And this was, I mean, she's kind of still, she just signed up for Twitter or something. I mean, she's still sort of, she's just not Bill Mar, this week. She's not Bill Mar. Yeah. She's continuing her, her sort of viral, her viral fame. But you know, it was interesting about it was this was a meme that emerged like and broke wide across all different kinds of internet communities from this internet, you know, way that I hadn't really seen kind of memes or phrases or slang or any of the kinds of things that you expect to come, you know, you expect to emerge from internet subcultures and come out. And it felt like a good moment to kind of put a name on this emergent subculture and to sort of figure out like what it was, what its place was, what its, what its politics were, what its role in this ecosystem is. Just to like, to be too intelligent here, I'd sort of gone over in my head. I wanted to call it like parlay, bet, internet or, you know, sort of like college football internet. And then a friend of mine was like, it's like Zen Twitter. And I was like, okay, Zenternet, that's what it is. That's the thing. I do think I do think like it's one of those things. You have to get the catchy name and then it really comes into focus. That's yeah. Yeah. You would certainly have a gift for for coining these terms. I wanted to read a quick quote from the piece here. I think you call it a broad community of fratty, horn dog, borrishly provocative 20 somethings. Mostly male has emerged to form a new online subculture. And you're triangulating this kind of as you said between the sports internet, the hustle internet and the reactionary internet. And this is a scene of like college sports, sports gambling, light domestic beers and Zen nicotine pouches. So the emergence of this particular subculture, I would say is qualitatively different than subcultures we've seen emerged through the past. And I would attribute a lot of that to being a larger shift, like a macroeconomic shift in the incentives of the platforms. And the way that platforms have been designed, say contrasted to like 10 years ago, what we thought of as internet subcultures of like niche, emergent genres and hashtags on Tumblr, like C-Ponk and Witchhouse and Pale Goth and all of this kind of stuff. Those things were like really, really niche. But the zinternet is I think incredibly mainstream actually. This is a very interesting development and it reflects a kind of developmental arc of social media and some of the new things that have been introduced in the last few years. I'm curious to ask about the influencers attached to this scene, but I think just to give a little bit of context for the kind of incentive structure in a lot of these spaces. I think people generally in our peer group are, they're probably not aware of how big of an industry online sports betting actually is. It's hard to get particular numbers on this, but it's in the tens of billions. That's a 2024 estimate. And I think it was, was it legalized in, was it 2019 or when did they allow it? Well, I know it was after I started my newsletter because it wrote about it. It was 2021 in New York 2021. And the next year was almost legalized in California, but it was defeated at the ballot box. It's legal and not quite a majority of states. I mean, I think the way to know how big this is is if you listen to a podcast oriented to normal men, you will hear sports gambling ads nonstop. It's like the, you know, it's what stamps.com was 10 years ago. If you listen to any kind of sports podcast, but even if you just listen to like a comedy podcast that has two guys on it, you are likely to hear a sports gambling ad. And they're very funny because they have to like put all the disclaimers in. They have the ads last like four minutes and everybody speeds up and everything. And what's I think interesting about this is that if you look at a lot of the viral content that circulates on this internet, a lot of those big accounts have a link in their bio for one of these sports betting companies. So in the last few years, a multi billion dollar industry has emerged that has kind of no overlap with our like niche internet culture intellectual sphere. So we might not be as explicitly aware of it, but there's a huge audience of people out there who are participating in this and they're making a lot of money. In some cases, who are some of the influencers that permeate this space? So probably the best known is Dave Portnoy, who's the founder, editor, and chief of bar stool sports. And Dave and bar stool have been around for a long time, 15, maybe 20 years, sort of slowly growing from a kind of off-color sports blog. They were purchased by a gambling company five or six years ago. Then the gambling company, I mean, the sort of the business structure of these companies is kind of crazy. To be a company, you have to get a bookie license basically. And so you get your booking license, and then you go find a license, you go license like an identity. So bar stool, bar stool for a while was the identity of this one gambling company. And then the gambling company made a pact with ESPN, which is obviously a much bigger brand, a sort of more reliable brand, whatever you want to say, and sold bar stool back to Dave Portnoy, who now runs it. I mean, I want to borrow Ezra Marcus on Twitter, once called it, he said, I don't think people understand that bar stool is no longer really a blog. It's like a multi-platform reality show where Dave Portnoy forces all of his employees to undertake stunts in order to get traffic. Which, that's kind of what blogging has to be now, I think, but that's what bar stool is. It's a group of personalities. I don't know all their names. There's big cat, KFC, PFT commenter. They've got podcasts, they're on TikTok. They tweet a lot. They do, like, make blogs. It's advertising revenue. I think they're still gambling affiliate revenue. I know the name of every 100 follower, mega-communist influencer, but I've heard of none of these people. I know this is a totally different world. But these guys, I mean, some of these guys have been around for a decade or more. I mean, one reason I sort of know them is, you know, when I was a gaukour, we sat right near the deadspin guys. And deadspin was the gaukour sports blog. Deadspin was a more gaukoury in its, both in its politics and also in its kind of tone. It was like, for a long time, it was sort of thought of itself as more intelligent than say a bar stool or whatever. But you can see the kind of, they feel, they felt much more adjacent in say 2010 or 2012 or whatever than they would now than de facto, which is like the air to deadspin, the co-op, the cooperatively owned sports blog and bar stool, which is just whatever however you want to describe it. And so anyway, I say that I've known about these guys because of this for a really long time. They've got this broad platform. And I should say, like you want to talk about antecedents to this internet about, I want to say in 2019 or 2020, somebody, I can't remember who it was. It was a relatively prominent conservative pun that wrote a piece called bar stool conservatives who wrote about, you know, the need to sort of, for the Republican, there's all this, this big group of men who are like naturally conservative and their Republican party should be appealing to them. It's a sort of funny idea partly because you see this crop up for the over the last 20 or 25 years. You see this idea about what to do with this big group of like young, not particularly political, maybe, maybe like, you know, socially and economically lean conservative, but have certain like liberal cultural ideas, you know, South Park libertarian. That was like a, I think it was a reason magazine cover at some point or they had another cover about like video game libertarians. This idea never quite pans out the way conservatives want it to partly because I don't think these are particularly recognizable guys. Like I don't, I think this group of people to the extent that it has a, like a political orientation is really resistant to that kind of like partisan commitment. I was, I was curious to ask about because when I think of Zinn and the prominence of that meme in the last few years, I also think of the NELK boys, right, who did this huge stunt where they had like a six foot can or a tin of Zinn, a container of Zinn that was lowered by a helicopter. They had that huge podcast, a viral podcast with Tucker Carlson who was taking Zinn, part of what lifted off the significance of that meme. And the NELK boys are conservative influencers. You know, I'm curious about what you think the political leanings of this internet are. You know, on my notes, I wrote libertarian ish, but maybe just kind of a political political. Yeah, it's interesting, right? Like there was a slate piece that came out right after my internet piece that I think was a little bit too aggressive in sort of labeling this internet as like a mega place and like a deeply conservative place. I mean, to me, one of the funniest things about the Hock Tua meme was watching guys like Ian Miles Chong, these sort of like deep reactionary influencers and personalities try really hard to make it about them and about their politics. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, kind of being totally unable to. And I thought that was reflective of like the broader's internet that there are affinities with conservatism. Like I think there's a lot of, I mean, think about like the frats that sort of literally fought the propalastein protestors at a bunch of Southern universities. Like there is a political conservatism there, but like I said, I think it's resistant to like partisanship. Like a lot of internet subcultures, I think one sort of major taboo is caring too much like you really can't you it's you don't want to be seen as being political. I mean, to give another sort of example, it's a Zach Bryan, the singer songwriter, it's a huge country star, but is also like particularly sort of his internet star. His girlfriend, Brianna Chickenwing, I think is her name is the host of the Barstool Affiliated podcast. He's like the Bruce Springsteen of this internet. I like Brian. He's like a smart. He's a smart. He's a very clearly a smart guy. He's a very interesting story. He's like an ex-navy guy who was making song who's writing his own songs on TikTok and he blew up and he's sort of turned it into this huge career. And he tweeted recently something about I if I had the guess, I don't I think Zach Bryan is not a Trump guy. Like I'm not saying he's a Kamala Harris guy, but he strikes I mean, now his favorite his favorite songwriters are like Jason Isbel and like Merle Haggard. Like he's a guy he's steeped in the sort of what we might call the intellectual side of countryside. But he tweeted something to the effect of like, I don't care about politics. If you think too much about politics, I don't want to have anything to do with it. Right. No, no, that's that's it. That's it. It's like it's weird to be too into politics. Yeah. That's actually yeah. For a mainstream audience, it's weird if you're obsessed with this stuff. Yeah, the post-order goes beyond it. And I think that, you know, I think that there's a kind of this cross isn't in ways that you kind of expect and you can kind of understand, even if you just map it to US politics in the first place. The Portonoy is strongly pro-abortion for like obvious sort of dirtbag reasons. But also like he is a Massachusetts, he's like a white college educated Massachusetts guy. He's like probably maybe in some circumstances is going to vote for Republicans. Like there are like these kinds of things that there's a lot of cross pressure on this group. And so yes, I think that like socially conservative in general, like I don't think I would be like there's a lot of them that I would have no desire to like spend time with. But there's, you know, I don't know, I suppose the way to put it honestly is like if you've ever been inside a frat house, like you're going to meet a lot of different types of guys and some of them are just going to be impossible to deal with. And in the college Republicans and just like you don't want to fuck around with them. And some of them are just going to be kind of normal guys and probably don't think about politics that much and maybe have some particular leaning one way or the other. But the main focus is like we said, like domestic beer, zin, you know, listening to country music, like in hooking up basically. Yeah. Sports is how you spend most of your time and then politics is like a distant priority in most cases. Is this the internet for normy guys? Is this just, is the internet for normies now? Like because these people, they don't have like explicit ideological convictions. They've got maybe incoherent swing voter energy in some cases. They, you know, probably if I had to summarize their political positions, it would be like just American common sense, like small business owner type of politics, not really a big like geopolitical frame or strong ideological leanings, just kind of like American common sense. I mean, it's a difficult time to maintain that. But also we have to remind ourselves that like we are in a very particular, very niche field of doing large scale political trend casting. And most people don't think about this at all. And so the sentiment of a lot of these people is just kind of like, oh, politics is fucked bro. Like that's, that's kind of it. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, one thing I wrote in the piece that is just a sort of hunch that I haven't, I haven't like done more thought or research into it is that, you know, I think that the sort of straight male jock, you know, just to use a shorthand for the guys who are in this internet was like among the last types to get online and to be online permanently or at least in great numbers. So the last 20 years, one way of thinking about the internet is that it's been, it's become this huge cultural influence while oversampling a lot of, for lack of a better word, marginalized groups that there's, you know, that like one way that culture has been shaped by the internet is by seeing the voices of gay and trans and minority groups much more visible than they ever were before. If only by virtue of the fact that they represent much higher percentages of people who are online, then, you know, like white, straight, cis, etc. You can even extrapolate that out beyond identity that, for example, if you were a big fan of Warhammer 40k, there's not a lot of people who share your interest in your local town. And so people who are of smaller groups, either identity wise or just hobby wise, they have to go online. And so it tends to be disproportionately representative of those people who are already seeking out community. And then, you know, the normies are kind of the last to sign up for all these platforms, but now they've taken over. Yeah, I mean, I think that's, I do think that's a big part of it is like, now everybody's online, everybody's on social networks, it's not weird to be online, it's not weird to like have a big social life online. And so groups that when I was in college, we're not really very online are as online as everybody else. And therefore, our shaping and being shaped by the culture there as anyone else. The other thing that's sort of happening, to the extent there's a sort of materialist basis for this, the legalization of sports gambling and the money that flows into like media figures is a real, I think is a real thing that drives the kind of prominence of this internet. And the other thing is, especially on Twitter, though I think this is kind of true of some of the other platforms too, that Elon Musk taking over, which sort of, you know, has a set of ramifications that, you know, it's hard to, it's hard to lay with us and say all of them in a short amount of time. But like, that's what we might call the sort of big left liberal bubble of journalists and academics has really been pierced. A lot of people left. It's much harder. There's a lot less prominence for those people. Whereas, you know, sort of really, for lack of a better word, basic blue check, post sports highlights, you know, post dumb jokes about beer. That's like a real, that's big lane on Twitter these days. You know, if you want to be a little bit more cynical about it, there's a, there's like, a lot of the groups you listed before, the sort of sports reactionary hustle, these sort of masculinist, I think of them as loosely as like, like, not Macho strictly speaking, but like male oriented, four men, by men, those groups have done particularly well on Twitter since Elon took over, whether that's because of explicit sort of, you know, platform monkey around or whether that's just because of allegiance, platform allegiance has shifted. And you see some of this elsewhere, you know, you see it on TikTok and you see it on Instagram too, that like this content does well, there's a whole sort of back and forth network of it. And so I think it's these things, it's sort of normies entering, this sort of normy core entering the internet at the same time that like gambling money is flowing in and at the same time that the sort of era of trust and safety being a really important, you know, thing about platforms, not just Twitter, but all platforms, but maybe especially Twitter, have sort of all happened at the same time to give this group like this, this sort of outsized or maybe not outsized cultural prominence. Yeah. And you know, it's, it's visible, like I said, it's visible in memes like Hock Tua sort of coming out of nowhere, but it's also just, I think if you go to your for you page on Twitter say, you're just going to see a lot more sort of zinternet type stuff than you would have, you know, even a year ago, but especially then four or five years ago. Yeah, yeah, we've got this unique situation where the late adopters who are now all getting on these platforms in like massive, massive numbers in the last few years also have this increased purchasing power in that now there's this new industry that opens up that is very happy to take their money for sports gambling and it's incredibly profitable. And so there's a big incentive shift where a lot of those prominent content creators pivot their content into being viral marketing funnels for online sports betting in that if you can create a meme that is very transmittable and you know, let's say you have a 1% conversion rate, but this content is seen by a million people and then a very small percentage of them click through to the link in your bio and they end up placing a bet on a sports game. That's very, very profitable. And so virality rather than consistent blogging has really risen to prominence in the last few years, particularly because of these incentives. And what is also interesting I think is that we do have to factor in the phenomena of TikTok and the 4U pageification of basically everything, right? Because up until a few years ago, there were these very dedicated audiences that followed specific influencers, people who had like a face and a name to their brand and accumulated trust had a dedicated audience, a loyal audience, I would follow them for a long time. And now more and more, all of these platforms like Instagram, X, TikTok, obviously even Spotify, things like this, the 4U pageification of the internet is actually it's a really, really addictive model that increases watch times. And so what this has done is like relatively disempower those influencers who had those like really strong bonds of trust and accumulated following over a long time. And now you're kind of watching a lot of material that's suited to you, but you may not know the person who made it. You might not know the influencer, you might not recognize the account, you may not even be following them, but algorithmically you know that it's tailored to your interests. And so that has created a pretty unique weird internet that's what weird to me, but I guess it's normal to most people. And now there's all of this content that's kind of marketing to these guys. And it's incredibly, incredibly profitable. So this 4U pageification, viral marketing funnels for online sports betting. And you know, maybe there's an element here that is like the third variable of something of a vibe shift. Maybe this has to do with Elon's takeover of Twitter, but we are going through something of like a revenge of the normie conservatives, the kind of cultural backlash or something like that in the last few years. Does that play a part in this somehow? Yeah, I think so. I mean, I think like, you know, bolstered by the things you're saying, I'll just add to by the way, there's a lot of this sort of viral marketing funneling. And in some cases, the gambling companies are just straight up funding editorial content that includes this viral stuff. So it's like, he's not just that you're hoping to get a few pennies or whatever. It's like your whole salary is paid by these guys and you're producing this other stuff. But yeah, I mean, I think to answer your question, like there's a kind of a revenge of normie conservatives is a good way to put it. But also, I think there's a kind of generational shift at play. Like I think the the collegeness of this, not that everybody in this internet is still in college, but that maybe the youth of it is kind of worth thinking through that, you know, 10 years ago, you know, I wasn't in college 10 years ago, but I was relatively close, let's say, to having still been in college. And there was a particular kind of culture at play and a particular kind of idea of what was going on. And it's not surprising that in 10 years, the sort of youth culture of the moment has shifted and maybe is leaning away from the classic millennial values, let's say, to a different set of zoom or values. And so I think in addition to a kind of revenge of the normie conservatives, I think part of what's happening, and you know, I try not to get to hung up on generational theory, because I think a lot of it's sort of bunk. But part of what's happening is that the kind of millennial hegemony of the internet is being challenged by younger people who have the different ideas of what's cool and different values about what they want out of the life and out of the world. And I think this internet is sort of particularly important here because a lot of it is like opposed to what we think of as the kind of millennial internet values of like we said before, trust and safety and sort of honoring and raising up marginalized voices. So yeah, I mean, I think backlash is absolutely right. I mean, as we all know, this sort of novelty tends to help you do really well online, like even as a whole subcultural thing, being the novel subculture is a really good way to travel and to find new followers and new people who are going to look at what you do. I think the clearest trend between millennials and zoomers in terms of their values and the things that they pursue in life and what is a meaningful life, generationally speaking, is that the millennials were kind of the last people to believe in the values of a humanity's education. And I'm saying this as someone who teaches in a university and a graduate program who still sees value in all those things, but undeniably, the humanity is kind of shrunk. There's overwhelming statistical data that people who study the humanities, they have lower prospects in the labor market later on, they're doing generationally worse than their parents. And so there's been kind of a realignment with zoomer interests, zoomer ideas of culture, ideas of individual authorship and creativity and kind of the value of being like a unique millennial snowflake to use the phrase. And then you see rising levels of attendance and enrollment in STEM and things that have higher earning potential later in life. And a lot of that in fairness was kind of the boomer hangover of really believing in the value of a higher education of thinking that that was the key to upward mobility. And so I'm speaking because I did this myself, but studying art and things like that that don't necessarily prepare you in the best way to earn a living later in life. The zoomers just don't seem to be falling for that. And so yeah, their taste is maybe a little bit different and it is kind of less creatively or artistically inclined. And one might even say less individualistically inclined in that the millennial generation are kind of like individual creative entrepreneur slash narcissist on social media because that was the world that we were given. We were given Facebook and things like this. And it's just very different now because the internet has just been thoroughly optimized and is already conquered by brands and so on. The other thing I wanted to ask you here related to this generational shift, to me, this seems like this is just the way it's going to be. This is a new chapter actually, the emergence of this internet in contrast to those niche tumblr subcultures that constituted what being extremely online was maybe a decade ago. Those things are not really, I don't think that they're coming back. I think this is actually part of the development of social media. We go through these different periods where you see early adopters, mid adopters, and late adopters. And so I don't necessarily expect that there's going to be a flourishing Cambrian explosion of niche internet subcultures. I kind of think that the incentives have really shifted and that this internet or zinternet like I'm sure there's a zinternet for young women also that someone else will come up with a great name for. But I just think that this is going to be how it is basically. My friends of the new models podcast, Carly and Julian, call this the hundredocracy catering to the mid, catering basically to the majority needing to pull in those numbers and not really having the same kind of like long tail nicheification that constituted the earlier era of the internet. Do you feel like this is something that's going to continue from now on or is this, is there a trend cycle to this? Or is this just going to be the way that it is? It's really hard to say. I mean, let me think through it because I think that's a really great question. I think it's like bang on about about one of the dynamics currently influencing how culture is created online. Something that fascinates me, the certain emergencies over the last few years, I wrote about Mr. Beast last year for the New York Times magazine. Right. The thing that shock isn't quite the right word, but the thing that really struck me about what he does is how much it resembles television. I mean, like classic sort of network television, even basic cable television. And I'm quite used to this idea that you go on YouTube and you're finding completely new forms that like streaming, like video game streaming just hadn't existed, like what you do, Josh actually just had not existed when I was a kid. And in many ways those forms were kind of alien and strange to me. But Mr. Beast, who is the biggest YouTuber on the planet, he's doing HGTV home reno type things. He's doing like local, sappy local news charity coverage. He's doing sort of reality show competitions. He's doing them for YouTube audience in a YouTube way. But there is this real familiarity to his stick. And it is catering to mid. It is that sort of like sense that you're going to reach the biggest like in some ways it's like the car sinnization of content. It's like actually they figured out what does well with Americans a hundred years ago, you know, the big networks did. And we've just been doing different versions of it on different platforms in all the time since. And so I think, you know, like you say, this is sort of, this is something that happens with this internet. I think this internet, especially the sort of like in some ways, you know, is recapitulating some combination of ESPN and Howard Stern and other like shock jocks of the 90s, all the stuff that like men are into online this internet and Joe Rogan and like Bitcoin hustle culture like that all has its antecedents. It isn't necessarily all that new. There have been jerky guys talking about sports and women on the radio, you know, forever. I think the question is about to sort of borrow a Silicon Valley term is about disruption. Like what opened up this sort of ability for niche subcultures to exist, to flourish, to even in some cases drive conversations and drive politics and culture was the way that the internet and social platforms broke up the old sort of monopolies, broke up the old, you know, the dominant media. The doopily is the triopily is whatever. Yeah. And I think that, you know, we're in a position I genuinely, I think it's like a 50 50 whether or not we're just entering a new period of sort of platform stagnation, let's say, with no disruptive technologies changing the way media is distributed and consumed. And I think that's like to me, that's the question is if there's something new that has a different sensibility to it that encourages different kinds of things that can open up the sort of the door again to the kinds of things that flourish in the 2010s, I have seen no reason why we couldn't sort of break this particular spell. But if Facebook and Twitter and TikTok and Instagram are basically in their final form, you know, that they've reached their kind of, they're not going to monkey around them very much from now on, then this is what we're going to get is this kind of thing. Yeah. Like, you know, if you're somebody like us who has always loved this sort of strange and wild side of the internet, it is, it's a bummer, but it's going to be very different internet than it was in our childhood and adolescence and even young adulthood. Yeah. I think the obvious answer to this is that subcultures will continue to exist, but they'll definitely be in dark forest type spaces, you know, and we could kind of contrast like the mainstream, normie internet, zinternet like content, and then there'll be these kind of like private spaces in dark forest communities. Yeah. Social media, I've been saying this for a little while, but I really think that social media is now just cable TV for the millennial generation. It's totally populated with ads. You're literally seeing QVC like novelty products of like non-stick pans and, you know, little household hacks and stuff like that. People also talk, they've been saying this for the past few years, but we are in something of content death spiral, meaning that not that there's a lack of content, but what that means is that the individuals who use social media are posting less. They're scrolling a lot, but they're sharing less of their content and the people who are sharing are brands, people who have stuff to advertise. And so if you scroll your feed now, you are much more likely to see some kind of sponsored posts and advertisement punctuated between a viral reel, all of this stuff that is like kind of the 4U pageification of the internet, you're much more likely to see that than like a picture of your friend's salad that they had for lunch or something like that. You know, these kind of like personal updates and following your friends and staying in touch with your community, it's a lot less likely to see that versus this kind of cable TV advertising model that has really, really taken over. Yeah, I mean, there's a real way too that cable TV was always sort of one of the innovations, I think, of cable channels was the recognition that the really high quality, well, high qualities are on word, the really high production value stuff that the networks were putting on to attract top quality advertisers was not necessarily necessary in order to draw on viewers that good enough was good enough and you could cut corners and make stuff that wasn't quite as good and still make money between subscriptions and ads. And you know, the internet has taught us that lesson again and we seem to continually see, I mean, you know, as an S, the S like somebody who enjoys, you know, intelligent quality, you know, thoughtful posts, let's say it's a bomber, but realistically, if all you want is attention and a handful of clicks and somebody to buy your non-stick pan or whatever, you don't need to put a huge amount of effort into it. I mean, in many cases, you just need to steal something online. I'm working on a piece right now for a New York magazine about AI Slop. One of the interesting things about it is the extent to which this is sort of, this is brought on by the platforms themselves, you know, that there is, if you create an infinite marketplace for attention and then you build a machine that can create infinite content, they're just going to meet each other right there in the middle. And I mean, all these discourse now with these sort of teenage hustlers from all over the world, trying to figure out the best strategy for making brain-wrote videos on TikTok and whatever else. And I think, you know, this is like, I don't think it's ever going to like, I'm not a dead internet theory part as a necessarily, but I think the dead internet theory is a good metaphor for this kind of sense that the bar keeps getting lower. And what feels like cable now, like, is going to, I just think it's going to keep feeling worse, worse, worse. It's going to get into the bottom. Yeah. Yeah. I'm reminded of my friend, Jack Ritgar, a contributor to Do Not Research was recently on the new models podcast. And he was talking about prestige television today, how it's written intentionally to be a second screen, right? And so what I mean by that is that people are watching TV in the background and they're picking up on the plot points in the main characters and whatever, but they're also scrolling their phone and their attention is kind of divided between the two. And so the way that prestige television has to be written now compared to like 15 years ago, for example, is that the characters can't be too complex. You can have these big, you know, hairpin turns in the arc of the plot. And, and, you know, this guy's a good guy in act one and a bad guy in act three. That just confuses the audience because they're half paying attention. They're watching TikTok at the same time. And so just the level of like artistry, the level of craftsmanship, the level of complexity has really been dumbed down by all of these things. And one is tempted to look at this as like this race in the attention economy is just everyone is kind of like catering to the lowest common denominator. And thus, the internet is born. And it's like, you know, jokes about toilet humor. And it's like sexy memes and people dancing and like sports and gambling and just like really kind of silly libidinal, you know, low quality content. And that's, that's really where we are right now. I mean, sports is a good, it's like a real example of this. Like my Instagram, my Instagram reels that like I get to after I start swiping is just filled with basketball and baseball highlights that I've seen hundreds of times before that are being ripped by guys who knows where they are. And yet there I am just sort of re, you know, rewatching highlights from Jordan's flu game or whatever. And it's like, I guess this is, this is, this is it. It's catering to the mid. And I, in this case, I am the mid like I am right there. Like sure, I've seen this before, but I just need something to do for another 10 minutes or whatever. Well, it is entertaining. I mean, we should be clear, the reason why all this stuff works we're kind of lamenting the loss of these, you know, cool, interesting, weird internet subcultures. But this is just out competing the old model. It is more profitable. It is working better. And that's why the social media companies have leaned into it. It's not like a ideological thing. How they want to platform A and not B. It's just actually a more compelling model and people use it more. So that's why it's going on. Yeah. What are you working on next? You're working on this piece from New York magazine. You're talking about AI Slop. Yeah. Yeah, give us a hint of what you've got coming down the pipeline. It's, yeah, so I have this Slop piece for New York that hopefully will come out. You're using chat GPT to write it no doubt. Yeah, I should. Probably the end of the end of this month, maybe early next month. It's, you know, it's about Slop, but it's about kind of the content mill, the content mills online and not just online, but, you know, I'm talking to librarians who are suddenly seeing Amazon print onto man Slop show up in their shops, talking to academics who are seeing, I'm sure people have seen some of these viral sort of, you know, AI created diagrams and AI written academic papers. It's an interesting one. And then I'm just writing the newsletter. We'll be covering the election in Kamala Harris. We'll be covering developments in Internet culture. I'm talking about whatever crosses my mind. So yeah, it was great being on here. Josh. Yeah. Yeah, Max. Thank you so much. You can follow Max max read dot sub stack dot com.

      "text": "What did you set out trying to do? Did you want to work in galleries or did you want to do art criticism? I mean, when I was a teenager, I was obsessed with the idea of pop cultural media. Magazines in the 90s had this explosion where desktop publishing allowed people to create independent magazines like purple and face and ray and self-service. And there were like all these magazines that unlocked all these microcultures. And it was like a proto-internet, right? And the world building that these magazines did was really captivating to me through luck and some connections. I got to intern at Kahn-N-S as a teenager and seeing that machine work from the inside, understanding how it was directing certain cultural forces. I thought this is really fascinating. This is a really interesting industry. So I just wanted to work in magazines, to be honest. I really liked the format, I really liked the pace. I thought that that would be the trajectory. I worked in the gallery as a way of, I mean, it was a job that was offered to me and it was a way of understanding that part of the system. And by that point, I had gone to grad school and was really interested in cultural theory and media theory. And art seemed to be the place where this would be professionally viable. So I mean, I really just was like water running downhill. I was just following things that were offered and it seemed like they were going in the right direction. And then it imploded, right? Like, literally started art forum. And it was like when that Damien Hurts skull was sold at auction for like $1 trillion. And that was my first issue. And it was just the height. It was right before the financial crash. And by September of that year, already they were like, oh, not so sure. This is the whole thing is going to last. My professional life has been one of like, you know, the ground continuously sort of eroding from underneath me. But that's also freeing because you then realize that you better build your own boat. Because you can't trust the one you're on necessarily. Well, I like to joke that I was here before Beverly's was built. But now I'm actually so old. I mean, seasoned and experienced that no one even knows what Beverly's is. So, you know, that was the dime square before dime square existed. Carly Busta from the new models podcast, welcome back. Probably the most frequent crossover episodes that we've done. Do you want to give people for, we'll say, the slim minority of my audience that are not familiar with new models? What exactly is that project? Who are your collaborators? And yeah, let people know what you do. Sure. Well, Josh, thanks for having me on. I'm super excited because I feel that new models and Josh and Matt and Holly of Interdependence. We've all crossed over several times. But this is the first time you and I have recorded one on one. So excited about that. New models is a project that comes out of a similar spirit as Josh's DNR and Interdependence. And a number of art world adjacent initiatives that started because they saw the end of the road with what we loosely call legacy media. We can define that later linear media, let's say. And the physics as my partner, little internet, Julian says of social media. And we felt that it was just not supporting discourse, but it's also wasn't supporting a digital home where we like to hang out. It just felt really bad. We started new models. It was conceived in 2017. We launched it in 2018. Initially, it was a aggregator where we were just taking text. We were saying that like the writers fees are so low, publications are all asking the same pool of writers to write about the same thing. Nobody can get any attention for their articles. So why don't we go through and cherry pick the best articles we're seeing out there, put them all on one, drug report like page, which at the time was a flex because at the time drug was very much associated with right wing politics or whatnot. But we were like, you know, anyway, you slice it. It's like one of the most visited sites, at least for an American demographic. So there's something about that digital architecture that works. What if we fill it with stuff that isn't necessarily sensationalizing and maybe like right wing adjacent, would have we just filled it with like art content or cultural theory, what would happen out of that? We started a podcast because we wanted a space to talk through some of the themes we were putting together. And then about six months later, somebody in the subscribing community suggested we started discord. So we did and very similar to DNR, the community took on a life of its own and it became a holographic media space with a community and a top down signal. And we're still writing that wave trying to recalibrate to whatever form of media comes next. Yeah, I like to think that if, and actually I'm paraphrasing from Lauren Boyle here, but if crowdfunding had been around when this was in the heyday of curating exhibitions before they transitioned to being purely a video platform, young creative communities might have looked very different at that period. So I think the idea is that we sent out the strong signal over social media in the form of a podcast, of newsletters and writing and essentially opinions that were not given the proper platform or credibility in legacy media at that time. And it turns out that a lot of people are actually interested in that and gathered around that work and wanted to produce things similar to it. So now we have these communities that are gathered through discord and RSS feeds and a few places here and there. And the question is, what are these things going to evolve into some type of parent institutional space is actually a term I picked up from you. You've been tremendously influential in like setting a narrative frame for how to understand these things in the last few years. But before we get too far into this, let me ask you about this period in 2017, I was having private closed doors conversations with people who worked at think tanks, who were consultants, people who were political journalists, all sorts of things. And it was tremendously unpopular to discuss some of these topics at that time, right? Around that time, 2017, what are these early conversations that then lead to founding new models a year later? Right. I mean, just to touch on something you said there, until really Trump's election or let's say 2014-15, most people in left adjacent spaces or culture adjacent spaces had this idea that the internet was a progressive space, that the internet and that social media that Web2 platforms were a democratizing space. But you have during the Obama administration, an alignment of mass pop culture, proto-web two social media and governmental agencies, allowing no space for dissent, except for on the right. And these right wing spaces become spaces of dissent or of questioning. And of course, in some cases, it's taken very far into absolutely like on tolerant and corrosive. But it was kind of the only space of critique that was available. So this space became pretty interesting. Any space that was outside of the social media industrial complex or whatever you'd want to call it. Around 2014 or 15, people were starting to see that system break and negative effects on the way we absorb media, on the way we talk to each other, on the kind of conversations we can have. Kevin, the political scientist Kevin Munger, who is in both of our communities, he's done a lot of work on this and we'll quite clearly say that the physics of social media make 20th century discourse impossible. And so anybody though, anybody who is questioning the way social media worked or the strength of legacy media was seen as maybe working for the other side. And it was very frustrating because you couldn't find a space outside of the clearly available channels. So when we started new models, I mean, that idea had been in the works certainly throughout 2017. And it really started because there were some artists that were dealing with memes in 2016 and the art world was very nervous about that. But it really blew up. Like the idea that someone would put a pepe in the show was like somebody like spray painting swastikas, like, you know, in a school or something. It was a very, it felt like a very strong message for some people. There really wasn't any space to debate this. It was like as soon as you were, as soon as you weren't condemning it, you were part of the problem. At the time I was working for the Berlin-based critical art journal, Texas De Kunst. And I was very interested in this medium of memes. I figured that, you know, in the lineage of Diss and other younger artists at the time who were thinking about digital culture and the way that was changing, the way we communicate through symbols, I thought we should be looking at memes. And we should be looking at meme culture and we should be speaking to artists that are interested in this conversation. And this was just not tolerated by the publisher and she felt like it was liability. She's from Gen X basically and that generation still very much believed in linear media. Yes, books and print magazines, but like a slower pace of media, which is also fine. I mean, I respect that also. That's their culture. That's their generation. That's how they communicate. That's the medium in which they work. But of course, for younger generations, that was no longer true. And I just realized that I can't force this publication to do something that it doesn't want to do. So the burden that our generation has to carry or maybe the opportunity we have is to explore new forms of media, explore new structures. And if we don't build it, then who will? Like meta or I guess at the time Facebook, you know, we might as well try. And as culture adjacent people, like, why not? If not us, then who, right? So it was a very freeing moment because it was one where you decide voices no longer possible. I must choose exit. Once that decision is sort of apparent, then you have the confidence to just either you're going to go down with the ship or else you're going to jump. So yeah, making the decision to exit is often difficult. And it's usually a one way trip. Like when I turn down the offer to teach it, RISD, to do this full time, you don't get an invitation the next year. So this is a pretty risky scenario. And being a few years into this project now, it's become very clear. I think that it's really not possible to crowdfund meaningful art criticism. If it was possible to crack, I think someone would have cracked it already. There's been a few different attempts at that. But the things that get closest to it is new models, interdependence, my channel, but we all have one foot in art and then one foot in this other world. So for me, it's memes, radical politics, internet, culture, phenomena. For new models, it's maybe the newsfeed and for interdependence. It's tech fields like AI and crypto and so on. But it doesn't really seem possible. I put a lot of thought into this. It doesn't really seem possible to crowdfund art criticism. 100% the dedication, the topic that your publication is focused on simply because there's just not enough people in the fucking art world. Like it is actually really small. So I see a lot of discontent. I see a lot of discontent from people who are trapped in these legacy media structures. But because there's no possibility to fully exit from that system, they're kind of trolling back and forth on the deck of a sinking ship. And you see people who are like, they're beholden to these institutional decisions and preferences and like weird ideological priorities in the past few years. But essentially all of that criticism is at its core meaningless because there's no way for them to actually exit because they can't sustain themselves. So they are like totally trapped to these things. And what you get is basically a culture of people and a system of values within the art world and within legacy media where they're beholden to those decisions and they attend exhibitions or they read articles and print or whatever it happens to be. Not because they really like the stuff that's on the wall or the stuff that's in the article, but they're envious of the people who have those positions. And there's nothing they can do about it. And so there's just this through the whole system, this ideological Stockholm syndrome that like, okay, I guess what is put on the wall here makes sense. And our job in reaction to this problem in the legacy media world is that we're trying to value things absent their market price and absent their institutional credibility because we tend to think that both of those things have pretty severe problems that are evidence and dysfunctional at this moment. Yeah. I mean, I would even go, I am running with this idea lately that our conception of an art world is tied to the existence of linear media. And if you go back to, you know, I know Habermost is a very problematic figure, but if you go back to his description of the public sphere, you know, the rise of the modern public sphere is like early 18th century. So I forget exactly when the Paris salon started, but let's say like sometime around 1726 or something like that, right? All before the French Revolution, but what that did is it took people of all different classes and it allowed them to share a physical space viewing whatever was coming out of the equal to Bozar or whatever, you know, painters, mostly painters, some sculptors that had some kind of cultural prominence. So okay, so that's one thing. You have people of various different class backgrounds coming together in an urban center in a physical space, looking at these works which have, you know, have already have some layer of cultural value to even make it into the Paris salon. There's a judging process, right? So so there's already like something valuable on the wall that people are supposed to collectively discuss, but that's only part of it because you have all these different kinds of people in a space together dressed in all these different ways, physically like, you know, brushing elbows with each other, you then have a class of journalists, which pops up. And they're very interested in the spectacle of the salon. Yes, they're interested in talking about the paintings, but they're really interested in seeing how different classes are interacting and how different classes are reacting. Like always the bourgeoisie offended by this do like the sort of young bohemians, if we can already call them that in the 18th century, maybe that's like a historical, but you know, do they like it? The art is just a litmus test for how different classes, like what power they really have in society. It's less about the art than it is about how these different groups of people are able to respond to what's there. So this starts art criticism. I think one could argue it was more about the reading of different cultural groups than it was even about the painting. And the painting was only valuable in so far as it stimulated different kinds of conflicts among these different groups. So this is a super interesting moment, right? But it requires linear media because it requires everyone's attention to be able to be focused on certain critics, certain publications. There's like a timeline to when something is released. Then there's a moment of wonder and discussion and debate. Then the critic writes a review. Then the review comes out. Then people argue about whether or not the review is right or it's wrong or it's scandalous. And so this is a rhythm. It's a rhythm just like Monday Night Football is a rhythm and then there's a super bowl. And it's a rhythm that like all these different people of all these different classes or anyone who's tuning into the media is able to sink on. So it's very important, I think, in the conception of modernism. But we see a dissolution of anyone caring about art when we see the dissolution of linear media because I think we see a dissolution of the public sphere. And you'll hear like whatever Elon saying, Twitter's a town hall or whatever or web two media is a common space. I mean, it's just not. It's not a public sphere. Right. It's not a common space. Focusing in sane libertarian frothing nonsense. Oh my god. Yeah, exactly. It's not. I mean, it's like it's just not and we can talk later about like some maybe some models for what social media is and where there might be some semblance of a public sphere. But it's not in any of our main channels of media. So my feeling is that like individual artists are making interesting things in relation to certain discourses that are external to the art world. But like art criticism is an interesting as its own discourse because it doesn't share a room anymore. They're not in the same space. It doesn't share a society. I would say as late as 2012. I mean, this is kind of the cutoff. You still had that semblance of like common group. And it was very global one by 2012, which is interesting. I mean, we went in the arts with the internet. We were able to have a global scope. And there were biennials all over the world. And there was an interest in sort of these large exhibitions that brought everyone together. But around 2012, you start to see that dissolve. And I just don't think the art world as an entity is interesting because it's not in the same room. Everyone's living in a hostel now or something as opposed to a grand hotel. There's no really good common space. So I'm not actually interested in defending spaces purely about art criticism. Maybe that will make sense in the future. And I hope it does because I really have enjoyed that kind of media historically. But I think that now they will be adjacent. There will be a discourse adjacent to what's happening in AI say that for sure will be one. There will be one maybe that is adjacent to questions of migration and displacement of people's and different cultures coming together. I think they're going to be disciplines specific worlds where art criticism will play a role. But that's sort of the shift that I think that we're accepting. So yeah, there's no crowdfunding for art criticism because outside of an enclave, like dime square could maybe have like a self-funded art critical newspaper. But on a larger scale, I don't think it's possible. They definitely have a dad-funded art critical news. Okay. Seems to be a lot of bad going on. Or shield funded. Yeah. Let me ask you about this question of 2012 though because that's a really important inflection point. And I think we've touched on this in a few different conversations. If you look at the adoption curve of social media, 2012 is when like, it's not just you and your friends from college. It's like your mom, dad, aunt, and uncle. And everybody you know is on Facebook. There's just this like big network effect and like uptick of monthly active users. That seems to correlate with this dissolution of the public sphere. But at that time, you're still in New York. Is that correct? You're at art form at that time. Yeah. And I'm kind of curious if like, because you really do have a background in as you described it here, linear media, which I'm taking to mean like a monthly publication, a quarterly publication. There's like opinions, critical discourse. And that frequency, that regularity sets the pace and also creates like shared references across the community. But then when you switch over to the newsfeed and then it becomes literally not chronological anymore as the newsfeed is optimized to engage more users. So if we're spanning this period, maybe you could reconstitute for some of our younger listeners who are literally 19, 20 years old. They're interested in creative life, but they don't have the same experience that we came from. They didn't see the world before social media. They didn't see the world before the internet, you know, even web one. So what was the thing that changed? What changed in the priorities of the editors and just the experience of encountering culture through these linear publications? I mean, I would say in 2012, editors at art forum and other adjacent publications still believed that despite there being this large uptick of adoption of social media, that at the end of the day, these papers of record, these established publications still had more clout. Still were the ones that mattered. They still were the ones that accorded value to something. And so while all the editors were also consuming social media and participating in this, especially anyone who was younger than, say, 40 or something at the time was, there was a little bit of denial that, well, we're going to have these two tracks where social media will continue, but the content for social media will still be primarily generated by legacy media. I mean, I like to think about it as like, the image in my head is a Blencanny and damn or something. Think of any kind of major hydroelectric dam. And there's like a PowerPoint. There's like a literal PowerPoint. And you need a repository of lady content, water, on one side of it. And it needs to have some kind of altitude drop in order to generate power. And you're just seeing all that content now evaporate. I mean, it really is just like, you know, an image at West before or be re-rooted, right? And being re-absorbed into the ground or being re-rooted to avocado, plantations or whatever, before it reaches that dam. So there's just not that pressure, not that power that's coming downstream. But in the 2012 editor's mind of, say, art for myself included, you're like, yeah, but our water is special. So the water that makes it through the dam is like, you know, really good stuff. So like, who cares if some of it like burns authors, we still have the good stuff coming through. And I think we believed at that moment that especially in the art sector, there would still be say philanthropic means or there would still be, it would be a vanity thing to support these magazines. And so they would still continue because the community that they create was valuable enough that this would be prioritized by people who had means to support these things. So that was really, yeah, that was really the feeling. Like you knew something was shifting, but you felt especially in the culture sector that maybe you offered something special, total delusion. And I think it really wasn't until 2014 for me. I think others, especially those who are working at like non-culture adjacent media definitely felt this earlier. Yeah, I would say that most people in the publishing world had this revelation sometime in the early teens. I think there's a few milestones in this where there's a very clear, large portion of culture that's happening online that's just not represented in legacy media for a whole variety of reasons. But something begins to happen around like 2015, 2016 as all of like American pop culture is just subsumed into social media, just devours everyone's attention. It becomes incredibly conspicuous. Like it's just your experience of scrolling your newsfeed every day versus linear media is like there's a tremendous disparity, right? So things start to open up. There's just like a wedge of attention and interest that seems to divorce all media and the online experience from legacy media and linear publications and so on. But oddly enough, there's like no attempt to like, oh, we are lagging behind. We should try and catch up with this runaway story that we're now late to approach. And so what starts to happen is that the way that legacy publications react to it is in this super reactionary way where if you think about it from a purely business perspective, it is actually a threat to their profits that their readership is now moving elsewhere. So of course, on top of all of the questionable political commitments that some of these alt media people have, there's just a clear business competition thing where you have to kind of disparage the guy who makes Pepsi versus the guy who makes Coke, even if they're selling you the same experience through an article. And I feel like in 2018, there was this moment, it was a 2018 issue of art forum that contained gritty this sports mask on from Philadelphia, the hockey. Yes. So for a very brief period, like I think it was started by the Philly DSA and it was put into a lot of memes that was going to be the mascot or the icon for the left and what happened. Total force. And it was, it did not work very well. But people were, they were trying to push something and the art world was really at this point so overdue to respond. They couldn't not make some kind of commentary about it. So in 2018, there's an issue of art forum that ends up with gritty on the cover. I went back in advance of this podcast episode looking for some of your previous writing and you made a list of recommendations that included, I think, of the final 10 recommendations. The last one was come town in 2018. Do you remember that? I do. I do. I do. I do. I do. I do. I do. I do. I do. I do. I do. I do. I do. I do. I do. Yeah. But at that point, it's kind of like, it's kind of too late for the art world. I was hopeful that moment that this was an indication that was at the same time I wrote the book. There was some rhizome projects that were really high quality happening at that time. But yeah, the art world just kind of decided that we're going to permanently ignore everything that's happening online and we are just our own kind of sovereign inward facing whatever. So a bit disappointed and then it begins to make sense from that perspective why certain people tend to exit and start their own publications, their own news feeds and content stream. For sure. I mean, then there's, I mean, this term is like an IDW term, but there is definitely like audience capture that's happening or woke capture that's happening in these legacy publications. There's sort of two things that happen around 2014, I want to say. One is legacy media knows the only way it's going to drive new eyeballs is through writers who have strong social media followings. And so you're going to have writers with strong social media followings prioritized over those more nuanced writers, which is going to limit the kinds of takes they're going to get to those that are popular on social media. They kind of made their own bed, didn't they? They did. Yeah. Because picking people who had big social media followings I could push traffic, those people could also just start their own sub stacks and they could really exit. Like that's true journalism writing has like a built in audience that's much larger than art criticism. So for publications like the Atlantic, the New York Times, Washington Post, like these big legacy publications, there's also pretty clear financial incentives for a lot of people to make a leap and actually earn a better living publishing on their own platform that we've seen play in the past few years. I mean, that's absolutely true. And you see that migration happened around like 2018, 19, definitely during COVID is when you really see that happen. But like let's also remember that a top publication in 1968 would pay what in today's currency equals around $10 a word for a major feature, right? That's a substance. You write two features a year in your set. You can have a middle class life and send your kid to school. And then 1980s, a condinast, Tina Brown famously made the $2 award, which seemed like a lot of money. It would be like equivalent to $6 a word now. And that seemed like yeah, you could again, you could write maybe three features a year and you could like have a decent life. On average, the Guardian, for instance, or most publications, they pay on average around 25 cents a word now, right? That means that you would roughly need to write one 650, 700 word piece every single the day of the year to bring in a salary of like, you know, gross around 50 K. 50 K is not nothing, but nobody's writing a guardian article every single day, right? It's just not possible in order to, you know, to research it. It's not sustainable, let alone living in like a major urban center and having a family. It's not an adult job. It can't be taken seriously. It's not a real financial model. So you see this like, you know, this total implosion of the value of like what writers are doing, but I'm getting a little ahead of myself because if we go back to say 2014, we don't yet have the sub-stack option. Most people aren't really thinking in terms of like the creator economy yet. So if I speak specifically about the culture sector, because that's what I know, you have legacy publications that are seeking younger writers with large social media followings because they will know they know it will help their own numbers. It will help their own clicks, but they're very nervous about being associated with anybody who's edgy online specifically noting this alliance between say the government and corporate culture and social media and anyone who doesn't have the narrative like, wow, social media is a democratizing force isn't great. It's like allowing everybody to have a voice. So you see culture sector media choose people who their edge is in a very particular angle. People who want to like speak truth to power. People who want to protest. You know, and sometimes these are very legitimate things. I mean, like there is a lot of good change that did happen from, you know, some of the woke energy from the teens. It's not like totally terrible, but you see a very particular kind of edgy internet writer the energy spaces. An audience comes with that. An audience who doesn't want to see incoherence in legacy media wants to make sure that the language is right, like defund abolish and there's not a lot of wiggle room. So by 2016, 17, 18, these legacy media publications are reliant on figures and audience that is they have a very actually a very narrow political outlook. They really don't want anything that threatens it. They end up with a greedy on the cover of art form in 2018 because he's like this safe meme character that doesn't offend people who are like more woke aligned in 2018. And so I really think they dug their own grave there. They were audience captured. The recent capture of institutional priorities with this disparity ideology, they've kind of put the cart in front of the horse because if you're paying people 25 cents a word in legacy media and then also similar rates for adjunct professors and cultural institutions in general. The only people who can afford to do that work are those who have access to intergenerational wealth. It has to be subsidized from somewhere and we don't have the social democratic basis of society to subsidize people's creative pursuits. So you end up with incredibly wealthy privileged people who have these very radical politics that are actually impossible to realize within the frameworks of those institutions because they are dependent on billionaire philanthropic donors. So it kind of creates this perfect push and pull contradiction that keeps the thing in motion. And actually, I think I'm paraphrasing from Angela Nagel here, but the liberals have done incredible work to synthesize the most extreme elements of either of their adversaries, both on the left and on the right, that you see the most unprecedented ruthless austerity that's ever taken place in the history of civilized society. And then you see this incredible woke rhetoric where are we really supposed to believe that any of these hedge funds care about settler colonialists? I give me a question. Right. Right. This is nonsense. And I mean, also, as you mentioned before with the kind of rigor around some of these political phrases, I do have to say that defund and abolish are categorically the most unpopular political phrases, period. You just look at voter turnout and polling responses like people don't want that, especially working class people. They want more police because they're at risk in their neighborhoods. These are things that are appealing to people who have come from elite universities who live in, let's be honest, like extremely segregated lives in universities, cultural institutions in elite fancy neighborhoods. And their priorities tend to cascade onto everyone else and because of lack of opportunity and ability to exit, we're kind of stuck having to toe the line on a lot of these rhetorical topics that are largely broadly unpopular. So let's take this question of exit seriously. You've kind of outlined the problems with legacy media, with cultural institutions and like elite structures of all the problems with editors and curators and what have you. But you make this leap. Now you're out on your own platform. It seems like there's a whole different terrain that then takes place in this sort of media where if you were trying to do, just entertain the counter narrative, if you were trying to do the rigorous work that you could infrequently, but sometimes publish through linear media, that stuff just absolutely sinks. Thanks to the bottom of the news feed. And so what you find is that you have to kind of pander to celebrity. You have to attach your essay to a sexy selfie. You have to do all types of like kind of clickbait, prank video, silly tricks for titling and grabbing people's attention. And it just feels like the opportunities are increasingly few that you can get quality stuff out there. So I think new models, interdependence, I would say my channel is what like we make a very rigorous attempt to try and produce quality work, but we are very small channels. That's right. I think we have quality of reach that there's people who are, for example, curators or editors of major magazines that listen very closely to the topics we talk about, but we don't have a wide reach. You know, none of this is like Logan Paul or any of these characters, you know, much, much smaller. So I wonder if in your experience the last few years, say like 2018 to now, you've been publishing on your own platform, are there things that you miss about the legacy media structure that like you're putting together a podcast or newsletters or something and you're like, you know, I can't publish that in this format. I have to make this kick up in the newsfeed. It's got to perform well. I have to optimize for views and I have to hook people in like the first sentence or they're going to click through the next thing. I would actually say the opposite is kind of true for new models in terms of feeling limited. When publishing with text sequenced or publishing with art forum, there was this particular like higher brow audience that I imagined, right? There was a certain level of like scholarship or academic rigor that I felt or, you know, the editors around me also enforced. I think it's good. These magazines have certain reputations. You know, I don't know if that's true necessarily anymore. That was the feeling like circa 2014. With new models, one, I mean, we'd love to scale, but we don't want to scale at the expense of losing a more dedicated focused audience and ourselves becoming audience captured to somebody who is going to unsubscribe immediately if we're not like publishing something that's like super fun every single minute. I actually found it more liberating because our audience is in a way broader. They're not art specialists. They're some who are, but we also have technologists. We also have people who do things that are totally unrelated to maybe tech and culture. Maybe they're just like into weird internet stuff and our specialists for in forestry or other kinds of things. And so I felt like it was okay to unpack things in really simple ways. Like I didn't feel like we were being dumb if we asked someone to explain a term or we felt like we were having to create a new canon. We had to create a new glossary, a new vocabulary. And so I actually felt, past five years have felt very intuitive the way we've built our content. Of course, some things work and some things don't work and you kind of just say, okay, note it and move on. But I really don't feel like we're trapped by our audience whatsoever. I will say though that both Julian and I, we do other work in addition to new models in order to support ourselves. So we've made that choice that we weren't going to put all the weight on the podcast and the channel that we were going to continue to take commercial jobs and other kinds of things that would subsidize it. We also live in Berlin on an old rental contract, which allows us to like live a really, you know, pretty simple life. But having a family and these other kinds of aspirations changes that equation. And I don't know if you were to ask me in a year or two if I'd have the same exact answer. But I am curious Josh how it's affected you because you do have this more specialized content, which I mean your project would fall apart if you diluted it. It's valuable specifically because you're the one person who's actually going there and doing this research. I like to think of art as the professional field that doesn't have to abide by the disciplines of any other field. I think the art world in general is a really effective petri dish for like de-risking cultural innovation that you have these spaces where people can meet up and then very interesting, very influential projects spawn later on. I'm thinking of a few artists in particular and I'm thinking of a few podcasts with reaches that are much, much larger than ours. All of those things have roots in the art world and in these like weird cultural spaces that just couldn't happen anywhere else. If you were purely a journalist, you'd be subject to rigorous fact-checking and you wouldn't be able to make data, agnostic, trend forecasting statements in public. But being attached to an arts institution, you can say, okay, this person has some kind of legitimacy, credible foresight or would have you. I guess this is kind of the bind is that the strength of the art world in particular is its flexibility. And unfortunately, the force, the push to professionalization drains some of that flexibility and makes it more brittle in a way. Yeah, I feel like my hope for the channel in particular is that at the end of all of this, DNR can be its own self-standing 501C3 non-profit arts organization that like publishes people's work, which we do that more frequently than most art magazines now, just in a quantitative sense. And then there's just as we talked about in the past few minutes on the podcast, there's a severe lack of reporting and quality work dedicated to these subjects, which are very obviously important. This is probably a year ago now, but this example really stuck with me. I was in, maybe I won't say where I was because then it'll be obvious who the person is. Norman City, fuck, everyone's going to know who I'm talking about. But there's a very influential artist. This is somebody who I looked up to and modeled my career after. This was like, I was so, I don't know, honored to be included in an exhibition with this person. This is one of the people that I really looked up to. Ten years older than me, set the narrative, set the aesthetic for a generation, incredibly brilliant artist. And we're having this talk and we're kind of riffing on Patreon and we're riffing on collectors and whatever. And I'm like, is this guy, is he making fun of me? Is he like making fun of me as a failed artist because I had to like do crowdfunding or whatever? And then he keeps asking about it. Like he keeps asking and it's all the sudden it dawns on me that this guy is really interested in crowdfunding. And he says, you guys found a way out that he feels trapped in the institution at the height of his success. The guy that I tried to model my career after is like, damn, you guys got his name. He figured out and I'm like, bro, we're on like supercarious. You're subject to the wins of the algorithm and like the news feed. It's like this is not a way out. We're trying to survive. But to see that from the opposite side, I don't know, it told me, it told me something about the whole project. So yeah, I guess, I have a particular set of interests, but like there is a different end game that I think I have in mind. The big arc of this is that in the periods that we're describing, let's say just roughly 2012 to we're now in 2023, like in that 10 year arc, there's a massive decline of the middle class and mid to your galleries, some of which you used to work at and you know this experience very well. And the problem is that there's a whole bunch of talented young people who just literally don't have spaces and resources to show their work. And so I kind of imagine new models and do not research as being like these makeshift creative incubators for people to learn a set of references, have a built in audience, refine their work in the early era of Facebook. We were kind of posting things to our friends and then you would have a like a discourse through the common threads and like exchange messages. And then you built towards a consensus idea and that was a much more vibrant discourse. And I think it was a lot more fulfilling for a lot of people. So I'm hopeful that like through this process of gathering digital communities and sending out this strong signal, we can rebuild some of those. Those opportunities and maybe that takes the shape of becoming a nonprofit or something else. I guess the rest is to be determined. But I guess maybe let me throw this to you because I'm curious about I know very well like New York is an ecosystem of just scrappy projects bases right now. There's basically giant blue chip beyond you know, House or whatever. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Pace, house or in worth, David Zwerner, the gochelle and these things. Yeah. Absolutely dominated, overwhelming domination in the market. And then there's just this enormous archipelago of scrappy projects bases. So I see kids kind of like ping ponging back and forth, but not really gathering anywhere for too long. Is it a similar situation in Berlin or is it still possible to kind of to go there, be a little bit aimless for a few years, feel things out and find your community, you know, a bootstrapped. That was a new real estate. No. But I mean, actually, I mean, I want to come back to a couple of things you said. They said a bunch of interesting things. One question that I'd actually like to ask that maybe can animate this question regarding spaces for younger people to be making art, showing art or whatnot is what era of media is coming next. And this is a question that my partner, Lil Internet and new models, we've been thinking about a lot. We know that Web2 media is afterfeiting. It's increasingly inefficient. And in my mind, it's like an interstate highway that like has like annoying toll booths and like has like really shitty travel plazas filled with billboards and the poster like the billboards. All it does is like send you to different exit ramps to visit the spaces that it advertises and then some maybe are going to be satisfying community enclaves and others are going to be purely functional and others are going to be terrible or whatever. And so I think our conception of social media is changing. Therefore, I think our conception of some kind of shared media is going to change as well. So just putting that out there as like an animator and a question of like what era of media is coming next. In my mind, it has to do in part with this phenomenon of if we keep it in art world context, a lot of these mega galleries now have their own publications where they can pay writers with PhDs, working salaries to write good essays about important canonical art figures, right? I don't know what the readership necessarily is for these magazines, but the economic model is in place for some kind of media to be produced. And people who care about say, how's our in words or is one or whatever, they will at least look at the magazine because they want some association with that world. They want to understand the habitus of this world. If they are aspiring collectors, they're absolutely going to study it because they want to get an in so that they can get the good pieces. If they're a younger artist who's interested in the artist, this gallery shows, they too may be interested because here is the aggregator of like those references that this gallery thinks is important. You see this also in fashion. You see this with say essence, you see this with high snobiety. I mean, to be honest, I went down a rabbit hole and there's numerous sites that are built on the essence model. Aggregating small labels that probably don't even have retail spaces, they are editorializing collections. I mean, I'm not going to say that the writing is fantastic, but there's at least some inspiration behind it. And they are some kind of common space for different creative sectors, right? So I see that there's this new form of media that's evolving and I have to do a lot more thinking and research, but I don't know if the mid-tier gallery is so necessary. Any more. I think that the majority of artists, and I'm sure there are people listening who will really disagree with this and that's fine. I'm curious to hear those opinions also, but in my experience, watching people's careers develop, you have young artists who do stuff at project spaces and maybe they have one or two really cool shows or do some cool things and then their path takes them elsewhere. Maybe they end up working in film or they end up in architecture or something. Well I don't know, else completely forestry, whatever. Then you have some who skyrocket, like you know, your every singers, those who spend very little time in the mid section. They sort of come out of school, do a few shows and then suddenly they have a big gallery behind them. Those artists that remain in the middle, that middle ground, it's almost more for the galleries that have the potential to move up to sub-blue chip or like let's say sub-blue chip and blue chip are kind of the same. Let's say it's not just the big four, let's say a big five. Let's say there's like that tier, then there's a tier that's like just slightly lower, that also services like, that's a pretty good turnaround every single year. I wonder if the mid tier gallery still serves the same purpose. As a place of de-vertualization, it's important. But as a necessary stepping stone, I wonder if it's not just like a shadow of Gen X or something, I wonder if like those mid, I've heard more horror stories about mid tier galleries, that take work and sell it, but then tell the artist, well, they're all these production costs and also we're waiting to get paid, et cetera. I mean, there's so much angst that's like... I know that very well. Yes. Yeah, I mean, everybody who's shown these spaces has a story and I kind of understand it. I mean, real estate's really expensive. Going to art fairs is really expensive. That business model for the mid tier gallery is really hard. But I wonder if it's just not even that necessary. I mean, to answer your question, Berlin does have mid tier galleries and they do work. And I think the economic structure of Berlin is different. Berlin's kind of like the countryside. I mean, it's not like a big city the way that New York or London is, right? It's milder. The whole thing is milder. And I just... I think there might be other pathways for that mid section, perhaps. I wish sometimes that we had actually crossed paths in the art world in 2012 before we ended up leaving New York. I know. It's surprising that that hadn't happened because I did meet coincidentally Julian on a trip to Boston forever ago. This was a jogging exhibition in actually literally 2012 at the Mass Art with Brad and the whole jogging crew. This is way back when. But yeah, in that time, you have been just such a tremendously influential, literally an influential voice and that I hear you on the podcast. But also through your writing and your conceptual framing of all these issues. And I just couldn't be more grateful for your work. So if you listen to this podcast, if you enjoy this content, I strongly encourage you to listen to new models. Subscribe on Patreon, substack, newmodels.io is literally my homepage. People who watch the stream will notice when I refresh or open a new tab, open to new models that I owe, which is how the drug report did it. It actually is because of the piece from Documents Journal right now. Yeah, yeah. And Carly was the editor on irony politics in Gen Z, which is going to be pushed out through the substack. We did this back in 2019, no. That's crazy. That's right. Yeah. A few TED talks and a few interesting citations. Yeah, it's been a wild ride. Anyway, Carly, thank you so much for joining me today. I am immensely indebted to your content and your influence in the past few years. Thank you so much for coming on. Where can people find you aside from the platforms I mentioned and what stuff should people look out for in the near future? Well, let's see. I mean, we are working on a talk for a human bizarre for Art Dubai that is hopefully going to animate what, you know, the next era of media will be. This is really the, like, I feel like a few years ago we were thinking about what are these structures that are starting to develop outside of ClearNet. Then it was like, okay, let's talk about the progression of media from linear to nonlinear or holographic. And now the question is really, all right, but like, what now is the next era of media? Like, where do we see this going? We will be giving that talk in the first week of March. And I imagine we'll have some stuff coming out after that that maybe give some clues as to where to look next. Otherwise, newmodels.io and channel.xyz. That's our joint project with interdependence, Joshua Cedarella, new models. So pleasure being on, Josh. Thank you so much for the time and for the plunge. Thanks, Carly. More again soon.

      "episode": "The Spin-Off Doctors Tomb Raider 2018.txt",
      "text": "Okay, so we're talking about a quiet place, the movie before we talk about Tomb Raider. I don't think it's particularly spoilery, but I do go into some a bit of detail about the film, not a great deal, just I don't know, you never know what to spoil of these days, so just consider this a warning, I suppose, anyway, on with the thing. I watch that quiet place, Conrad. That quiet place, that's the one with the people that have to be quiet or the aliens eat them. They got to be quiet because otherwise the bad shit will happen. In furiating film, I've been looking for creepy films because I watch the lake mongo and I'm like I need more of that. So I ask for it for recommendations. I've gone through a lot of them, only a few of them have been very good. They've been all right. Eden Lake was fucking scary. Mostly angry, not at the movie at the situation. Well worth checking out Eden Lake, but you've got to steal the stomach for it. Not even because it's particularly grotesque, it's more thematically upsetting, especially because it's very believable. That's all I'll say about that. A quiet place though, I don't know how they survived. I don't know how they lasted more than three days. They are all universally stupid. People have to be a bit stupid in horror and room if it's for some of them to work. You know, you'll laugh at that. Why didn't you get out the house? Why are you going on your own out there? It's et cetera, et cetera. Don't go in the basement. Yeah. Yeah, but because of this movie's gimmick and it is a gimmick, the only way you can create drama, or certainly the only way they create a drama is either an accident that makes a loud noise or them doing something stupid that makes a loud noise. So what we get is a full-on movie full of nothing but idiotic accidents. And that's it for the movie. And they get out of every idiotic accident through dumb luck. It's always coincidence, convenience that they escape trouble. And it was exasperating. And don't have a baby. Don't have a baby. If you're in that situation. And certainly if you've got to raise it in a jigsaw trap. They have a baby? Yeah, they have an a baby and they make a box for it so it doesn't make noise and with an oxygen mask and stuff. And I'm like, so that baby's growing up, fucked up. Oh yeah, he's going to be totally normal. Totally normal. I don't want to say too much about the movie for a fear of spoiling it and whatnot. It's a fairly recent film. But all of that stuff that I've said is, you know, you could see that from trailers and shit. But my god, it's nothing but idiotic mistake after idiotic mistake. Inconceivably stupid. And babies are incapable of being quiet. And that, yeah, I mean that. But of course because this movie is about convenience and dumb luck. It only cries when they need a tense scene to happen. Otherwise it's the most well-behaved baby in human history. Yeah. Yes, and it is. It is the most well-behaved baby I've ever seen ever. In order for the movie to work. And my god, the conclusion, it ends up so obvious and so there is no way this was discovered by accident. You know, there's no way they wouldn't have worked something out that's what exactly at the end of the film. They defigured that out on day one of the event that happened happening. I, I, okay, I think I've already figured it out. You probably have. I'm pretty sure I figured it out. I can't help but think that there's a potential strength because there's a weakness thing here. Well, stupid fucking idiots. Well, there's nothing like idiots. I would have been killed immediately because I can't keep my god damn mouth shut. Oh yeah, yeah, I'm not saying I'd have survived. I wouldn't have lasted a week. Here's the thing, the protagonist. No would die. Really? Fucking idiots. If they'd wanted to do this proper, they should have set it around a monastery. Yes, right. Yeah, but there's another thing they point out. Where like, there's somewhere they can go that's safe because of a reason. And I'm thinking the whole time, why aren't you living there? Why aren't you living there? Oh, that's right because you're the kind of stupid idiot that doesn't put the fucking toy up higher. It starts with idiots and it ends with idiots. A quiet place. And the real frustration is it's got a fucking amazing monster in it and there are great scenes and really cool little moments and it is a neat gimmick for a film. You know, this low dialogue we got to all be quiet because of the thing. It's very interesting. That concept has a lot of legs. But you know, maybe it's just because I never really were I was never interested in having kids. So I cannot sympathize with this need to have children. Like it was the same with the walking dead like Alex was always frustrated with the walking dead for that reason. It's like, oh, we've got a further the species. First of all, arrogant. Second of all, deal with the crisis first. Make sure you're not basically giving birth to a millstone. Yeah. That makes sense. Because you're not furthering the species if you're giving birth to something that will get all of you killed. It's just so I couldn't care about that. And like I said, it it was like the cast of police academy that were making so many stupid mistakes. At one point I laughed. At one point I was laughing during a so called tense scene because I couldn't believe they could get any stupider and they did. But that's the way the film has to work in order for the scenes to happen. There was one moment where there was an external problem to deal with. And that was the best scene in the film. Everything else they do it to themselves. And I no longer in that movie then because I don't care if they live or die. It's better for them to die. Anyway, we saw Tomb Raider. Yeah. So what are we going to watch next time? Right. Yeah. We're going to watch a chasing ghost. We are going to watch chasing ghosts. We normally don't say that till the end. But we will do it. But now that we've spent seven minutes talking about another movie. Well, I mean, you know, where else do I talk about it? I have to talk about it on pod position and I probably will again. I won't talk about a quiet place again. But, you know, we talk a little bit off topic stuff there. But this is a movie podcast. It's true. Another big good time to express my deep sensations with a quiet place. God, that bad ass monster's in it. Yeah. That's unfortunate. That's a bad thing. My only exposure to it was the Saturday Night Live sketch that came out when Kanye was all over the place. And the premise of the sketch was that they were in, you know, the setting of a quiet place. But they're all like reacting to tweets from Kanye. And the shit Kanye is doing and are unable to like prevent themselves from screaming aloud at how weird it all is. Yeah. And I thought, okay, cool. I get it. I don't need to see the movie now. I get it. Honestly, honestly, that's cleverer than what they were doing in a quiet place. That's unfortunate. In terms of the characters. Yeah. Although the sketch was quite clever as well from the sounds of it. But reacting to Kanye tweets is a lot less stupid than what some of these idiots were doing. These blithering fools. Well speaking of blithering fools, we watch Tomb Raider. Yes. Yes. We're the fucking Marx here because we sat through Tomb Raider. It's not bad. It's not bad. It's not bad. It's a really competent movie. That's exactly the way I was watching it. And I was like, can't, Conrad is going to call this movie competent. And it won't be entirely a compliment to the film. It's not bad. I know I just said that, but I don't know what else to say. But it's also, you have to say it with that hesitation of I don't have anything particularly good to say about it either. I mean, I'm always happy to see Walton Goggins get a gig. Walton Goggins? Yeah. He was the villain of this. Oh, oh, oh, oh, the gameplay's vocal. Okay. Yes. Yeah. I don't know. I'm always happy to see Dominic West working. Yeah. Yeah. I keep trying to place him from something. I know he was in 300, but I'm sure I've seen him in something else. Oh, he was in the wire. Did you watch the wire? No, although I know I've got to see it. Like everyone says you have to see it. He's fucking amazing in the wire, because like that's where I know him primarily from. And probably wouldn't, you know, I would maybe recognize him in other things once I saw him. But my context for Dominic West is the character of Jimmy McNulty, who is from Baltimore and has a fucking perfect Baltimore accent. Fucking perfect. So to hear him speak in his normal tone and and and form of speech in this film as a British man was surprising. It took me a second. I didn't recognize him immediately as I thought I might have because my context for him was this British voice. And I see the photo and it wasn't until like the midpoint of the film that I realized, oh shit. That's Jimmy McNulty. Yeah. So that was surprising. Yeah. There's there's good stuff here. They actually playing Lara. Oh, yeah. It's a good Lara. I don't think we're much to do. Doesn't get a chance to be really all that good. The one thing I kept thinking watching this film was this is based on the rebooted Tomb Raider series. You know, we've got a shadow of the Tomb Raider coming out very, very soon, except 10th or 14th I believe. So very soon. I was recently replaying Rise of the Tomb Raider. That's an amazing little concept. That's an amazing little product because it's a really good game. Really, really good that you cannot remember. It's like the Nosferatu have like put an obvious gate spell on it because I play it, enjoy it a lot. And I only remember that I liked it. I can't remember the fucking content. And that is the ultimate replay about you. Yes. It's new every time. But what I found interesting and what I kept thinking about with this film was those reboots primarily happened to not just do another Tomb Raider. You know, the original Tomb Raiders were a very specific thing and the Tomb Raider reboots are their own distinct specific thing. The movie is based on the reboots and yet the movie is just another Tomb Raider. They have not to the reboot. You know, she has the pick that she uses as a weapon. Yeah, she gets all her iconic weapons. She gets the bow and arrow at one point. They have one sequence where they do what they do in the reboots, which is basically Lara getting the shit kicked out of her by rocks and water. Basically just the environment just deciding to boot Lara's head in. They only really do one thing based off that. The movie quickly turns into we're just going through a tomb, which is not what the reboots are. The reboots are, you know, basically woman Rambo. They had a chance to do Lara Rambo as a movie. That I would have watched. But for me, the most interesting aspect of this movie was when she was still in London. The movie was at its best when she was just living her normal life. And living a normal life. She was not, you know, this aristocratic figure in the manner with all of the wealth and trappings and the, you know, the gang of technologically inclined people who monitored her and all that shit. It was very grounded and yeah, I agree. But then when I wanted more of that. Yeah. Yeah, like the people she was hanging out with, the stuff, like the bicycle race, that was interesting. And it sets it all up to be like important and significant and then is just tossed aside the minute she needs to sit down. Right. You think, oh well, something's going to come up in the movie to where her skills on this bicycle will, you know, be relevant. Never does. Never does. Not merely that. But like they reinforce characters by having them appear multiple times leading you to think that they have significance and they get it. Yeah. And it just seems they stripped away a lot of, they follows the same story beats as the first Tomb Raider reboot, while I'm from 2013. They go to the same island. Well, but it didn't incorporate. It incorporates elements from the second reboot game also because the, that's where it introduces the secret society elements. Trinity has a presence. Yeah. They found a, they found an actor to play the Trinity guy who looks exactly like Constantine from the, from Rise of the Tomb Raider. Exactly like him. They don't do anything with him. But yeah, like I remember the original, like the 2013 Tomb Raider. She was on that bug that she gets on in the film and there were a lot of people on that, but yeah. And again, this movie was that it's best when she was interacting with that, like friends and stuff like that community and that. And then they take all that out. And now she's just on a boat with her dude who has one scene where he's got a personality and then doesn't for the rest of the film. That's another issue with this is characters are given personalities and then those personalities just go away and they just become people in the plot making the plot happen. All of the interesting stuff just slowly sloths off until it's just tomb, just walking through a tomb. This is where it's all funneling too. Is just another tomb raider. Yeah. Which is totally against the spirit of what they rebooted it for. They might as well have just brought Angelina Jolie back. And at the, at about the midpoint, when we do get that sort of she gets the crap beat out of her thing, which was the whole tone as I understood it of the games. And I didn't play a lot of the games. Oh, to the point where you could imagine it was someone's fetish. Yeah, that was what all the coverage at the time seemed to be conveying to me. And, and, you know, okay, that's a choice that you can make. Fine, whatever. I mean, emphasize the whole survivalist hanging on by the skin of one's teeth on an island. Yeah, there's there's merit to doing that. And, and so I'm not like critical of that aspect of it. But I, you know, I played like a couple of hours of it as I tend to do with these more open, world-y type experiences. I get two, three hours in, I set it down, I go do something else and I never come back to it. You know, I just did this most recently with God of War. I played a few hours, I set it down, I came back like a month and a half later, did another two hours. I will probably never play it again now. I just can't commit to them. So a lot of the context for, you know, comparative is lost. But the sense I got was that the game really wanted this to feel like a struggle that the character was developing through. Yeah. This is like a switch. She has one incident that is a like a moral turning point for the character. Yeah, it's there. Even like, even though they had a great basis for a movie, they added the things that would have been great for the movie as nothing more than a gesture. Her going through that sequence just felt like they were doing a video game reference when that should have been the point of the movie. I'm like, no, no, no, this isn't the kind of thing you just do as a nod to the game. This would have made a great film regardless of whether it was licensed or not. I don't know why they didn't go for it. Outside of creative bankruptcy, they had to have been either lazy or not very good to have just gone with generic action film when they could have had Rambo. Yeah, and it's, it's really I realize some people are going to say Rambo is a generic action film. The first one was fucking great. No, Rambo defined generic action films for a generation. That's, there's a difference. Yeah. But, you know, that whole survivalist thing is a movie and those moments, oh, sorry, those were that one moment was interesting. And then it just switched to so generic, just so it like this feels like it could have been made in the 90s. And it felt like they were really going that direction with the way that she seen a shot and edited and the music that they chose the perform it feels like this is supposed to be important. And then it's just not just like the characters at the beginning of the film that you're led to think are of some significance or going to like become part of her crew at some point and are forgotten. I mean, I don't know what she'd do with a short order cook or expediter from a restaurant, but had some interesting dialogue. I'd have taken that. Yeah. And I've taken that instead of it's like the movie just gets significantly less bothered as it goes on. It just cares less and less. And I they changed the whole Himmico plot line. Um, to try and I made it generic. Yeah, well, they took the, because in the Tomb Raider games, there is legit supernatural shit happening. There is some legit supernatural shit. Yeah. And they had to make it more grounded. I guess it's why fucking why that doesn't bother me so much. I don't mind that it's grounded. I'm okay. Which is pointless. I wouldn't have if it was grounded in a way that made it interesting, maybe. I mean, I'm like, I am okay with the idea of having supernatural myths and legends be revealed to have a rational explanations. Sure. If it's done well. Yeah. Yeah. It was the fact that I ask why because what did it gain them creatively? Nothing. This movie felt like it exists because a studio decided it had to happen. It feels like an obligation to smooth you know. Okay. So here's here's what it does. I can I can I can state a case for what this decision does narratively that may be what they were going for. The fact that Himmico's thing is what it is. It brings together the two points of view of Richard and Lara. Richard's being that you know, this thing exists. I believe this thing exists and I'm going to find it. And no, there's no way that this thing can exist. You're fucking crazy, Dad. And this is a way to bring together those two perspectives so that no one's wrong. Like both characters can both characters can have been effectively right throughout the entire course of the film and then it puts the parent and child on equal footing. So it's a past the torch kind of thing. But it still sucks. Yeah. I mean, that's the thing. If I could have I can rationalize it all day long, but it still sucks. Yeah. If I'd have built that thing better, you know, sure. It's just the payoff wasn't worth it because it sucks. It's like I'm a pay off. It's not being worth it. All right. Yes. Yes. And talking of obligations, just happening because you know, someone decided it had to. Right. You want to describe Tomb Raider? Yeah, let's do it. We begin with voice over from Richard Croft, data 2009, explaining the legend of Himiko, the first queen of Japan, I guess she says. She's a sorceress who ruled her empire with dark magic, spreading death with the touch of her hand. And eventually her own generals rose against her and entombed her on a remote island. Richard says he knows where she is and that he has to get there first. It doesn't really like explain anything about like for who who has to come in second, but fine. Noting that he'll be leaving his Laura behind as we're shown a photo of Jimmy McNulty and a terrified girl holding a puzzle box. I'd be terrified too. It's a fucking lament config right? Right. Yeah. Exactly. So like this is the setup for a whole other better movie. Yes. And you know what? It just occurred to me one day we could do that hell razor, that one hell razor that's said or not. Oh God. I'd like Gabe. The one that yelled maybe I'll shut the fuck up movie when we were watching it. That's the one. Cut to a boxy rig where mixed martial arts is happening. Laura Croft is doing the MMA, but doesn't do a particularly good job and goes down in a submission hold. She is fighting an actual MMA fighter in this sequence. And the guy coaching her is someone with you know like nearly a decade of UFC competitive professional whatever you call that sport. So cool they get legit people for it neat. In the locker room after she looks legit as well. She did the shit's out of you. Oh fuck yeah. I wouldn't want to meet that that person in any alley. Light well lit dark does not matter. I would be looking to go out the other direction. Hell I'd rather dog so I wouldn't see the fucking punch coming. In the locker room after she takes some ripping from a friend that we'll never see again after this scene. Yeah it does feel like this was a completely different film. She well they're establishing this community that she is going to abandon in favor of her father who abandoned her in favor of his quest. Oh okay I get it now. I get it now. This is a nature nurture thing. Yeah she's just I like how the movie abandoned a good premise. Her coach comes by looking for his apple which Laura has stolen and that figures because it turns out Laura's behind on her payments to the gym and her gig as a bike career. I guess she's probably doing it on one of these apps you know delivering food for people but it's it's not getting the job done. Speaking of bike currying currying currying currying currying curried bikers. Biking happens. I can't eat curry anymore. I used to love Indian food but that stuff is almost fatal to me end up in the hospital last time. Oh my god is it just like a allergic reaction or yeah to stuff that's used in the you know the cooking process. Put noctami into the hospital mate. Now is that is that all curries or could we come up with a curry rest? I can't take the rest of it. Oh I'm yeah yeah yeah fine I'm exactly what's going in. Okay homemade curry I could do. Okay. But I couldn't order one I couldn't go to an Indian restaurant or anything. Hey you just got to go get yourself some goat. Yeah. I could probably sell you a goat actually. I got that's good. If you sold if you sold me a goat I just keep the goat. Oh that's fine too. Goats are lovely. That is good yeah yeah. I love a pet goat. Lawn maintenance is covered. Sir yeah legit that's and and it's fed you're done problem solved. Okay so anyway Laura picks up a food order from a family restaurant where a young man is encouraged by his family to ask her out he does not and I mean we are going to see him again for a second. She then arrives at the dispatch for the curriers where two other bikers are plotting a box hunt which they explain is a racid which one rider is chased by a bunch of other riders who have to catch the lone rider before a paint can attach to their bike thereby producing a follow followable trail has emptied completely. Yeah one of the characters in this scene is played by the guy who was the mugger in an episode of Peep Show. The one who's all give us your phone give us your wallet for anyone who you know anyone listen as who enjoys Peep Show very fine very fine show and that's one I keep getting recommended on. Oh you would love it yeah you would fucking love it. All right I'll get I'll get in there I'll get in there because the promos didn't do it for me I saw a few promos and I was like yeah okay yeah it comes into its own more and more as she gets from other characters and become utterly exasperated by them yeah because it's all of like a quiet place but on purpose it seemed like sort of stock standard roommate drama when I did it's it I mean there's some of that but it's not done in a standard way mostly because of the the way the characters behave. All right all right I will I will give it a shot then I need something else to watch now I'm running out of things. So upon hearing that the winner is going to get 600 pounds Laura signs up while demonstrating her knowledge of Shakespeare and the dispatcher Bruce whom we're never going to see again. Has it exchanged with her asking why someone who knows Hamlet is a bike career they are setting him up to be another like possible love interest character to you know or to be the tech guy or you know whatever the yeah there's although someone asking why someone who knows about Hamlet is a bike career clearly doesn't actually live in London they got that bit wrong because if you live in London and you know anything about the job situation as an adult you know you could know fucking advanced physics and still end up with a job as a fucking bike career that's that was kind of what I thought actually I thought that was a little strange because how I say London pretty much fucking anywhere these days yeah yeah I was I was gonna say like I'm not above for a while there I was thinking about doing post-mates yeah well they should have said although they didn't know this is while Lara with all of her money has taken a job away from someone who might fucking need there right oh my fucking god yeah basically she's the take and take and take she's the subject of the the song common people by pump I love that song it's a fucking great song but that's exactly what it's about she's just slum in it she doesn't respect Jarvis cockers rhythmic struggles on behalf of the working class the racist odd Lara is given a head start once her can of paint is pierced biking happens Lara cunningly hides on the back of a now I if I got this slang right is this a Laurie yeah yeah okay no no yes no I can't remember what it looked like now I mean it's a trailer on the back of a truck and the truck is the Laurie right yeah I think it's a Laurie okay all right I just wanted to make sure I have my slang my but I can't remember anymore I can't remember anything about England anymore now that you've been indoctrinated entirely into American life yeah all I know is that Lara probably had great experience with this because she's probably hunted a few foxes when she was younger big push sod born with plums in her mouth hush so she almost gets away with this whole thing but elacid of the career spotter and the chase is on again briefly until he crashes into a bench in a park reveling in her seeming victory she gets distracted by a guy who looks like her dad from behind and almost takes a door from someone exiting their vehicle and while she's busy yelling at that guy who's car she almost hit like it's his fault she crashes over the hood of a car they did get right about London yeah yeah yeah she crashes over the it's exactly like that in New York too she winds up crashing over the hood of a police car I've never seen that happen in in one of these sorts of sequences before I guess what's different is the paint spilling all over the place I've never seen green paint I mean I have in in general right right but yeah I've never seen greed paint in this in this situation have I ever seen green paint in real life I've seen paint in real life I've seen white paint I know that because most people paint the houses white well and now have I ever seen green oh well I probably seen green paint when I used to get little games workshop things and paint them up oh sure there you have what works in real life works got a degree I used to paint up some orcs yeah yeah yeah you've seen wet greed paint before you recognize this I've seen wet green painting I wonder what colors of paint I haven't seen ah ah Phantom white I tell you what though watching it dry would have been better than watching this film there yeah got brought it back around hey hey that was how you build putt you to a punch slide sir that's right you set them up with the paint you work towards it you build on it you get that foundation you'll lead him to forget that you're talking about a the movie that bam. Oh yeah. Oh. Right, so anyway, love. So she crashes on this cop car, spilling paint all over to the horror of the bike couriers who I guess caught up with her despite us frequently being showed her rear and none of them anywhere in sight mirror seconds earlier. Like they all get to watch her crash over this, but none of them were there. Maybe they were too lazy to like write these characters out. But you would never see them again. So they're like, all right, they cheesed it the moment they saw cops and then just hid for the rest of their lives as fugitives, paint fugitives. There are a few of these instances in the movie where there's just an incongruity. A continuity incongruity that just doesn't work in the context of the film, but is there because the shot is more interesting with it present. That's, it comes up a few times and it's not enough that if you're not a dick like me who is dedicating hours of his life to specifically nitpicking this kind of shit, you probably not notice it. But that's why I'm here to provide that service. At the police station, a woman Lara describes as Anna and her forebar guardian arrives and they have an awkward chat about how Lara doesn't have to live like this because she has a massive inheritance that she needs only signed paperwork to clear her father deceased to obtain. He's been gone for seven years. Nobody's looking anymore, but Lara refuses to sign. Even after being told that all of his assets will be sold off, it occluded in Croft Manor. I do like this. Would that be all could make that choice privilege, Posh Sot? But I do like this dialogue exchange. I like the casual tone of it, again setting up this community, a different community, a separate community from the one that she's made for herself that we're seemingly supposed to care about, but she will now completely ignore her own favorite of her quest. But I like this interaction between, it's carried well. The actress who's playing Anna is good and the dialogue things, like the line, how upset would he be if you lost the house? I love that line and it slides in there so perfectly. It's a fun little scene. So some day Lara refuses all the sands. Takes her bike to this kick ass rooftop that only bike couriers and films ever get to go hang out at. And she gets to be moody and have a flashback to be a good child and her father going away on a trip, giving her a jade amulet that had previously belonged to her mother. He calls it magic, able to make the people that you're thinking of, no, you're thinking of them. It's the kind of lie you tell a child before you leave them forever. And then she's gone and she's sad. And some day later, presumably the next day, but who knows, Lara enters a glass, big glass building. It's the big, big egg-shaped glass building. Is this a notable building in London? Because it seems like a big important building. Yeah, I can't remember what it's called. Annex said it looked like a big butt plug. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I can't remember what it's called, but it's seen as part of the London skyline. Oh, and that was something that my wife, who sort of, she's into cities and city design and all of that. The first thing that she commented on when we were showing a skyline of London is how shitty London skyline is. London itself is shit. Like, that's a whole mess of really ugly buildings clumped together in one place. I don't. I do not understand the London skyline. It is hideous. So she goes into this glass building with cropped holdings labeled on the lobby wall. The receptionist, rightly, she's assuming a courier, but wrongly assuming she's here on courier business, tries to send around the back, which gives her a chance to be cheeky while the smug prick has her sign in. They do the whole, oh, what's your name? And then he hears the name and he's stunned and she smiles. And it's fun. In a conference room upstairs, Lara's given the paperwork to declare her father dead. But before she signs the lawyer gives her a puzzle box that is part of the inheritance and she gets distracted by it. Solving it as she explains this, similar puzzles were all over her house growing up. And the top pops open and reveals a hidden chamber with a photo of Lara. Then all these hooks come out. Yeah. Yeah. God, that would have been a better movie. Fuck yeah. Tomb Raider versus Hell Raider. Hell Raider. Oh, my God. Yes. Fuck yes. Oh, God. Someone option Hell Raider now. Get dimensioned pictures on the line. They will do literally anything. Literally anything. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. And have her running through the hell is depicted as the labyrinth in Hell Raider 2. Oh, yeah. I mean, the two made of people love architecture that will kick the shit out of you. Oh, God damn, that would be so good. And then Hell Raider movie with a budget? Wow. We're not saying that since the eighties. Did we see it at the eighties? No. Oh. Oh. So she gets distracted by this puzzle box, Solving it and the top pops open and reveals this hidden chamber with a photo of Lara and her father and a key and a note that reads the first letter from my final destination are quickly deduces what this means and leaves never having signed the documents. Yeah. So she didn't accomplish the thing she set out to do. Arriving at Croftman, her head's directly for the family crypt, finding the place where her father is supposed to eventually be interred, and presses on the first letter of his name to find that there's a cover concealing a keyhole. Key goes into hole and reveals a passage under the crypt with a secret room full of archaeological research and relics that belong in a museum, dammit. Fucking thieves. The upper class are nothing but fucking thieves. They are, they're cultural raiders. That the tomb raider bit is correct, because that is what. These posh swords with plums and their mouths do. Fucking silver spoon in titled wankers. At the rich. You know what they also do? They also develop like incredibly powerful battery technology, right? I mean Elon Musk would be watching this movie and be like, oh, fuck, those bastards beat me to it. Because there is a video camera that has been sitting on the desk here for seven years. And the battery still has enough charge to play the video. Everyone who's ever owned a PS Vita or indeed any Sony handheld knows that the battery goes if you leave it for seven years because you've had nothing to do with it. Every Sony device, and they all have their own batteries. Yeah, they all die. Well, the camera has a message for Laura from her father in the event of his death. He explains that following the death of Laura's mother, he traveled the world in search of proof of the super natural, hoping for evidence of a life after this one that he'd meet her in or some such bollocks. He also asks Laura to bird his research on the Himmico project. Conveniently, the box is on the desk too, which I mean, I guess I do. Like, she's gone to enough effort to get in here that there's no reason to make her hunt for the documents she wants her to destroy. Thanks, Dad. I mean, that was thoughtful. She opens it, begins poking around in his notes, listening to his recordings, basically defying the dying wish of her father. She hears some talk about the lost island of Yamatai hiring a captain named. Like, she would have. Of course. Like, she wouldn't have burned her dad's own his shit that she had. Yeah, I mean, you could have thought this would be. This guy's an idiot. He should be in a quiet place. He'd hired a captain to take him to this island and he asked to get there before Himmico's powers, whatever that means, falls into the wrong hands. Continuing her pattern of brazen disrespect for the memory and wishes of her father, Laura next goes to a pawn shop to sell the Jade Amulet we saw earlier, giving Nick Frost an exhaustive history of it and telling him it's his lucky day. And this is a great thing because Nick Frost was fucking great. Because Nick Frost always is. Yes, Nick Frost could be put into anything. It would be great. It's his flirting interaction, his playing off the flirting with the other woman he operates the shop with. That love it. It's delightful. There's some fierce negotiating that sees the price go from 10,000 to 8,000 pounds as she tries to convince him to give her more and he takes more away. Always a fun gag. And then she's so now how does it feel, Laura? That's what the upper class do all the time. That's right. Just take, take. And so she has for Hong Kong. At a port, she goes in search of the boat her father commissioned asking around a telegroup of young men offered to give direction. But it's a ruse aimed at distract a curse so that they may steal her backpack. Chasing happens. Eventually after running across and through several boats, Laura tackles the kid with her bag and forces him to return it before releasing him to his friends. But they're not going to take this lying down and that guy pulls a knife and refers to chasing happens. Apparently these random robbers think that one marks bag is worth a stabbing in broad daylight. Right. That didn't make much sense to me. Like she's proven herself more than capable and also it's broad to daylight right the bag off. Apparently it's very easy for you to steal them. Get another. Right. There's always going to be another bag that you could just grab. Yeah. There are going to be other bags. Jesus. Unreal. But anyway, so they chase her back. Eventually Laura winds up on the boat that she was trying to get to the first place. How convenient. And it's drunk capped and appears to scare off the street tuffs with a rifle. But he's not done. And it's just that Laura leave also. He speaks great English. So that's cool. And fortunately for Laura, he passes out and falls onto the lower deck of his ship into a pile of garbage. Laura takes the captain to a shower and sprays him with water to rouse him, showing him the email exchange with her father. He confirms that he is Lou Ren, but then so was his dad, who has also been missing for the last seven years. Again, what an amazing coincidence. Yeah. Yeah. Laura. And today, the character stops having any personality now. Right about now. Yeah. They set him up to be a funny drunk belligerent character. Well, then that goes. And he has something up and he's. He does the hangover disinterested thing for a bit in this scene. And that would have fit. But then that just sort of starts to smooth all the edges off. And then he's, yes, a standard. Not even a love interest, which I guess I appreciate. It almost seemed like they were starting to push it in that direction. But though that interest doesn't belong there. Right. Because he's just a guy. He's just bloke. That's all he is now. He is just a bloke. Yeah. Yeah. He is, he is Luke Kang in Mortal Kombat. Just not interesting. Oh, God. I just, sorry, Facebook, you know, a lot of data. I've just got it on the screen while we talk. I wasn't particularly looking at stuff. I was just trying to get a video linked. And then I just sort of put it to reason my dancing. And that's just made me feel upset. Sorry, carry on. Oh, she dances. No. Oh, OK. I saw her dancing, but she doesn't dance. She was doing some half art. It patronizing thing with some kids on some fucking diplomatic trip or something. Oh, God, it was just a cringe, you know, me. Well, three steps away from Lara, that one. Posh, sod, taking jobs from the poor. Lara tries to convince the reluctant Lou Ren to follow in their father's footsteps, suggesting that she has coordinates if she could figure out how to decode them from the symbols in her father's journal, which Lou Ren does immediately by observing that their clock hands, because he sees them and he sees the clock in his same view simple enough. Observing the aftermath of a poker game, Lara then tries to apply him with money that she has from selling the amulet and that manages to convince him. And he says that she'll need an experienced captain to get her there safely. So as they travel, we get more of Richard Croft's recordings, which reveal there's some sort of big door to get through on the island in a set of ordeals referred to as the chasm of souls, the faces of him, echo, and something to do with hundreds of handmaidens before you can actually get to the tomb proper. Richard also reveals the existence of a secret organization called Trinity that seeks to control the supernatural and rule the world. And he thinks they want to use this hemico as a weapon of some kind. So cool, more exposition. That night, a restless Lara goes above deck to watch the sunset, not realizing that this would indicate that they are traveling west and not northeast as one would if one were traveling by boat from Hong Kong to an island off the coast of Japan. Just, you know, she and her shit as well. Yeah, yeah, but they just look like it should float. They did it for the shot. They did it because it was more dramatic to have them sailing into the sunset. But they wouldn't be. You want things that look good in a trailer? Yeah, yeah, I also, I question. I question Lou Ren's competency as an experienced captain. We'll get back to that. Cut to flashback where teenage Lara is practicing archery, repeatedly missing an apple on a stump. Once again, Richard is leaving on a trip and Anna is going to take care of her and his absence, something that Lara resists, saying she can take care of herself by this point. It's a dream and Lara is awakened to the ship being rocked by violent waters. She joins Lou Ren on the bridge and he's pretty not chill about the whole situation. The ship hits some rocks surrounding the island and Lou Ren declares that they must abandon the ship. Lara runs back for her father's notes and then the pair attempts to reach the lifeboat. Well, the ship bounces like a pinball between rocks. Ship wrecking happens. Lou Ren is tossed from the ship by a massive wave and Lara leaps off as it breaks apart on a huge rock shortly thereafter. She swims to shore and crawling on the beach sees the shapes of people before she's knocked out with a rifle but. Lara wakes in a tent with a dude opening a can of peaches and dude tells her that she hit her head on a reef and that he saved her from drowning, which is totally not what happened. He also has her backpack. Oh, and he knows her name. And he introduces himself as Matthias Vogel and opposite food. This is Walton Goggins. Walton Goggins. What else is Walton Goggins in? I only know him from vice principals. Okay. A very funny, very dark show. Yeah, about Danny McBride. Danny McBride and Walton Goggins are two vice principals that want the principal job after the old principal leaves and conspire to ruin the life of the new principal. And it's very funny and the characters are just so, it's a Danny McBride vehicle so the characters are irredeem of bottle. And it just gets fascinating. Fucking funny, but it's also just, oh my God, these characters are really horrible. And then that becomes the sort of the conflict of it, is you don't want to root for them at all. But you are fascinated as to how far they'll go. And in between, there's plenty of Danny McBride, awkward humour. Yeah. Well, Laura is, oh, as he offers her the peaches, and as she's eating the Vogel really puts the crazy shine on, saying he's been here for years and the only person to talk to is on a sat phone, and that person says he can't leave until he's done what he's here to do. And he does all sorts of odd jobs, and he just seems like a bad guy. Just like a good guy. And Laura, a re-chooser backpack, looks for a father's journal, but can't find it because Vogel's holding it. He's pretty amused because, oh, he's the bad guy looking for the entrance to the tube. Okay, that solves it. And he knew that Richard knew it, and here it is, Richard's research dropped in his lab. So that's super convenient for him. He's in a good mood about all this. Oh, and he tells Laura, he killed her father. So that's some bummer news for her. Kind of stunned. She stumbles out of the tent to find demolition charges being exploded. This is like a weird rough transition. Like, she comes out the tent flap, and it cuts to a shot of a rock wall being exploded with explosion, you know, with... They did set it up nicely, though, because you hear the booms throughout the conversation in the tent. Yeah. So you know something's coming. I thought that was actually a well-paced little scene with the booming, and then she walks out. Pub-boom. Crack a boom. It's fine, but what they do is they do this close zoom. That is... Oh, no, it's not filmed great when it happens. Like, it seems to suggest that it's a lot closer to her position than it is at first glance, because it cuts directly from her looking out to this very close-up zoom shot of an explosion in a rock face. And then you come to find, oh no, it's like... A football field away. She's... There's all these people, all these people moving around supplies and shit in ragged clothing and dudes with guns between her and that. Yeah, and oh, and hey, there's Lou Ren. How convenient. There's a whole operation going on here. And Vogel soon comes out of the tent to tell people that, hey, this operation's packing up and moving out. And Laura has her hands bound and she's in, you know, prisoner status. So as this entire camp then moves in a line through a forest on this island, Laura and Lou Ren gets to do a little catching up. He explains that the people here are mostly ship direct sailors and human trafficking victims. Laura apologizes for having broadened here in the first place and they have this awkward exchange of, well, we're not dead yet and no shit. This line feels so dead and empty and out of place. In this, it felt like the writers were trying to do something clever and witty and this was the best they could come up with. And rather than just say, you know, we don't need a clever thing. They said, fuck it. We'll put it in. Well, it's at this point. And I think this is the moment where all the personalities have been left now. They gone. Every character with a personality, with the exception of Vogel, whose personality isn't complicated. You know, it's much what you'd expect from a bad guy villain in a situation like this. I mean, even him is, even he is like generic villain. Yeah, he doesn't even go into the full sort of mad isolated ranking and raving stuff. He's not even interesting enough for that. He's barely the Nazi that burns his hand in Raiders. Yeah. Like, barely. Like, if a little bit of work he could get there and be interesting on that level. But that guy's just interesting because he burned his hand. You got a funny look at face. Pretty much. So yeah, like everything they've established about Laura, everything they've established about Lou, and it's just, no, just gone. There's no. Lou and has no personality left. She's got nothing. They're just reacting to events. Yeah. The group arrives at the base of a mountain and begin the work of moving the supplies up it. One of the slaves has a coughing fit and stops working. So after a bit of Lou, and Laura asking their captors to maybe, you know, cut the guys some slack, Vogel nonchalantly shoots the ill man and then threatens Laura by unnecessarily cocking his semi-automatic pistol and dramatic fashion. He doesn't need to cock the gun here. He just fired around. In fact, in order for him to have cocked the gun, he would have needed to uncock it and then cock it again dramatically. Yeah, which would have been great. That would have been great. That would have worked better for me. Because then he shoots the dude, then he's all like, hold on a second. Yeah, he shoots the guy. He uncocks it, you know, lowers the gun a little bit and then just decides to turn. That's creepier than he was prepared to not shoot someone else, but now he's reconsidering it. As everyone's going back to work, Lou rend decides to take the opportunity to attack one of the guards with a shovel, allowing Laura to attempt escape. Lou rend also tries to get away, but is shot in the abdomen. And after a brief chase, Laura moves into a rapidly moving river that she falls off of a log to land in. Now here's what should have been the film, but instead is a throwaway nod, a gesture. Yeah, there's all this chase stuff that should have been the whole of the movie, the run across this log and then falling and then getting the crap beat out of her. She's tumbled down river. Vogel calls his men off saying he'll send one specific dude. I think his name is Rocket. Is that because he resembles the raccoon? I'm not sure. But he just happens to be the one who's got no personality. None. Doesn't need one. Meanwhile, Laura gets to the inevitable waterfall in this river because of course, this time it has the rotted Hulk of a Japanese bomb or plane on the edge of it. I have seen this done somewhere else before. Hell, I think I've seen it in, if not this guy, if not one of the Tomb Raiders, then something similar and uncharted at once. Yeah, because that's the thing. I don't know if this is, I mean, I didn't see it in Tomb Raider gang again. I don't know if it was done in there, but it feels like an uncharted thing to do. Or like, you know, enslaved. One of those more on rails, eclimbing traversal games. She climbs top a wing that's spanning the falls, which begins to disintegrate under her weight and then jumps to the body of the plane and climbs inside, which lets her take a little breather. She finds a sharp bit of some metal to cut the ropes that are tying her hands together. It gets to working on that when the plane shifts again, it begins falling over the edge of the falls to her chagrin and her expressed exasperation. Wining up with Laura in the cockpit upside down, basically waiting to die, but she spies a parachute just barely and reach and grabs it as the plane finally curines down the cliff, opening the rotted shoot to give her just a little bit of glide and prevent her from going squish. And she winds up back into the forest. On the ground, Laura has a chunk of metal in her tummy that she's got to pull out before wandering to the beach and realizing that, oh yeah, I've got no fucking way off this island. And that night, as she's trying to get some sleep, she's awakened by rustling leaves and snapping twigs, indicating a predator is coming in her direction. And this would have been a great opportunity for like an animal rather than just having him show up. Animals are in the game. They're not in this film. They are not. Do we even see any wildlife in this film? No, none. It's just struck me that I think we only ever see trays. Is there any animal in this film at all? At any point? Just the fox who's tail on the back of her bicycle at the beginning. Wow. I'm trying to remember, I don't think I saw a single fucking animal. Maybe some birds are best, but I don't remember any. I don't call any either. That is so strange. This fucking film is such a waste. This film is a waste of the premise and a waste of the license. They might as well not fucking bothered. Money, it exists only for money. So it's the dude from the camp that Vogel sent to her and he gets the jump on or all the same before some fighting happens. And then in what should be and quite possibly is the most powerful scene in the film, she drowns him face down in a puddle. Yeah, she uses her entire body weight on his back and head to keep him in the puddle and it's not badly done seen. No, it's a show to her using resourcefulness to deal with this bigger, stronger dude and keep him down. And this is the shit that this film again should be made out of. Yes. Yes, it should have been this, like her being resourceful and taken out these fucking guys with guns and shit. It came into terms with her own power. Like that's there's great opportunity to build a character with depth and nuance that you wanna see through multiple films. Or hell, even if you don't want the depth and nuance, a character would be nice. That said, that'd be sure. I'd settle. It's like with this dude that she drowns, he's established in an earlier scene that the camera just sort of dies past and he leans at her. And it's like, okay, they're setting him up to have the sort of horrible villainous designs on her. But they don't follow it up with writing. He just comes after her because he sent after her, displays no personality whatsoever and he's drowned. Give me a scene. They didn't bother writing what they were trying to set up. Give me a scene that's a little more from his perspective that's him doing the hunt, you know, where we can almost see through the eyes of the predator, type deal. You know, give us a little bit of that. Extend this hunt out over a broader length of the film so that there's a payoff. No, it's just over. And the payoff is supposed to be that this is a turning point for the character that she's killed a man. And it is, I guess, but like everything else in this, the power of that is just gone because it's deflated and ignored. And now she's just a badass. No, one thing, they did get that right from the game. There's one scene where she's a bit regretful about killing a dude and then it's, just firing arrows into people's eyeballs and loving it. So they did get that right because the very next scene is like her shooting arrows at dudes are not giving a fuck. So pretty soon thereafter. Yeah. Oh, yeah, not the next scene, but very soon. Yeah, it's pretty, it's not going to take long. After grappling, having killed a man, she spots someone observing her and presumably wanting there to be no witnesses, follows them to the beach where they climb a rope up a sheer rock face, raising it after the undeterred Lara Croft climbs the cliffs of insanity to discover her bearded father in a cave. And this was all very undisturbed as well. It is. Oh, right, there's a dad alive. And I really hoped for a sort of Inigo Montoya man in black scene, throw me the rope. I'm not throwing you the rope. But no, just your hallucination. That could have been a lot more fun. Instead, he just thinks he's nuts and is seeing things because he's had hallucinations over in the past. And then after reminding him of the specific way in which they would blow kisses to each other that we've seen in a couple of flashbacks now, Richard accepts that she's actually there. And Lara collapses from her preexisting wounds. Yes, yes, her preexisting wounds. Yes, that piece of metal. Yes, that rolling around in that fetted fucking forest water, drowning the man in the puddle. Hershits so infected. Like so infected. She's going to need an antibiotic. He apparently still has a first-aid kid, though. All these years later, it suits her up to her displacement. Well, there's fucking rich as he is. He probably bought 50 that could have gone to the pool. Well, by the way, I don't have a working glass chip on my shoulder because I am fat and I have eaten it. Well, ahead of him arriving on the island by boat, he had a plane fly over and drop packages all over to prepare for his arrival. He's so fucking rich. Why didn't he fly there? Yeah. These guys flew here. Well, what a fucking idiot. What a tit. Back at Vogel's cat, the slave crew has uncovered the door to him. It goes to him. And Vogel calls back to base in order to transport. Meet. Lara wakes up, finds her father gone again. But he's just on the beach cleaning up his beard. Interesting how now the exit of the cave exits directly out to the beach as opposed to requiring that whole cliff climbing thing. But fuck do I know. He's getting respectable. She tries to help him trim his beard while he asks how she fared in his absence. And maybe when she's holding scissors isn't the best time for such a conversation. Yeah, my name. With your daughter that you abandoned. Yeah. Then he gets that it was wholesale the world line how Vogel will never find the tomb because Richard is quote unquote dead. And Lara burned the research. Except Lara didn't burn the research, which he should really have figured out because she's here. Yeah, very presumptuous and a little bit misguided. He has no room to be pissed off that she didn't do it at this point because he's such a fucking idiot for not realizing that there's no way she could have done it. Yeah, and not burning it himself before he left. That's something we need to know. Like he was so good. He was so aware that this knowledge was bad that he filmed himself with it before he left. And that taking the knowledge to the island itself was a risk because he's aware of these people who are racing for him. And if he took the knowledge to the island there and something went wrong, now the knowledge that he's gained and how to get through all this shit is there as well, making it easier for the person who's coming. So yes, it's... He wanted this stuff burned. His goal was to destroy all the shit. So... It's like he wanted the knowledge to die with him, right? The best way to do that is to burn it all. So it's just in your fucking head, along with hallucinations about your fucking daughter, your rich daughter. Which I mean, you know, he kept forgetting the importance she had in favor of his stupid quest. So maybe he was worried he would be able to remember the details. Apparently that didn't teach basic consequences in fucking Poshau University. Do they John Crofty Poshau, Wanker? Oh, there's on a counselor state, mate. There was no Oxford or Cambridge for me. But Richard is pissed all the same that he underestimated her bravery. Ooh, she doesn't feel like the right word here. Yeah, well she was like, oh, you think I thought I was stupid? And he's like, no, I think you're brave. Sometimes they're, you know, two sides on the same coin, isn't it? Yeah, I would have gone with stubborn or obstinate or determined. Any of those would better describe what she did. Yeah, yeah. It wasn't brave to not burn some paper. Right, the bravery is going to have to come later. But that's not the inspiration. Laura attempts to persuade him to strike back at Vogel and when he resists, she takes his bow and arrow and goes to do it himself. Running back to the camp, she first does some stealthy infiltration around Vogel's tent because I guess it was in the game, right? A little bit stealth. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that was sneaking about. She's there just a time to hear him come back and bitch about not having a combination to the door and ordering that they try explosives again, indicating that they've, this is a thick fucking door. Then if they've already attempted to use explosives to open it once and we've brought this up before I know, but I always admire the technological prowess of ancient civilizations and their ability to construct very elaborate traps and doors. It makes you wonder why, you know, their civilizations aren't around now and in charge of fucking everything. Well, because they all died due to their own traps. Yes. They built, they built, they built, someone gets locked in the house and they can't get out. Like I can't find my keys. I'm gonna stop to death in my impenetrable tank house. Black mirror. Black beard. Laura then finds Lou Ren with a bunch of slaves killing the guards over seeing them. I guess they're on a lunch break or something. Lou Ren takes his gun from this dead guy and escaping happens. And over the course of this whole escape sequence, Lou Ren is the only person in this whole movie to make use of the grenade launcher that's on everybody's gun. I just felt like pointing that out. I don't know why. I think they just needed to throw an explosion in. No need to something people were following us late at this point. Oh, it's, it's quite, quite probable. Near the tube entrance, Laura spots her father nosing around the big door and then Vogel shows up and captures him demanding that Richard open it. Richard refuses and when it looks like he's gonna be shot, Laura takes out the guard. So leading to a standoff, appealing to a suspicion that her father's completely lost his mind, Vogel convinces Laura to open it instead. And so she turns the various cylindrical things on the door like one of her puzzles and we're reminded that she's good at puzzles because we showed flashbacks over two week puzzles. Cause she had the Lamassian box. She quickly opens it, revealing a deep cave. And they descend into the cave with a handful of guards. This is now Laura Vogel, Richard guards. It's at this point I said to Alex, if I wasn't watching this movie for work, I'd have turned it off by now. Yep. This is the resident evil team penetration sequence. This is the, you know, every fucking tomb entry sequence. I mean, they always go into these fucking things with the good guys, the bad guys having to go in at the same time and work together to some extent to make it through, even though they're working at odds. And yeah. And let's face that, after the Brendan Frazier mummy film perfected all of this, all tomb sequences, there was never a need for another one because the mummy is the world's most perfect film. It's got a man covered in locusts saying, what have we done? Don't get better than that. Don't get better than that. You and my wife like that movie. I do have those movies. Fucking great. Brendan Frazier's finest hour. Benny was right. I don't know if you, I don't know if you noticed this right, but Benny was on the wrong side of the river. How is that not the greatest? What a great film. What a great film the mummy is. I haven't seen the new one I don't want to. Yeah, no, I didn't. Oh, I liked, I could do without the dark cinematic universe. You desperate fucks. Oh, you see, I, okay, I didn't need it to be like a dark edgelord cringy shit, but the idea of reviving all of the classic movie monsters in a cinematic universe, that does it with good intentions, but it wasn't. It was rushed out because like everyone's seen Marvel's success and they think they're entitled to it. Right. And that's things like this is not the first time it was done. Is the other bit like the actual kind of model for all of this is Abynon Castello beat the Wolfman and all of these like, you know, a ton of that shit back in the day. There was lots of crossovers and shit and you know, if they'd have done this properly and not done it way, if they hadn't done it so dark and edgelordy, they could have let all this up to a remake of the monster squad and we would live in the world's best movies. The template was there. All they had to do was fucking follow it. It's not like it couldn't because Infinity War was, you know, on the press person and ready to come out and everything was leading there and they're like, we gotta get there as quickly as possible. So that's lose our shit. They get at the same time. Like they're not C-DC and being like, but not that. Because that's what they did. Yeah. Well, because they don't, they only look at the successful thing and think we need to be there yesterday. We can't, we don't have time to do what Marvel did and actually will be built towards it in a way that won't look cynical and pathetic, but no, desperate pathetic filth. Ah, well, anyway, back to this. So as you might expect, there are traps that are set off by plates in the floor in this tomb. Very original. The first one causes some spikes to shoot up from the floor and impale through the crotch, one of the armed people accompanying them. Richard makes the point that, hey, this looks like it was there not to keep people out, but to keep them in. Well, thank you for that insight, Richard. We really appreciate it. They find the chasm of souls, which is a white pit, filled with a massive pile of bones, and a ladder is used as a bridge. Lara's made to cross first, followed by the rest of the gang, then they arrive in a chamber that has walls lined with prayer wheels and become trapped when the doors on either side close and the floor begins dropping out from underneath them. Can we design some new traps? I feel like everything I'm seeing, I've seen a thousand times in other, no, descend into the tomb sequences. Could these ancient civilizations have just been maybe a little more original? Were they all operating off of blueprints that they shared? Yeah. I don't think so. Some original traps would have been nice, but we don't get that. No, we don't. What we do get instead is, well, okay. Now, in fairness, it wouldn't be Tomb Raider without a light puzzle. Yeah. So here it is. It's a height light puzzle. I hate them. They're so tired and they're so done. Mm-hmm. She sees a shaft of light coming through the far door and they locate colored bits of glass and the prayer wheels lining the walls of the roof and Lara figures out that it's a color puzzle. And after working about on the clues from Richard's research, does a yellow and blue mix green thing, which is the first thing you try anytime, like always. Green means go. Fucking video games. The group then proceeds to find the tomb itself. Meanwhile, Lou Ren goes looking for Lara and has the support of this entire band of former slaves somehow because his dad had also died there previously and they liked him. I've literally gotten, I like a can't, fine. Yeah. I'm fine. I'm not gonna argue it. In the tube, they pass through a crypt containing the corpses of Hemicose Handmaidens and Lara acknowledges that all of this fits right in with Richard's research. And finally, they come upon a stone coffin. The ogle orders it open to reveal Hemicose super well-preserved corpse that immediately begins rapid rotting upon exposure to the air. Vogel orders his men to prepare the body for transport and looking around. Lara realizes that the paintings on the wall do not depict a monster being forced here, but Hemicose coming to this place voluntarily and realizes that she was sacrificing herself to protect the world. As the guards try to remove Hemicose from the coffin, the corpse does a fun jump scare thing, rigged to a mechanism and Vogel... That was so stupid. I go through all of these death traps and the last thing they've got is basically what you see in a ghost train at the fair. Yep. Yep, pretty much. I'm sure that she appreciated that in death. Right, what are you gonna do? You're gonna rig me up to a fucking ghost train thing to make my corpse pop out, like try and add a scream. And maybe those weird whistles that you get in the ghost train. Wooo! That's what I want. They didn't get that bit in, unfortunately. I love that. Yeah, you know, I suspect that the handmaidens, or all the dead skeletons that are all over this fucking place, I suspect that most of them were people who died trying to carve holes in the sides of the mountain that would produce the specific whaling noises and they just couldn't get it done, you know? Yeah. Uh... Man, they should have put a werewolf head, like, mask on a skull as well. I've really spooked them. Have a couple Dracula's hanging around. But then shit goes bad. One of the guards starts developing a really bad rash and Laura realizes that he could go with the carrier of some kind of disease transmitted by touch. And the infected guard loses his shit and becomes aggressive, so Vogel shoots him. Now, here's the thing about this whole, like that whole carnival fair pop-up thing that should make this more horrifying. But they couldn't do. I would not be surprised if this was put into the script at some point and then pulled out. But that fucking rotted, desiccated powdery corpse if this is transmitted by touch, meaning that there's something on the surface of her skin that is transmitting this viral agent. If her skin turns to dust and then she suddenly sits up and displaces all of this skin dust into the air. I was just thinking that it's catapulting the disease at ya. Right. So in fairness to the people designing the tube, pretty good idea. Man. As for the writers, fuck you. The infected guard gets shot, Vogel realizing that there's an easier way to deal with all of this than carrying the body back, opts to prune a finger from Himiko and tucks it into a plastic baggy. While he's doing this, Laura spots a pickaxe, a very iconic looking pickaxe. And it surprises one of the two remaining guards with it. Laura's forced to flee the chamber, chased by the guy she stabbed, while Richard and Vogel have each other pinned down in the tomb with guns. Eventually the other guard that was in the room who was also lifting the corpse, he appears all death zombieed out in the tax-richered wounding him, Vogel makes his escape. Laura then climbs across the corpse of the handmaid, hiding from the guy chasing her, gets found, and then chased through another trapped corridor with some spinning cylinders of spikes that eventually take out the guard. I don't know why this side chamber even exists, because it clearly wasn't on the path they walked down before. Laura returns to the chamber with the coffin, where Richard reveals that he's been infected, and after a heart-wrenching farewell, Richard sends her to deal with Vogel, while he destroys the tube with the rest of him. It goes corpse in it by using it left behind explosives. Laura then catches up with Vogel at the castle of souls, while he's walking across the ladder, and she jumps ahead of him and confronts him. It's a fighting happens, and she brings Vogel back to the near side of the castle before kicking the ladder down and trapping them both inside the tomb. More fighting happens, as Vogel attempts to kill Laura with her own iconic weapon. For this can happen, however, Richard detonates the explosives in the tomb, distracting Vogel lugged up for Laura to get the upper hand, and shoved the desiccated finger of him to go into Vogel's mouth. And then for good measure, she kicks him into the chasm, and he falls doing a combination of the, I should have seen Paris fall with the, I opened the arc of the covenant rod. Yep. And... To the cologne. Yeah. And with the tube collapsing around her, Laura bedgets to barely leap across the chasm, using the pickaxe to climb up from the ledge. She then runs the rest of the way out, but it's unclear she escaped until 20 seconds later, when Lou ren happens to be there to see the rope that she was climbing up, move, and reunite. So I'm so worried. I'm so worried, I'm so concerned. I've gotten out. Yeah. Reunited, they repeat the not dead yet, not dead yet, no shit line from before, which explains why it had to be there. That was the big twist of the film, as we found out why they had that exchange earlier. Oh, I get it now. It was so that they could say it again. The transport Vogel ordered arrives at the slaves with Laura at Lou red, and the hijack it to escape the island. Back in London, Laura signs the paperwork to Claire Gritchard deceased. She agrees to have Anna continue to oversee the day-to-day operations of the company, and the lawyer provides her with a thick book of assets that the company owns. As she's flipping through, she pauses and confers with the lawyer that these are all now her assets, and then goes home, and back to the corrupt, because she made a connection, and has realized that, oh my God, her family has owned the company that is financing the paramilitary organization that's tried to steal all the supernatural shit and rule the world. And has been behind at the whole time. It is a big twist. And if you played Rise of the Tomb Raider, you are waiting for this penny to drop the whole film. Right. Yeah. Because this is like a pretty significant portion of that story. It's a twist in Rise of the Tomb Raider, like, at the midpoint. Yeah. Yeah. And so this sets her up to now go through the Trinity research that her father did and start stopping these bad people. And... Rich probably wouldn't notice this if he hadn't been gallivanting all around the world looking for the afterlife. I'm just saying. Yeah. If he hadn't been... If he wasn't busy abanting his daughter. If he had been the kind of craft that Lara thought he was the kind of craft and that she was not in stead turning out to be exactly the kind of craft her father was with no actual interest in the business. If he'd been that kind of craft, none of this shit would have happened. He's maybe should have been cold that because that's what it was. It was a kind of craft. We get the film title at this point. Now a full hour and 46 minutes into the first season. So there's your exposition. Lara returns to the pawn shop to retrieve her amulet to Nick Frost's disappointment as they chat. She notices that they've got a whole fucking bunch of guns that display at the back of the shop that they did close up. Wow. It's just out there looking really cool for us to say. And for an American audience, they might not realize what a big fucking deal that is. Yeah. Because they do not have guns in London. Or at least like that. Not a giant display of them in a pawn shop. No. Maybe things have changed since I lived there. I mean, I'm sure that if you wanted to find a gun in London there are avenues through which you could find guns. My next door neighbor had an entire armed response unit turn up once because they heard he had a gun in the house. A gun. It was fucking freaky seeing that many cops with guns out there. Never see that in England. Yeah. That's just it. You know, as Americans, we see all these guns. I think it just be like, oh, okay. It's a pawn shop. Sure. They're full of guns. So what are they going to have? Not guns. So Laura picks out a couple of ancient caves to finish her costume. Because you're like, oh, she's going to get it too. Oh, yeah. Oh, fuck. I'll take two. Is the. Because of the two. Because the guy. Oh, you're the two. Because she's the wrong la recruffed. Because that's not what she fucking has in the reboot. No, they literally brought her all the way back around to a rich little la recruffed. Because they might as well have just carried on from the Angelina Jolie ones. Because that's all they wanted to do. That's clearly all they wanted to do. Also, given that where the title comes up in this, I like to think that everything we saw was an introduction and the real-hole movie was just her and that pawn shop getting the guns. Credits roll. End of movie. I don't love to if that's all this film was. That action, well, that makes sense. This is the film about how she became the Tomb Raider by buying those two guns in that bunch. How she became the Tomb Raider from the old games. Did you like it or not? It's, like I said, it's competent. The action sequences are fine. The special effects in the boat sequence are fine. They're not like amazing, but they add the presence of minds to, you know, have it happen at night. As opposed to the experienced fucking captain who knows the dangers of these waters and approaches said island at fucking night. I forgot how pissed off I was about that. That's incredibly stupid. No, it's not a great movie. And it's not even a great Tomb Raider movie, I don't think. It fails to capitalize on the opportunities presented by the reboot. Just- Yeah, I mean, it basically ignores the reboot except to make gestures towards it. I think it just absolutely wanted to be another. Because the old Tomb Raider games were good for basic schlock action movie fair. And that's all they really wanted to do. And the movies I think still hold up as basic schlock action movie fair. They're not better than this one does as well. Because this one feels almost like it's reaching for something more. But then decides not to. Yeah. It's like they realize they've got to base off the new ones to stay relevant, but they didn't want to do that. So we get this thing that is nothing. That would have been challenging. That would have required something more than just meeting perfunctory plot-plot beats and putting people into the tomb. Yeah. And that's all it was. It was just so by the numbers. Bog standard film. Now. And you do not need to waste your time ever seeing this. That said, there is a part of me that wants to believe that this has all of the makings of good exposition for a much better scene. I can see opportunities for them to go back to those fucking characters that we were interested in that they forgot about and make them a more integral part of Laura's life. Yeah. There's there are there's enough set up in this that there's the faintest glimmer of hope for something salvageable to come out of it down the road. But as it sits right here, it's just meh. A lot of a lot of potentially good ideas set up and then quickly abandoned in favor of a wrote generic thing that we've seen a million times before. Yeah. So what are we doing next time, Jim? I guess we said it at the top, but remind me. Yeah, was it chasing ghosts? Chasing ghosts. Yes, that's correct. This is, oh, I'm very, very excited. I'm looking forward to this. Yeah. I've been ever since you spoke up in the King of Kong episode. This is for those who can't remember Roryf, you will be new because I guess I could still crack on that no one listens to an episode of these twice. Yeah, this is the documentary that follows up on some of the characters from King of Kong and I believe have some new people to enjoy. Yeah, they were shot roughly at the same time. Or within, and I think I think King of Kong might have been shot first shot later, but came first. But this, that they're roughly contemporary within a year, they were released within the same year. And they go deeper into the personalities. It's less about the events and fascinating. There's some good old friends. There's some good, some people that we were just shown glimpses of in King of Kong that really get there do here. It's fascinating. Looking forward to doing that in a couple of weeks. Awesome. So a lot of you next time. Thank you for listening. Thank you for sharing stuff and being involved. Always appreciate it. What are they circulating the tapes? Yes. It helps us because YouTube's algorithms won't. And we will see you next time. Bye. Bye. Fucking quiet place.",

      "text": "Hello there and thank you for deciding to listen to another episode of I Like Films, my podcast. I know of course there are a lot of podcasts available and they're all free so it makes it hard to choose which ones to settle on but you've chosen ours so thank you for that. Today I'll be talking to the brilliant English Nigerian actor, Truitelle Egeofa. The first came to my attention in the movie Dirty Pretty Things way back in 2001 before that. He popped up in a number of films and small roles. He was in Amistad of course before that but went on to make movies like Love Actually. So Renate, which I dood Kinke Boots, was a big film for him. He was terrific in children of men. 12 years of slave was a very important movie for him as an actor and his career but also just generally it's a very important movie. More recently he's popped up in a couple of more mainstream things including Dr Strange of course and he'll soon be appearing or not appearing as the case may be as the voice of scar in the big movie. But today we'll be talking about his directorial debut, a film which he has just finished and he's promoting at the moment. It's available on Netflix and we'll also be showing some sort of selected release at Cinemas. I think the Curse and Chain are showing it up and down the UK so if you get the chance to see it there please do. I think it would really benefit from that big screen experience but it's a charming and true story. A lovely film, quite intimate, quite emotional and as I said memorable and powerful called The Boy Who Harnessed The Wind. He appears in it as an actor of course but it's his work as the director of this film that I wanted to start the conversation with. So Churto, congratulations on the movie first of all. I'm thrilled to say I loved it obviously I would have still wanted to do this interview over hadn't but I would have politely skirtied around it. But why direct because obviously you acting career is so well established now and this is a big commitment. I think the reason was because of the book The Boy Who Harnessed The Wind is the book by William Camp Cwamba that he wrote with Brian Mealer. I read it about ten years ago when it came out I was in Los Angeles and the friend of mine was at the book party, the book launch for the book. I was sent the book and I just fell in love with it. I fell in love with the story. I thought it was so poignant, so relevant. I thought it worked on so many different levels. I thought it was hopeful, I thought it was optimistic but I thought it was real and I thought it represented the truthful cultural life as well as an economic life as well as a geopolitical life. I also represented these other important issues climate change in equality, people face and growing inequalities of that. This extraordinary central conversation about education, science and the future and optimism. Visali, I don't know if anyone else has said this, a bicycle figures quite heavily in the story. There were moments before that that it reminded me of that great piece of neo-realist cinema, The Bicycle Thief, to see Cicadas film. Which once gets a story of common people whose lives are changed fundamentally by something that you or I would take absolutely for granted. That kind of like the extreme poverty that people find themselves and the trap that represents. Yeah, absolutely. Bicycle Thief is one of my favourite films ever and I think that what Diceka captured is that exact period in Italy, the post-war period, extreme poverty, extraordinary circumstances of people to be in but trying to find and maintain a level of dignity and understanding and connection. And being forced to make all of these extraordinary choices. And one of the central elements of the film, of Diceka's film is obviously these family dynamic and a father and a son trying to negotiate how to deal with their relationship in the context of everything that's going on. There was certainly a large part of Diceka and some of the other films of that period, you know, that really influenced what I was trying to say in terms of this family dynamic being the sort of sharpest central point of the story and this father and son being the central point of the story and having a conversation about all of these other issues that grow around that, around family. There's some beautiful performances in it around you alongside with yours. The young boy is particularly good but I thought the woman who plays your wife, his mother, there's just a beautiful moment in the film which she is responsible for creating with you of course. These were local actors or people who you knew off beforehand? So, Aissa Megas, her name, she's a French actress, she is just brilliant and I had been familiar with her and familiar with her work and was excited to meet her because I thought she captured so many different qualities. She had this extraordinary strength and tenacity but she could be very tender and maternal as well and the character of Agnes in the screenplay becomes a sort of growing relevance, you know, sort of grows on us in time. And becomes such a central and important part of this family's dynamic and journey. So, I was really looking for somebody who could capture both of those things really, could have that tenderness and that very kind of maternal quality and but then could have this tenacity, this strength, this focus and really becomes very much a turning point in the whole story and a strong driving force for the other characters. Maxwell Simba, who plays William Campuamba, is a brilliant young actor from Nairobi and he was somebody that took a long time to find, you know, we had a great casting director in Alexa Fogel who had contacts not only in Malawi but in Kenya and also in South Africa as well as Europe and the States and started going to schools and to really kind of talk to people and audition people and just sort of a cast a lot as wider net as she could. And soon enough, you know, people sort of got narrowed down and there was Maxwell in the middle of all this. And you touched with him because presumably the chemistry between you and he, the father and son, that was pretty important. Totally. I mean, I saw the first tape of Maxwell's, you know, here what I was here, he was in Nairobi and I saw it on the computer and I couldn't quite believe it in a way. I just sort of understand it, you know, that somebody so young could be so nuanced and who hadn't had no experience in film before, had done a couple of plays at school, could be so subtle and detailed and make all these choices, you know, choices that it took me a long time to work out how to make choices like that, you know. And yet there he was and so I sort of felt like I had to sit with my own eyes type thing before I could make any decisions about it. So I flew to Nairobi and did sort of workshops with him and exactly that, you know, just finding out how he worked with me. I was doing some improvisations and sort of trying to throw him a little bit and all of these things that I was sort of trying to pull out and he was just completely unfazed. And you improvised in English or what is the dialect that's spoken in the film? So we speak in Tachua which is the language of Malawi and he doesn't speak, so he had to learn it as well as me. Yeah, I shouldn't know it either. I didn't know any Tachua. So we both had to learn it, I said had to learn Tachua as well. Lily Bander who plays Annie who is one of her central characters and Philbert who plays Gilbert, another of the central characters is the only two of the central group that spoke Tachua anyway, both from Malawi. So for the rest of us we were just late night working sessions of our channel. And can you still break it out if need be? Well, I mean only the specific. But you like the chunks you needed. I mean, Phil that was the emotion that you were working on. Yeah, I started off learning the language broadly when I first was having it translated in the UK by Sencem Kambula who was working on the translation who's an artist and a writer. And then as we turn that corner towards production it just became about learning what I was going to say. And imagine it was important to you to use that language in the film to do that because conceivably you could have shot this with everyone speaking English. Yeah, I mean it's possible to do that. You know, I felt like there were a couple of things that would have we would have lost. I think that authenticity of the story would have sort of disappeared I think. And we would have always been aware that we were kind of you know that that sort of fourth wall we would just have been aware of something being changed because we would know I think instinctually you know that people in the villages in those context probably don't speak English at home. So whether or not you kind of go with it you'd always be feeling that's like distance of that convention. Well as someone in the audience I loved it because I felt I could enter that world where I can't enter that world when it's actors playing up being in that world but using another language. You know, so it felt to me like you know the thing I love about what I consider like world cinema when I'm not watching mainstream films and I'm made in the UK America is the fact that I see a slice of reality that isn't open to me otherwise. And that's what I got from this why I was thrilled that you you did make that choice. Yeah I think that's the that was the that was the decision to try and hold some of that integrity of the film I suppose to allow people into private spaces you know to allow people in these tiny communities in a village in Malawi who are discussing whether their child can go to school but to feel as if we are really in that room with them and those are kind of the conversations that seems so distant but obviously we also have those conversations and so that sort of understanding that you know very specific individual. Choices and challenges but also relating that to these kind of wider contexts and to ourselves and so on with something that I felt the film could really offer it felt that's what I felt when I was reading the book that I kind of Alison Wanderland slid down the rabbit hole and entered into this other space and I kind of felt like it would be special for an audience to have access to those kinds of things as well. Shooting Malawi I imagine most of the post some challenges that you wouldn't encounter if you shot somewhere where there was already the infrastructure for moving like this yeah that's true you know I'm Malawi. Nobody made a film of this kind of size anything like this kind of size before in Malawi so that there was no real infrastructure for making films. There's not really a film department in terms of the sort of government you know it's we went through the tourist board you know the tourist section of the government. So there really isn't any sort of foundation for that kind of thing which was challenging you know we had to bring in all of our equipment from Nairobi and from South Africa some of that got held up we had those kinds of complications just because it was crossing a lot of borders all the trucks all these sorts of things and we had a lot of logistical process but we'd all decided you know just myself obviously my producers were working alongside me and then the wider kind of executive and financing teams had all kind of decided which is the BBC the BFI participant you know that we were going to we were going to make the film in Malawi that it was going to be the way to sort of tell this story to tell it authentically. That choice with all of its complications meant that we really had the wind in our backs once we started shooting because the sort of the people really rallied behind it you know and that positive energy you know was just invaluable to the process so for all of the complications that we had with the sort of stuff you know all of that was balanced or sort of nullified by the energy and engagement of the people in Malawi. It does give you know it gives the film such a feeling of authenticity you know you're watching this film playing out where the actual story took place I mean it's a and and just exquisite photography and beautiful scenery as well I mean really beautiful I was wondering whether you obviously one of the things that the film turns upon is the challenges that local people face just due to the weather system did you fight that as well or were you fairly lucky. Well we had some complications with that you know because we were trying to shoot before the rains came and and so in a way we were you know we had obviously as much data we could get about when the rains were coming but it's always it's changeable you know because the nature of weather patterns are changing and so we were you know I think I mean people do this on every film anyway but you know the amount of time we just spent staring at the sky. It was enormous so there was that there were the you know the sorts of the sorts of challenges about and obviously we were doing parts of the film take place in place at different stages of weather and so we were trying to balance all of those different things and that kind of push and pull. And is this where you're heading now you're going to direct more because presumably I mean obviously it's as I said it's a thoroughly satisfying film I think you've been it's been well received as far as I can see I know it's not actually out as we speak but it seems to be very obvious so is this how you see yourself going or you're happy to step back into you know acting as the primary function. Yeah I think it's a balance you know I think it's all about stories about the stories that one can tell and and their kind of and their and their relevance I was very very fortunate on this process you know to find a story that I fell in love with so deeply that I was so passionate about and that you know even though it took the best part of a decade to go from reading the book to being you know to the point where the film is about to come out all of that felt satisfying all of that felt necessary and engaging and. But I feel like you need to really care about a project you need to deeply care about it and and it has to sort of deeply reflect who you are in your own view of the world and your you know values or whatever you know like and and this really did all of those things you know for me so in a way that's what I would look for in terms of things that I write and direct but you're seeing this kind of a serious person which is not in any way me saying and negative thing but I guess it can be interpreted that way you know some people get you to being. So I think that's not too much of a serious person obviously and your work is informed by that even when you make mainstream you're paying things on like Dr Strange for example you approach it very seriously I can see that. Yeah no I do and you take the grumpy well I mean you're not the you're the kind of you're the you're the kind of what's the word of the pain in the us. Yeah yeah no exactly no that's what really attracted me to that part. I'm not playing here. Yeah it's not a new sense. I can really get my teeth into it. No I think yeah no I think that it is something that I am I'm engaged with with drama I'm engaged with storytelling on in a certain way and where it hits. Because even kinky boots is actually quite an important story. Yeah yeah I think that was really important actually and I think it was sort of before it's time in many ways kinky boots as a film. Yeah and you know and we were and I think you know our media has the capacity to to allow people to think about certain things in different ways or confirm certain things that they were thinking or change certain positions and I and I enjoy that and I enjoy going into storytelling in that way and I feel like it should be engaging and challenging and all of those things and it should be fun you know as well. But I like the fun and the drama and the comedy you know to come out of something sort of tangible. A truth yeah yeah I think so. You've played a slave twice I think is that why in movies Amistad and 12 years of slave? Yeah I mean technically I suppose you know but James Covey and Amistad was not enslaved. But we're talking about a slave film. What I want to ask you is as a person of color playing someone in that position whether or not obviously there must be a kind of fury in an anger that I think all of us feel when we look back or one hopes most people would feel when you look at that but I wonder whether for you there was a greater connection whether you felt you were surprised by what you felt about yourself or that situation when you were caught upon to bring those mental life. Yeah I think you just for me I was always struck by the kind of levels of injustice that can happen in the world and obviously the levels of injustice that happened around that particular period of time are just infrequently repeated in in history and although they are repeated but infrequently thankfully the and so they're extraordinary moments and an extraordinary decisions made in the world. So I think that decisions made in ways that treat people in this fashion and so yeah so researching that film being in Nigeria knowing I was at the slave museum in Nigeria in Calabar just before starting to shoot 12 years of slave it was sort of I was finishing a film in Nigeria and then traveling to Louisiana and I stopped in the slave museum and so just understanding that that the people that were put on those boats were me you know was very important that I that I was there. That I had that journey you know that that is that I'm deeply connected to those events and they are painful and you know and they are difficult to engage when to even to fully comprehend to fully understand but that's why it's important to tell those stories and in the hope that people that everybody sort of understands that the level of injustice the capacity that does not exist. So I think that people have that human beings have to inflict these terrible systems and terrible structures and to be wary of anything and anyone that tries to promote these kinds of ideas you know and these kinds of inequalities in people. 12 years of slave obviously it's a very I mean it's a gaulling watch and it's a painful watch but it's also at the end you know it's kind of a it's somewhat uplifting I mean it's certainly there's a resolution there which one helps for and I was talking a few years ago about Jenkins about his new movie which is obviously set deals with injustice but a much more insidious and modern form of injustice harder to pin down in some ways although it's quite obviously apparent but he managed to find I don't know if you've seen Bill Street yeah. He managed to find that that has something of an uplifting ending as well against all the odds and I wonder how important you think that is to actually encourage people to see a movie obviously but to leave them with some hope these days rather than just tell an unvanished version of the truth or a more simplistic version of truth in which we do have to just come out shaking our heads and feeling massively depressed. Yeah I think it's important to reflect I mean I think as a as an actor and as a filmmaker you know I think it's important to reflect your own values and your own view of the world and and I'm an optimist myself and I'm sure Barry Jenkins is to and that film is it relates all the starkness and all the difficulties but it's certainly an optimistic feel and it's optimistic all the way through it and there is a lesson in there that that love is part of the solution and I think that that is. Obviously the way that he sees the world it's to some degree the way that I see the world and I'm sort of a practical optimist in many ways as well and I actually do think that that's why William Camp Wamba story is so important to me because it was a practical solution and I feel like we can live in the solution we can explain and express the problems that we face but I feel like we should also engage in living in the solution to those problems identifying solutions and moving towards them and I and I feel like that is why. The story to me was very hopeful the story to me was very optimistic in the end you know and that's what I hope people take away when they come out of seeing the film is that there is there is possibility there is hope you know and and that's what we that's what we should engage with. I think if I don't want to say a tiny bit of a spoiler here and that it's not intentional but if the pumps in the film hadn't worked I'd have been really pissed off with you for making that film. So of course I guess people know in advance this is going to be an okay story in that respect at least and that isn't exclusively what the film is about of course you wait it's about the strength of family the bond of family the connection the need to actually put yourself into risky situations for those around you but it is I guess it would help to sell that movie to people knowing okay it turns out okay. Yeah sure I mean I think I mean I sort of hope that people have the idea that it's that it's that there's a positivity to the film and and that's the thing that I really wanted to engage with and that's what brought me to the to the to the book even you know that I just I was aware that it was a story that is coming out of obviously these really difficult circumstances of a famine but looking at a famine from inside the experience what might it feel like to be inside the experience of the famine but very often we see these things. And we often we see these images and understand them from the outside looking at people and it's this sort of point of view. Well you know what really do we see it on the human scale and we see it as an event we see it from a distance and that sort of like and it's depersonalized and therefore it's harder for us to connect to and we see it whereas to actually be there in the room with them while they're planning out how the how is the food they have going to last going forward how they're going to survive until they can get more food I thought was very powerful but also something I didn't feel like seen before. Yeah that was part of the part of the energy of the film was to really to try and take the POV inside the experience and thereby take the audience inside the experience and and and have that sense of well what choices would I make would I make the same choices as this family would I make different choices and maybe all of those choices are explored in the film all the choices that one would make are also explored in the film and where those lead to and so that's part of really engaging I think people globally you know and that's one of the great things about it being going out on Netflix is that it's a conversation that can happen globally about issues such as this and what different communities do I'm fully got made I'm filled with on Netflix my own the down side was this is really I say this because I'm quite lazy as you know I don't like to go out if I can avoid it but I would like to see not a big screen I didn't get the chance to be screen I saw on the middle quite a large screen I've got here but it was on a TV screen and and the the cinematography and the kind of way that you use the film and I'm going to do that. I was thinking about the landscape I think would really have landed on me even more on a bigger screen so it will it be something actually as well yes it will so it's there is a theatrical release here in the UK and also in the US a limited theatrical release but still but it's still going to be in the cinema as if people want to see it. I mean Roma a lot of people want to see Roma on the screen yeah it was great I'm not going to have to name names but we speak if we're speaking about the films which are relentlessly depressing. Which is one is you ever seen one where you think that's it I don't want to ever see another film again that film was so horrible experience I've seen a few I can tell you which ones in a minute Well, I've never seen a film because it's been depressing No, not you didn't go and see it because it was depressing I mean what you learned in to see a film and then halfway through you think this is so depressing I don't want to see cinema anymore. Yeah, no, I've never had quite that I mean I that's it Let me recommend a couple of genres of film that I don't that I'm never ever seen so it's fun to do avoid which genres you know I do tend to avoid the sort of horror film like Fright Night genre Oh really? Well, even like kind of like jumpy ones or do you mean like that's the torture ones Well, but the torture ones I avoid I've got no appetite for those anymore like come on guys That's not show the season of fun the torture ones specifically I think are kind of you know But then they sort of bleed into me for the for those sort of jumpy ones as well and that so even a jumpy one like like like Halloween You wouldn't go and see I don't think I've seen Halloween Yeah, wow did you see get out? Yeah, but that didn't strike me as a jumpy But that is something different to say exactly that's some good jump scares in here. I thought yeah I don't know it didn't hit me in that way, but it felt more sort of I don't know it didn't it felt like it was doing something So what about when genre films that that bleed into even if it's a fairly superficial political Commentary like the purge did you gonna see the purge? I didn't see the person and what and you let me just Do you deliberately avoid seeing the purge? I think I do wow yeah, I think I do I think I don't know what it is exactly I think because I think I saw I think what it happened was I saw Nightmare on Alamed Street too young How are you? I think I was maybe eight. I was too young there you are and and I think it's how it happened Where were you? I think it was just in a VHS put being played someone's house probably your house May have been your mum did this to you I think she's watching she was very careful moment with what I was watching on the television But for some you know the details are hazy, but you put on a member who wants to see you might Yeah, I would have I would have I would have pushed to try and watch it and then I think I did It may have been something to do with my brother. I'm not naming name how old is your body? He's three years older than me. Well, that's it. This 11-year-old. Yeah, I think he's got a lot of answer for He certainly does I would call him but he's at home watching a Halloween box set. He loves the But yeah, so I think it just you know it shifted something in my psychology. Yeah, and so what films do you actively seek out? I mean so many. I don't I mean it's sort of I think I just feel that the films that lull me into You know just into a state with their storytelling with the poetic quality of them, you know that's why you know I had a great time watching Alfonso Quarance film. Yeah, Roma and that and ambiel street, you know that that films that are poetic and tell big stories and relate These kind of big lives and have something to say and something beautiful and a beautiful palette and template to say it I think it's just deeply engaging, you know on car why who is you know extraordinary filmmaker and is able to do that time and time again these sort of big canvases these poetic stories but sometimes very Focus as well almost always focused actually on the on the intimate totally These yeah, relationships. So when you were a kid that what movies did you enjoy? We've established now that you were too chicken to watch So what kind of movies did you seek out as a young person? Well my my tastes were kind of you know I would always say that my favorite film the film that I would watch over and over again if I could on a loop was back to the future You know that I felt like my favorite films were the ones that I could almost you know I think people do relate this you know that you could turn down the sound and follow the story entirely because they were so Visually expressive and so fully telling this the tale and But I loved all of that. I loved all of the kind of you know those that era of kind of I mean I've loved all of his film that fun blockbuster kind of yeah The Spielbergian kind of reach of Of youth and so when you worked with Spielberg did you did you which of your which of his films was your favorite? Which one did you want a fanboy over with Steven Spielberg and you many? Well really it was jaws for me, you know that Was the first time I think because jaws was the first time that I didn't only understand the nature of Film in terms of you know sort of storytelling in that way but also I understood screenwriting for the first time the way the story is put together The way the information is is released about what is happening about the nature of the shark how it's important for this community Not to have a problem you know because they're trying to encourage stories of into this small area It's interesting because we go back to what we've been talking about in your work as a director now But also films you like is still Spielberg find space in that film for the intimate I mean my favorite scene in that movie it may well be yours What I don't know is the same between boy shine only some Pagely when he's in the midst of the drama and really struggling me what to do in this position of responsibility And then his son starts mimicking me and there's a beautiful moment of real kind of human truth Yeah, it's a wonderful. That's a wonderful scene and and that in its moments like that that really stay with you all your life really Those kind of deeply poetic human moments of cinema And I think that yeah finding that capturing that telling those stories Things that really made an impression on me when I was When I was growing up and when I was falling in love with with films and then you know And then you know from that point films becoming into that scorsese area You know and that and really understanding the sort of stretch of films in terms of raging bull and you know And then I remember watching Spike Lee's do the right thing and Understanding the kind of the political Area that film could enter into the story entertaining. I mean that's the amazing thing about a lot of spikes work is he pulls off the two of them there So serenity I need to talk to you about this. Oh, yeah I love that movie and I hadn't seen Firefly the TV show and I'm assuming you probably hadn't either when you signed on had you? I hadn't no well. I sort of it was around it was when they after they sent me serenity To um to look at I then was so curious about it that I then watched Um, Firefly what amazing so a lot in no My first proper binge watch was serenity. It's the problem Firefly one of the best shows ever made. Yeah, and then Netflix and I know we've been nice about Netflix here But you know what Netflix did one year? I don't Netflix one years a practical joke on April the first set you ever one We're doing the second season You laugh it It's a serious and unpleasant thing they Why would they do that? Why would they do that? Yeah, you know people there now But serenity's an amazing film didn't do as well. I think as people hope because it didn't I suppose he didn't have that kind of star wars audience and and in many ways He's slightly more complex a piece of work storytelling specifically the character you playing it Yeah, I mean, maybe it's one of these other moments that is slightly that was slightly before its time or at least Was part of moving cinema in a certain direction, you know, I feel like something like serenity now would be huge I think he probably would you know be a massive deal So um and it was big in its time don't get me wrong, but it was it definitely could have been bigger But yeah, no, I I loved it. I thought that and I think just weed and is you know incredible film I could watch it again again and Dr. Strange you did you're back in the set of another Dr. Strange soon? Well, I hope yeah Let's see let's see how that see that how how I go. What is that what sort of answer is that? Let's hope I've asked you a very specific question. Yeah, are you doing another Dr. Strange so not let's do you hope to do another film in your life? Well, let's let's see what's the other? No, no, let's see. What's the actual answer? Do you know yes? Are you or no you don't that is the answer? Let's Let's engage with what the future brings as it brings it so so there's no specific news you can give us at this moment That's exactly right. Okay, but I mean you and Benedict together and you've known each other for a long time. Yeah, yeah We know each other for a while. Yeah, so you're pretty close friends To see you guys on screen doing that will be good and do you know what you're doing next after this? I know you've been devoting yourself to talking about this film and and spreading the word about this and and I do genuinely recommend you watch I loved it. I will happily and I think I'll probably watch it again because my wife didn't see it and I think you love it too So we'll probably watch it again, but what's next for you is it more acting more directing? Do you know what your next project is or is it going to be a let's hope kind of answer? This is a let's hope kind of answer so the I guess I'm going to carry on Working with the boy one is the wind and that's gonna come out pretty soon and then there's a film coming out called the Lion King Which is oh yeah, you know you're scarring on you. Yeah, that's right. So that's happening this year So I guess for me it's sort of part of that as well and and I'll be doing some writing and stuff like that Have you seen have you seen what they've done to Will Smith in the yeah, the Aladdin like I did say I saw a photograph Yeah, I mean that's terrifying. It's a serious business. Who's he upset for them to do that to him? Let's hope Yeah, they don't do that for me in every film Exactly This is not the the blueprint. Yeah, thank you. Thank you very much at the back once again the boy harness the wind A lovely a really beautiful film a beautiful made Exquisitely acted and just fabulous make sure you say it if you get the chance to sit on the big screen I think that would be even more rewarding than the opportunity You have ready to see it on your television screen thanks to Netflix of course should still be apologizing for saying that we're going to do another series of firefly to tell great to see you again Thank you so much for coming thanks.

      "text": "Hey, hey, hey, time to put your mirror to the desk now. On, on, on, on, on. Hey, hey, hey, do it you know. You know what you're doing the best now. Oh, oh, oh, oh. So I've never read that home stuck or anything, but it does have a better version of Megalovania. Yeah, that Megalovania was a song from from from Homestuck before and here's the thing. I'll say this is a person who has gone through all of Homestuck and enjoyed going through all of Homestuck. I would never recommend anyone ever try and engage with Homestuck. It is it is a frighteningly inaccessible piece of media that goes on and on and on and on and on and on and yeah from what I know from what I was looking up. It's like, well, 800,000 words a very complicated plot. Yeah, no, it's like it is the most complicated narrative thing I have ever tried to wrap my head around. Like, you know, people talk about Kingdom Hearts and they go, oh, it's a big long convoluted complicated plot. No, Kingdom Hearts has fucking nothing on Homestuck. I love Homestuck, but fuck you Homestuck. You are not, you are not a well edited piece of media. It's a, it's a web comic for anyone who isn't aware. Toby Fox has had some like involvement with it. I was waiting for the explanation. But what is it? What, what is this exactly? Is it a game? Yeah. It's a web comic from the mid 2000s that like it had the weirdest update schedule. It would sometimes update like multiple times a day and then go multiple months without updating at all. And it had a lot of like very video gamey interactive elements going on with it, but it was basically a web comic. Yeah, like from what I've looked, I actually started looking at it just before we started recording. I can already tell that this is something I'm just going to get upset by just trying to get a handle on it because I'm too old for this shit now. But it's only looks like the kind of thing that could only exist within the media, I'm it seeing. So one of those ones that just takes full advantage of the fact it can take the form of animations and video gamey things. Yeah. It is weird that Megalovania, like it was the third, I think the third time it got used, that it finally picked up and became a big thing. But it'd been it'd been in Homestuck. It was in some Undertale Halloween fan mod. It was an earthbound, yeah, an earthbound Halloween hack, I think it was called. Earthbound, sorry, yeah, yeah, yeah, earthbound, or did I say something else? I think it said Undertale. Undertale, earthbound, I've got my membrane muddled up. It was an earthbound Halloween mod thing. Yeah. Yeah. And then on the third time's the charm, everyone's like, oh, Megalovania is quite good. Yeah, it's something of a Toby Fox calling card. It's a very good song, of course. I've had to stuck in my head for the past week. So I was playing Undertale. I've had to hit the switch. I played it again and then again. And it's that one of them games that get stuck in your head. Yeah. Although, you know, here's a little space. I'll just chip away a little bit of space in the podcast for people to comment that it's overrated while saying nothing else about it. Yeah. Okay. You can have that just type it in now. Like soundcloud will give you a timestamp so everyone can keep there that Undertale's overrated comments in one little space and we'll get on with the rest of the show. Welcome to podcast position. I'm Jim Sterling. I am joined by I'm going to introduce Gavin first because then we'll talk about what Laura wants to talk about. Oh, yeah, me, me, me thing, me thing that I'm going to go high jack the show in a minute. Indeed. Gavin, how are you, dear sir? I'm good, not too bad. I've been obsessively playing Assassin's Creed Odyssey all week. Nice, nice. Yeah. Yeah, I played a bit of that. We'll talk about that later. We'll talk about that later though. We're going to all, we're going to have a big disagreement on this one. I love a bit of a disagreement on this one. I'm just going to sit back and let you two argue this one out. I'm just going to be like, ah, here we go. Time for a nap. I've made, I'm not interested in arguing. I've made my arguments. I argued with the fucking voice actor Gavin's friend, I believe, who allows to fix this? I think so, yeah, yeah, because he was in my threads. Well, I'm not interested in arguing either. We can disagree without arguing. Oh, yeah, yeah. We have a polite debate while I have a nap. We'll have a little discussion about it. We don't even have to debate. We can just feel about it different ways and that's fine. No, give me a fight. This is what the incident demands. You have to be in complete. You can't have differing opinions. I'm still like each other. Yeah, goddammit. I need to let everyone know what details overrated. By the way, here's some advice. Never get mentioned in one of Jim's videos as someone who bought a micro transaction. Oh, I'm sorry. I was using you as an example of someone who, like, I need to reference that someone has said what I suspected. Oh, god. I'm sorry about that. That's all right. People don't bother people. None of it was too abusive. Just, oh, I'm very disappointed and gout. This seems to be against his message. I'm like, what fucking message? My only message is I want to make fucking songs and play some fun games. I'm not a consumer advocate, OK? Yeah, Gavin's on a very different track from, like, from me when it comes to, you know, a lot of that stuff. I'm a fucking horror. I love getting my free games and all this shit, you know, just, you know, take me on these more of these trips. You be soft, give me all the free shit. I'll take it all, you know. Yeah, Gavin's got no problem with that kind of stuff. That should be clear if you listen to the podcast. So if you're disappointed, I'm not going to say you're like those Nazis who are upset at Taylor Swift now because she came out as not a Nazi because they just assumed. But you're in the same bullpark of basically projecting your beliefs onto a musician who hasn't said Jack while while the other. And that said, I cannot defend selling XB as a booster. I still think it's kind of crappy. I mean, yeah, I mean, you said that on the last podcast. You said you didn't feel good about doing it. But I am not a person with a lot of spare time on my hands and, you know, I have to get a song done about this game and I want to finish it. And, you know, is the thing. It's not contradictory to simultaneously hold the beliefs that it is shitty to balance a game in such a way that players would need to buy a micro transaction to feel like they are getting the correct pacing. But equally, if you've already bought that video game and you're enjoying it other than the pacing and there is a micro transaction that will fix the pacing. If you were already given that video game for free. Yeah. And you're like, you know what? I would like, I would like to enjoy this game more and there is a way to do so. It's not contradictory to buy that and to also think it's shitty that you have to buy that. Yeah, especially when it's your work, you know. Yeah. I think WWE does a bunch of things that are shitty. I still watch it every week and I feel terrible for doing it. Right. So, yeah, we took a bit more about it as a degree, don't see in a bit. But first, I'll basically hand over to Laura because Laura has promoted things to do. From what I've seen of what's coming up, I'm very excited. It looks fantastic. But, hello, Laura, Laura Dyle. Hey! Prolific at this point. Prolific writer. What's cooking, please? So, I've been, I've been fucking teasing this for ages and I can finally fucking talk about it properly because by the time this podcast goes up, this should be up. I have a book called Things I Loved From Mario's But, which is a 40,000 word illustrated coffee table book, a video game character butt reviews, and then really good art of the butts of those characters. It's really good. It's all original art done by an artist called Zack Flavin. You can find them on Twitter at FlavinFlavin. And basically, the book is a thing. I've been working on it for a while. I'm super excited about the artist. I've got a bunch of guests that are doing things contributing little bits to it. Jim is doing a little thing for the books. Jim's probably going to have, there's a little picture of Jim's face that is going to be in the book next to some words. Nice brilliant. Let me find my list. Where's my list of people that I've, I've so far got contributing stuff to this book because I got really excited about it. So I've got stuff from Jim Sterling's that we quin just in McElroy, Brian Altano, Max Scoville, Brenton Floss, Greg Miller, Tim Getty's, Dan Bull, Dodger and Stewart Aschens. I currently have agreed to do stuff for a book about butts. Nice. That's a great list. Yeah, I'm, I'm pretty excited about it. And what are they all, like, is it, they talk about their favourite video game butts, is it? Yeah, yeah, it's just going to be like, most of the book is going to be me talking about video game character butts that I think are narratively interesting and why. And then there's going to be, I think it's about 10, 10 also guests that are just going to do a little, little section of, here's a butt and a quite like. I'm, I'm curious to know who Dan's one is. Oh, okay, so I, yeah, it's, it's not, it's not a traditional video game but by any means the idea that he has suggested. So we'll get there. But yeah, no, it's, it's a stupid idea that like, seriously, like four years ago, this came up on my Facebook timeline recently. Four years ago, I made a Facebook post going, does anyone know what the legal status is? If I want to make a book about video game character butts and like, can I just use screenshots? Do I have to get an artist? What's the deal? This is like an idea I had years ago and I'm getting it published through a company called Unbound who have been amazing at being really helpful. They have been putting together samples, paged layouts and shit that I've, I've got to see today, they look really cool. I have like the whole framework for the book is set up and it's sort of, it is ready to go full steam ahead on writing. I just have to get the sort of go ahead of, yep, yep, let's go. Let's do this. And basically, you can, you can pre-order a copy of that book like starting today. Basically the thing with Unbound is they are a publisher where it's like, hey, put the book up for pre-orders with a bunch of like examples of his, what the book is, his all the sample text and all this stuff like that. X number of pre-orders, they do a production run, my book gets to exist. So, if you go to unbound.com, forward slash books, forward slash things I learned from Mario's butt with hyphens in between each of the words or just check my twitches, probably between a pinned tweet right now, twinned peat. My pinned tweet right now is probably about this. There is, there is a video, I'm super proud of this little video I made for it. There's a bunch of examples of art, a video game character butts, art of the people who are going to be contributing stuff to the book. Go, go put some money down and go, hey, yeah, yeah, I want to book about video game character butts. Yeah, yeah, I want to own this physical thing. That there are various tiers like starting with like just a digital ebook of the book up to the top end where like up at the top end you can pay an amount of money to tell me what butt to write about and to get drawn and I will write about it, I will write about that butt. Dancer of the Boreal Valley. Oh, if you want to pay the pick a butt tier on my pre-order thing, you can make me draw and talk about that butt gap. That power is within your hands. But yeah, no, I've been working on this for a few months behind the scenes and I've just been like really fucking excited about the artist I found. I'm really super fucking happy with their art. Like they've been knocking shit out the part. They're very cool. They are. I've seen a couple of the drawings and they're very cool. They're amazing. I love them. Yeah, and I'm really happy with like, I've got my structure of like here is all the butt some going to talk about. Here's what I'm going to say about them. I've got it all like, ah, it's guys. I wanted to be a book. They're just that wonderfully right level of cartoony that they slightly over exaggerate the very prominent features of the butts that you remember in your head and make them so you go, oh yeah, I remember that butt. It's like, it's the butt as you remember it, not necessarily how it works. It's how you remember that butt. But yeah, so this is like the first big project thing I have tried to do and I've been nervous about this because like 2018 has been a year of me just working on book stuff. I've mentioned a couple of times before. July next year, I've got a memoir coming out. This is the first time I've able to be like, here is a book. I've been working on it. Do you want to buy it? So I hope the time I have put into this year is worth it and the people like this idea. So things I learned from Mario's butt, go check that out on Unbound and give it a look because I've been working really hard on it this year. That's great. Yeah, there you go. That's shameless, shill corner, but I got very excited because yeah, because we've been talking a bit on this show like every now and then we talk about like, hey, the things we did as our bread and butter career wise, it's getting harder and harder to make them pay the bills. This has been the thing I've spent this year going, okay, I'll do a new thing and see how that goes. It's valuable. So I'm excited that I can finally do the whole like, hey, that's what I've been doing this year. Go look at it. Yeah, no, it's impressive. It's fantastic to see. You're right. Doing something different is if you can do it, fantastic. I've been looking into various things as well. You just got to diversify more than ever lately. It's been great seeing these books happen and the publishing deal has been great and the butt book looks fantastic so far. So I think it's going to be, it's going to work out fantastically for you. That's the hope. Anyway, I've done enough shill corner. Should we get on with the show at large now that I've been like, maybe, maybe, maybe. At least you're shilling for your book, Laura, and not micro transactions. Oh, very disappointed in you, Kevin. Well, you can pay a small amount additional amount and I will draw a button the front of your book alongside signing it, which I suppose is a micro transaction, but pay for my micro transaction where I draw a button your book. I have to say this about Jim's audience, at least when they're disappointed with you, they're nice about it and they don't like come screaming into your mansion calling you a cock. Yes, nice. Yeah, for the most part. Yeah. How about you busy calling Jim the cock? Well, yes, some of them. I've shaved away some of that stuff, thankfully. So yeah, that's one, one section of audience I'm glad about losing. Taylor Swift is taking your place now. Yeah. Oh, God. Her career's over. Oh, she's still worth millions. Donald Trump said he likes music 25% less, so that's what cylinder she's not going to sell anymore. I could not resist last night. This is something I saw on Twitter some right wing guy saying your career never recovered since Kanye ended it. And I just had to point this out. It's like she's the second biggest selling artist of the decade after Adele. Her album last year, I would sold everything else on the billboard at the time together, combined. She just finished a world tour that was completely sold out. She's doing all right. Yeah. The facts don't matter. She has more followers than Donald Trump. She'll be all right. She's bigger than Kanye, who it's arguable like launched her career by doing that. Yeah. That was a big moment with a lot of people like, oh, Taylor Swift, who's that? And yeah, I read some amazing theories about why for those who don't know, for some reason the alt-rike decided she was their Aryan goddess, who one day was going to reveal her right wing Nazi philosophies to the world. And then she supported some Democrats because, well, a lot of people are disgusted with what's been going on with the geriatric old prex that otherwise known as the GOP. And so she basically came out as not a Nazi and people felt betrayed that their invented comic book version of her isn't real. The best theory I read was she's getting old and doesn't have kids. And therefore this old, old 28 year old woman is now bitter and angry and lashing out. And that's why she is betrayed the alt-rike. She's a year older than me. Yeah. She's fucking younger than me. Yeah. Oh goodness. So video game you ship from this week. A couple of bits of news we have this week. You know, every recently we've had a few bits of news about like games getting streamed to things like Resident Evil and Assassin's Creed Odyssey that you can stream to your Switch in Japan or their testing that you'd be able to play Assassin's Creed Odyssey in your Chrome browser and things like that. Oh, they're not streaming presidential tweets to everybody's switch, are they? Oh, I wouldn't have to worry about that being in the UK. Thank the Lord. They're streaming them to the game and if you want to not get them, you can buy Helix points. Ah, ah. So there was there was a thing that was kind of teased at E3 this year and like everyone assumed this was going to be fucking years off. Microsoft during their Xbox press conference were like, hey, so we've got people working on tech to like let you play Xbox games if you don't have the hardware in your own home. And they announced this week they were like, no, yeah, no, we're like trialing that starting in 2019 that you'll just be able to play any Xbox game on like a phone, a tablet, an iPad, anything that's got an internet connection and a screen just fucking connect your controller to it via Bluetooth or touch screen, play your Xbox games everywhere. So I was a bit dubious to this when I heard it because I'm like, we talked about PlayStation now a couple of weeks ago being like, it's never really worth streaming games. It's just like never been good. I don't know whether this is real, but I think it was the verge when and like talked to them about this and apparently they're like, no, you, we've we've done the tech that you can like have a like free gaming experience on just like a 4G phone connection. It's like, oh, that's real, that's a pro consumer thing, I guess. Still wouldn't work here in this city. Comcast wouldn't make that shit work. We got something wrong about that recently actually. We thought that Red Dead Redemption would have been downloadable, but apparently the PS3 era games are not. Yeah, I found that out the fucking hard way. Yeah, so this was breaking when we recorded that episode of The Podcast is PlayStation now stuff that is PS4 games or PS2 games. You can download onto the PS4 and play offline. You can't do it with the PS3 ones. But all the ones you actually want are not. Yeah, everything I wanted. So I apologise, that was, I failed to catch that when like grabbing the news things. Yeah, that's an easy one to miss. Yeah, happens. Yeah, I was, I just saw all the headlines if you can download PS now games and I was like, oh yeah, fuck yeah, this is brilliant, this is what I needed. But yeah, no, like it was an interesting bit of news just because like, Microsoft's they've been doing a lot recently to make it much easier to get their games without having to buy dedicated hardware. Oh yeah, I mean if they actually like came out with some more compelling games to take advantage of it, it'd be fantastic. Yeah, well his is what I was thinking about the other day was I was like, if Sony was doing all the stuff that Microsoft has been doing like outside of the actual making first party games, we would be heralding them as fucking like the console manufacturer of all time. Like imagine if the PS4, every PS4 game also came to PC, they released a specially designed controller for people with disabilities that was like modifiable and adaptable. They talked about like, hey, even if you don't own a PC or a PS4, you'll be able to get the games like functionally running in a year or so like on your phone if you want to. We'd be like, that's amazing, this is fantastic. Like it's only because it's only because Microsoft doesn't have the games. Yeah, Xbox has made, it's made really good strides in accessibility and everything around the games, but I just don't care about any of it because I don't care about what they've got on the software side right now. I mean, it can always change, but this is it that they're making amazingly pro consumer moves that I just don't care about because what the fuck am I actually going to play on it? Because I don't want to consume anything there. Yeah, because like the way they were trying to pitch this streaming to tablets and phones futures, they were like, look, it's honestly kind of shitty that like to buy a big triple A first party video game that comes out. You need to buy a special machine just to play that game. You wouldn't accept that out of movies and music. Surely we should try and make some way that just like regardless of what device you happen to have, you can play the game. And I'm like, that's that's that's the positive thing in right there. Yeah, you don't have anything I want to play. Yeah, I mean, I've probably played Gears 5. Yeah. But I don't know, I just, the trailers for that even don't kind of just want Marcus to be the main character again. Well, Gears 4, I like was a good game, but as a Gears of War experience and what I was opening for, I was fairly disappointed by it. I still recognise it was good and well made, but I didn't grab me. The younger characters to me just aren't as fun, yeah, as interesting as Marcus and Dom and their big meat sack heads. My feelings about most of like Microsoft's game library is that all polished games that just don't get me excited anymore and I don't know why. Like I, I can't deny that like the latest that Halo 4 was like better and more polished than Halo 3. It was like, it was a better made video game. I didn't care as much about it. Halo 4, better than Halo 3. Woof, that's a, that's a controversial one. Okay, okay, I'm not saying it was a better game. It was a better made game on a technical level of like, I think that like, you know, games are getting better and more polished and I just cared less about them. Yeah, this was the root of a falling out I had with Cliff Blizzinski, Waiipa, Wen, we fences mended now, but he couldn't comprehend that I would give Giz of War 3 a lower score than Giz of War 2 when I was doing scored reviews because it was technically better. And I'm, you know, I was trying to argue that being technically a better game doesn't make it for a better production, a better experience. Yeah, just because it's a technically better game doesn't mean that I liked it more. Yeah, you know, the story didn't grab me so much. It was a lot less special because it was the third in the series. The lamp I never found interesting. Giz, I actually know Giz 1 is probably still my favourite in the series, but Giz 2, I definitely remember like in that more than the third. It might be mine too, but you know what Xbox, you know what Xbox 1 game jumps to mind for me when I try and think of like Xbox One games that I think back on really fondly. The one that's jumping to mind is Recall and that wasn't a well made game, but it was new, it was different, it was something interesting. It was a good, again, similar to Giz 4, it was a good game, not one that grabbed me long term, but you're right, at least it was something different. The only Xbox One exclusive that kind it has me interested for next year is Ari and the Will of the West. Yeah, it's the stuff that I get interested about with Xbox is when they make smaller, more experimental things that aren't just here's another big angry shooter. I like the Ori games. Cuphead was good, that was a small thing. If you've got Recall, which wasn't particularly polished, but it's something interesting they did. Wasn't a bad game by any means. Cuphead by the way was a very big success, and it was like... Glad it was. Both critical and commercial as far as I know. Yeah. The one that still breaks my heart that they lost was, was it Scalebound? Scalebound? That's so good. Yeah, they cancelled that off. I got really excited for Scalebound. That was the thing where I was like, I'll keep an Xbox around for this. That was compelling, but yeah, too compelling apparently. Shut that down, we've got to get Super fucking lucky to tell you I'll say one thing, after nearly six years, Crackdown 3 better be fucking good. Yeah, it'd be nice. It's like it was announced in 2014, so five years. Well, I will say I liked, and I'm one of the few people that really, really enjoyed it. Like, enough people liked it, but I genuinely really liked Quantum Break. I didn't like that game at all. Quantum Break was was pretty good actually. I'll give it that. I forgot. It was a forgettable experience, but now I think of it. I'm like, yeah, that was pretty good. The live action stuff was a bit too extravagant. I played two levels and stopped, which is really rare for me. Yeah. Well, yeah. So we got a couple of other bits and newsy stuff before we get into games we played. Updates on Telltale news. They fired the rest of their staff, that like Skeleton crew they had left have been fired now. Fucking slime. So have you heard what they're doing with the end of the Telltale, the Walking Dead's final season? Yeah. None of it involves paying the hundreds of people Telltale's money too. Let's just get that out the fucking way. Yeah, it is the thing. Basically, Robert Kirkman's development company star something or other. I forgot the fucking name now. Robert Kirkman's development company is basically going to their handing over the Walking Dead to them and going, okay, finish it off. The positive is they are going to be looking to hire Telltale staff to finish it. So that's like some people who worked at Telltale will have an opportunity to do some work and finish off that project and to have some work for a few months while they find what they're going to do next. Yeah. But it doesn't change the fact that like the the financial situation is very confusing because it's like, well, okay, if additional people now buy that final season of the Walking Dead, does that money, where does it go first? Does it go first to the company that just got handed the license? Does it go to the people who are developing the new game? Does it go to the severance pay that should have been paid to the Telltale staff? Well, let me have a think and maybe I'm just being overly cynical. But the idea that money trickles down seems to be a bit fallacious. I guess suggesting trickle down economics is not a thing. I fucking say this much for all the people that lost their jobs and are now trying to find stuff to keep their lights on. Something tells me the executives who fucked it all up and fucked everyone over are not going cap in hand looking for money to keep their lights on and pay their bills. Yeah. Something tells me they made out of it just fucking fine. Here's like, I've got complicated thoughts on this because I've been I've been really enjoying that final season of the Walking Dead and I finished the second episode recently, it ended in a really compelling place. I already have that game. It's not like I'm choosing at this point halfway through the season to give them money after all this stuff has happened. It's being worked on by people from Telltale, people from that pool of people who were fired and they are going to get some money out of it. I don't know that I feel bad about finishing playing that series. I would not give Telltale a single fucking penny more of my money now. But I'm in a position where I'm like, I don't know if this is necessarily fair with me, but I feel like this was the minimum they they had to do for me to go, okay I'll I'll play through the last two episodes. I don't think you should feel bad about playing it or even enjoying it. Yeah. Because now now you get to see Clementine die a horrible depressing death. Yeah. This is on the heads of the people who fucked it up. It's their responsibility to get people paid. Yeah and this is it is if these last couple of episodes comes out gets a few more months of paid work for those employees and gets them to be able to finish a story they've been telling for a fucking decade. Yeah. Yeah I'll play the end of it. But let nobody believe that's enough. No no. Remember the people who will be hired back will be hired and paid for new work, new labor. Yes. New labor, new danger. That was the unconcerned but fucking before black got in anyway. They're not getting the money there owed still. So yeah. It's not like justice is so you've adore anything. No I understand the the ethical quandary and I totally understand the people who have been saying like I'm not going to play those last episodes regardless as a matter of principle thing. I totally understand the perspective. It's a thing I've been I've been wrestling with whether it is right or wrong to finish playing that series. I don't know. Yeah I don't think you're wrong at all. Yeah. You know the customers job ultimately is to get what they paid for just like you know the telltale developers jobs should have been paid for their work should be paid for and ideally it should be the people who are running telltale's job to pay them. You know that I think I think that dynamic there is fairly straightforward. I don't think anyone should do. Certainly if people have sworn it off and they're like fuck it I won't play good on them. I lost like I even paid for the season the last season of the walking dead but just because I figured I would cover it in some way shape or form eventually but I've lost all interest in touching anything they've ever done again but then I'm not saying anyone else should therefore swear off them. I'm in a weird position where like I was halfway through working on a feature that I still want to make happen at some point which I want to make a comparative feature talking about life is strange season two and the walking dead's final season and basically where we're where we're at in the world that we've had two games come out within like a month of each both very much themed around child looking after younger child and trying to teach them how to survive in an unforgiving world and like they're both very very similar from what I've seen so far and I'm like I'm really I had I had a thing that I was working on I was like yeah I kind of want to see that through but also I I totally stand behind people who are like no I don't want anything to do with telltale at this point yeah so it's it's a big old mess isn't it yeah the gaming industry's fucking disgusting yeah it is at least that the higher up the budget you go yeah you know what's not disgusting there's one little bit of news that was like just not terrible what's that Nintendo has patented a case for like your phone and whatnot a phone case that actually sounds like kind of a cool idea it looks like the front of a game boy but it's got a gap in the front of the case um that like would let you see the screen through the case and then the the buttons on the case are actual working buttons that touch the touch screen through the case so you can have you can play game boy games on your phone huh with actual physical buttons rather than touch screen buttons and a backlit screen that's actually funny that's fun that's actually a kind of cool idea I dread to think what the monetization model for buying game boy games on your phone would be yeah yeah that bits a bit more tricky but I like it principle the idea of of turning my phones touch screen into a physical buttons game boy yeah yeah up up yeah for that so if I already have in my pocket which is like give me physical buttons that I have with me all times for for my phone and let me play Pokemon yellow on the bus yeah I'll do that what's Nintendo's whole thing about old sports games as well the NES on the switch a lot of them are sports games like and that they they're bringing three more out now one of them Solomon's quest if I think I got that name right Solomon's key Solomon's key I think yeah it's Solomon's fucking something yeah and then the other two are more sports games for it I'm not sure what what they're driving at with this there's only one of those got of those sports games that I think is worth a damn which is the the golf game on on the switches NES library is like I have some nostalgia for that golf game most of the games on on their selection aren't worth a damn because they're old NES games that have either been devalued from release after release after release or you know otherwise very easily available elsewhere not that I'm condoning anything golf golf is one of those ones I would never have paid for on the virtual console but give it to me for free and I'll play 45 minutes of that that might be what they're doing like we've got all of these sports games roms and they are roms what are we gonna do with them air just no one's gonna fucking pay for that shit throw it on there yeah we'll charge for some premium ones later that's just me being cynical uh see yeah that's that's an easy bit uh should we talk about that game that Jim has played this week and gas played a lot of and should I let you have the fight fight fight fight that everyone's expecting uh yeah we'll take turns bogwashing each other in the in the boys toilet you played assassins Creed yeah assassins grade that's what I played and was seriously like that game just fuck it just fuck it with ready crew I want to fuck this game I want to make sweet sweet love to this game you love it you love it um there's a wish I wish assassins Creed Odyssey had come out around podcast 200 when we were being honest out shit because then we could put the whole gab loves all the Ubisoft games things in that yeah and we could go ah you love some old ah ah ah ah now now it's one of the one in one in two Ubisoft games that I like yeah yeah um so yeah you love it you've played more of it and you've only likes it more for the first few hours I thought I like this but maybe not as much as origins but I'm no 40 hours in and this game is fucking heroin there's a mechanic that gets revealed uh a little bit further in which I don't really want to spoil but it completely changes the game and it makes it like kind of like a mystery and you have to go hunting down all these different people in ways that are much more interesting than just here's your quest go get it I don't know if you reached that part Laura I think I know the bit you're on about this would be the all the game gets much better XR was in bit yeah I I'm here's the thing I was enjoying the game I was enjoying the game before that but I understand why people were like oh and that's where the game kicks it up a notch I was loving the game before last because yeah it's my kind of thing it's this massive open world with beautiful environments combat's fun the leveling uh it's hard for me to really comment because I bought the boost because you are very disappointing Gavin I'm a very disappointing person but I have to say there've been times where I felt like I was leveling up way too fast now I'll I'll say this like I'll maintain what I said last week I have been playing it without the the XP boost and I feel like I've been I've been leveling it a good rate like I've been enjoying enough of the the the content in that open world that I don't feel like I've been having to do things I didn't want to do in order to get XP yeah I was actually kind of regretting buying it because there have been moments where I'll pick up a new piece of gear and out level it within like 10 minutes and I'm like fuck I really probably shouldn't have bought that stupid boost and they can't get rid of it now I mean that's it's a it's a good tactic you know make the make it grindy of like front load to the grindiness yeah so you by the time you've already bought it they've got the money for it they're like the thing about this game is it really depends on how you play it because if you're it's very easy to have a really boring game in this because there is a lot of guff there's a whole lot of Skyrim style go here fetch this kind of procedural order shite but then there's also an almost endless amount of good quests too so it's just you've got an over abundance of stuff but you have to just pick the good shit and that basically that means picking the character missions not the contracts and bounties yeah that's that's how I've been going through it is I've just been sticking to the stuff that seems like it's gonna give me substantial content rather than the stuff where it's like I can tell from the offset this is gonna be run do a thing run back and just doing the character stuff has been enough to have me leveling properly yeah and there's so many cool little quite like I'm gonna tell you about one quest that was my favorite one I've done and this is a side quest this random side quest I found on on a beach right and it's if you don't want this tiny little side quest spoiled stop listening now for about 40 seconds so you find this guy and he's locked himself in a cage and his parents are outside and you come up and you're like talking and he's like please I have a terrible rage and you have to get my sword and my shield back for my parents to defend them so that's against my rage and they're like no please don't go get his sword and shield please don't and you you ignore them and you go get his sword from the blacksmith and you get the sword from the blacksmith by sleeping with him by the way I fuck like six different people in this game so far like two two dudes and four women one thing I've learned about these games that now promise you know you can be as gay as you want straight as you want whatever basically it just allows you to be a more widespread creep who hits on people in inappropriate ways like oh your dad sick and people you've just found out they're trying to kill you I'm gonna fuck yeah that's a fair criticism of the first one of the girl in the in the second area because that was really weird the way Cassandra keeps not like nagging that girl and this isn't just a criticism of Assassin's Creed Odyssey it's like the triple A idea of romance in games just means like being a relentless creeper you're right but also as as as one of them one of them one of them gay people I do sometimes just like the escape is fantasy like I can just go fuck everyone oh no no I mean you know I'm I'm fairly open about my rampant on this sexuality I it's and I will obviously I'll take those options yeah but I just I find it funny just how bad it is when you like chip away everything and just be like oh this person is just too horny anyway yes you fucked the blacksmith yeah of course you do to get the sword because I knew help him with his erectile dysfunction and it's all good and he's delighted and he's wonderful these happy out and then you go off to get the shields which was stolen by a bandus and you kill the bandus take the shield back and you come back with the sword and the shield all happy and the parents are like oh no what have you done and basically it turns out that the guy in the cage is adopted and the blacksmith is his father and the bandit was his mother taking back his inheritance and so he runs out of the cage screaming I can't believe it you fuck my father and kill my mother I didn't realize we were back in Italy and see I was returned there's some really weirdly Italian accents in this game actually I think they actually had a lot of like authentic Greek uh voice performers in this one if I recall correctly yeah it was a big thing that they were like we want to hire Greek people first and foremost like I'll hand I'll hand it to Ubisoft that is one thing they do very well is um actually getting like real diverse uh employees and then people working on these games to make them authentic I'll give them credit there yeah I really like Cassandra's voice actor I think she's a really good job yeah yeah not not crazy about Alexios I feel like he's a little too but you know little too mr. Bean when you pick one character the other character when they show up in the game is a very different character than when they're the protagonist I don't want to spoil too much but uh right it's it's basically like oh this is the path my life would have taken if I hadn't been chosen protagonist yeah pretty much I would love her mr. Bean Assassin's Creed by the way Assassin's Creed mr. Bean just like climbing up pyramid with a turkey on your head because his Christmas and he's messed it up again I would play Assassin's Bean Assassin's Bean Assassin's Bean Assassin's Bean you know the way there's some moments where you realize just how massive a game is yeah I know I'd been sailing around some of the islands which by the way are fucking gorgeous someone who's beautiful like environments I've ever seen I always come to that point in an Assassin's Creed game like when I realize it's that massive it's when I've scrolled back on the map and then thought oh fucking hell yeah well then you're gonna you're gonna get no you're not gonna like this one then I keep your shit about red dead twos map size and it's like oh yeah no it's got like apparently I'm sure I heard that it's got the entirety of the first games map plus another map of that size oh I'm just like there's too much video game I don't have this much time in me like oh fucking hell I barely got an hour to watch the new doctor who fucking hell but I've been sailing around the islands for a while and just like this game is so huge how can it possibly be bigger and then they're like right it's time to go to Athens and I wrote up the the hill on my horse turned a corner and was fucking god I've never like Athens is amazing it and I didn't reach it to like 25 hours in or something and it's giant it's bigger than like Nova grad it's fucking huge and there's so much to do with it and it's just I don't know this is my kind of game it's I yeah I totally understand people's criticisms of it and I respect that but I fucking been loving it there are times where if I'd picked this game up at the wrong time in my gaming schedule yeah I would have given up on it and been like I'm not into this yeah the fact that there's nothing else out this month yeah I I locked into playing it when it was the only big release that I wanted to sink time into and I had yeah basically the quiet before the storm before I've got to do a bunch more work and I was like well I can actually take a quiet week for a bit yeah yeah I can take my time with this it's certainly not a game for people who um have no patience damn millennials it's not a game necessarily for people like me because normally in a game like this I would just be trying to go let's power through it so I can see the ending and go yeah that's a game ticked off my list I can talk about it and move on hmm any other time I'd have been I'd have been annoyed by my inability to power through this I keep meaning to go back to the main story but I keep accidentally finding fun things I want to do instead which I think is a good sign you know yeah right right right okay right now now I'm gonna say what I think of it now yeah go on go on do you think Jim right right I'm disgusted in it disgusted with it as a game as a mechanical game it's fine it is assassin's creed they do get a bit better every year in my estimation still not enough to fully grab me I will play them it'll be like watching um a bit like watching a fucking WWE paper view I'm like this is technically competent everything's working more or less I don't really get it uh but it is fine um first thing it did to me was advertise its helix points and a loading screen um immediately turn me off had a look at the store that just set the mood for the rest of the experience so much fun stuff sequestered off into that exclusive weapons in Toteinos pizza rolls in Walmart you gotta go to Walmart specifically and get 120 pizza roll pack for it regardless of whether you've bought one of the games set like six special editions I thought you know I don't mind the exclude like because there are hundreds of weapons in this game hundreds and hundreds and I just want like the XP boost I can I can I get the people are mad about that but the weapons it doesn't really bother me this year's gold edition was shitter than last year's gold edition I mean oh and I have to say something here I have to say something black flagged it all of this fucking bullshit and I didn't see anyone bitching about that game that's because after Assassin's Creed 2 I hated the series so much and was so sick of it I skipped three and black flag I'm not no but Jim I'm not I'm not talking about you I'm talking about the geno because I've been seeing so much bitching about this which is fair but at the time when black flag came out I was like why is no one mentioning the fact that like the upgrading your ship is absolutely painful unless you buy it oh I'd have made sure it was a conversation I'd have fucking made if I'd have bothered playing it at the time I'd have fucking made sure it was part of the conversation don't know bother mate um literally it rested entirely on my shoulders and I'll take that Burton and the credit for making anything happen in the games industry ever because I'm just that influential and brilliant that's why I get millions of views on each show I do in it um that's the only reason it's because now I now I'm fucking taking notice and it wasn't Polygon said it first they definitely didn't I'll revise that history um I didn't like it as far as grind goes some people said it doesn't bother them okay it bothered me uh it felt like RPG elements how far did you play by the way I played basically when did I get it like eight in the morning and then I finished at god like eight at night like about 12 hours or so um fair old time and and by the time I was done I was not firsting for more I was kind of happy that I'd got on the footage I'd gotten and was like I've got no desire to play this anymore it's fine and I don't have time for another fine sprawl of a game that feels like it's just out of control in terms of content and then I finished uh Yakuza Kawami which had been on my to-do list for ages just wrap up the last couple chapters there immediately downloaded Yakuza to Kawami and that is my week now and that will be my month until you know the flood of games start happening again way smaller in terms of square footage than Assassin's Creed Odyssey or any major AAA open world game but still feels like a way bigger world to me because I I care about it more and again people care about the Assassin's Creed world that's fine not judging them um you so are it no different strokes etc uh I try never to judge people for liking games they like if anything I generally generally feel envy for them uh because I would love to love every single game that people love um but when it comes to an open world game Yakuza as a series that's my ideal it's not fucking massive but and the things that are really I'm happy to do again and again because they're so fucking good did you get to the Dynasty Warriors part Jim yeah yeah I got to the war stuff um you know what if they made a full-on um Dynasty Warriors game I would not be against that I would play like Assassin's Warriors or whatever they'd want to call it um I'd play that with that gameplay as well I think I could be into that more than the actual Assassin's Creed mainline stuff I would play Dynasty Creed yeah like like however they want to do it um yeah that was all right the guys are a little ganky fucking that was shield bastards um but otherwise yeah that was okay but yeah you know I've been playing Yakuza to Kawami all week um I got my fill of Assassin's Creed Odyssey but it turns out I can't have enough Yakuza Fist of the North Star was fantastic Yakuza zero I loved Yakuza Kawami I loved Yakuza to Kawami I think I think that's the first or of second after six I forget which order they came out it's got a new engine and it looks amazing obviously not on a big sort of square annex Assassin's Creed level you know Ubisoft level uh but it's stylish it's stylishly gorgeous yeah but then great and and just the the way Camarocho and so can be um so can burrow I forget what the name of the second city sorry about that but just those bright right lights red light district flavor and the reflections of all those lovely bright lights on the puddles on the floor it just gives it this real flavor to it definitely Yakuza zero was well maybe not technically uh like the most best look great looking game but the design and it was so beautiful that it didn't matter yeah yeah and Yakuza to Kawami is like even better than that um the frame made took a hit for it which is never great um but the things it does in that one like little quality of life things like you know you don't have to have a loading screen when going in almost any building you just push the door open and any walks into the smile burger or you know the nightclub and it makes me more willing than even before where I was perfectly willing but I'm even more willing now to go into any building and explore it uh because it is it just feels so much more open and and there's no delay there and the combat system was overhauled in it and I'm like some of the stuff in there makes me want to weigh not more if it was carried over to Fister the North Star because it's fucking great the combat systems are amazing in the second uh Yakuza Kawami too uh specifically um the heat actions are a little harder to contextualize but make more sense and the heat bar doesn't drain as fast because in some of these games it feels like no matter how much you level up the heat bar one move will drain so much of it whereas this it's like you can pop up a couple a couple of special moves um in succession uh I I I love it I love it I forgot to ask are you excited about uh what's it called project judge which is that new thing that the uh the that that team are making yeah I mean I try not to be hyped for anything we talked about that one recently I wonder if we start on the week that you were missing Laura possibly I can't remember we definitely talked about it recently in any case this is one of those for you teams where I feel they can't do much wrong they've been so consistent and sort of like you'll be excited no matter what they're making sort of team I mean yeah yeah like I'm always interested and Vista the North style proved that that formula they have for Yakuza has so many legs um and it's not gotten like I'm not telltale with it yeah I'm not bored of the formula obviously I realize I'm a bit behind the curve as I'm only discovering a lot of these games net like more read in more recent years I think a lot of people are only discovering them now though yeah I mean it seems these re-releases have done really good for them and I'm glad because my god this is what I think of when I want an open world game like I'm impressed by the big hundreds of thousands of miles of square foot and all that stuff um miles of square foot that's not a fucking measurement um I'm impressed by that and it couldn't be good sure but give me a smaller open world with a lot more of a dense population and these naturally occurring substores that are just wild and hilarious there's a whole um sub quest in Yakuza 2 about man babies and man babies that try and force their man-babyness onto others and then it ends in a nice little parable about Twitter honestly I wish I'd gotten the screenshot because there's one line that is like you know just because you like something you don't have to force others to like it and I'm like my god this is a social media post it's a great oh like these has flaws there's some cultural stuff that you know you look at and and some TNA stuff we're like oh this is awkward there's a live action video where you play as the uh kick uh Kiri was a camera person um while a lady in it like progressively less clothing uh is there as a live action model and it's just socially awkward and I'm like oh this this makes me cringe but for the most part it's just such a bizarre fucking series in the all the right ways and yet when it takes itself seriously it doesn't feel like mood-witplash you're just I'm engrossed in this I think a lot of the sillier stuff makes you care about the characters even more like Kiryu is a fairly typical protagonist and that he's not busting with uh personality he's very stoic very badass but then these little substories his willingness to go along with some of the most nonsensical shit just makes you love him that bit more and it's for me your cooser is becoming ever more an example of what I feel more games should take examples of in terms of what content are we giving players what are we monetizing what are we giving people for their money without pushing the boat out to the point where it's unsustainable because they're not the most technically proficient games they're not the biggest games and it on a scale level and yet they feel so densely packed and so quote unquote big in what they do um um endlessly impressed with them so far and whatever they do in future for all the the downfall saker of his hat and the ups and downs over the years that shit is on point that shit knows what it's doing and what it's doing is very good i'm really glad you're enjoying it that much yay in conclusion for my school project i want to quickly talk about something before we finish yeah what do you think uh uh did either of you watch any of all of that loads of fallout 76 footage that came out not yet uh i lost a little bit i i know enough to like i picked up on some of the news that came out that like you're gonna be punished for just like murdering a player that doesn't want to take part in pvp and stuff like that yeah see that's my that's where i think godloff but they're being so naive yeah right now this is how griefing in the game works and i saw a video of a guy being griefed by another player and it was just oh god so basically how griefing works is if someone shoots you or attacks you it takes off a teeny teeny tiny minuscule amount of help like they would have to shoot you like 300 times to kill you which basically involve in this video a guy standing there following this guy around hitting him hundreds and hundreds of times not leaving him alone and if you want to like stop this you have to fast travel away so if you're trying to explore an area yeah there's someone griefing you and but you're shown on the map at all times to every other player so he can just find where you are and follow you and keep smacking you with this golf club over and over until you fight back at which point if he's a higher level troll he's just gonna murder you now he will then get a wanted level every player will see him on the map he'll get killed and lose 50 caps you lose 50 caps however i don't think that that's not understand that griefers don't give a shit about losing 50 caps yeah yeah yeah the only reason they play the game is to piss other people off the griefing is its own reward the only thing that pisses off a griefer is when they can't piss other people off that's not a punishment losing 50 caps they'll just not give a shit they'll run around with no caps i like the games that are like if you're gonna do all that shit you'll get put onto a server with all the other people who are doing all that shit yeah that's the best method just give them their own little help just have a dedicated pvp area yeah i don't understand why this is not the way they're doing it because this because listen i saw so much that look great in this these videos too like the world looks beautiful that there are actually quests um there there are no proper NPCs but the quests that i saw actually looked surprisingly interesting they they look like there was stuff to do which was my biggest fear about that game yeah but also they really don't understand what happens when they let people interact with each other yeah like this this video i saw the guy was trying to what the the and this was like wild Bethesda employees were watching they because they some higher level Bethesda employees set off the nuke for them just so they could see it and this guy was trying to watch the nuke and from the side of his screen all you you just kept seeing blood his blood flying off because this fucking absolute moron just was like kept hitting him you know and it was just what why why would they allow this in the game it's one of these things that's nice in theory in theory or world where you can do anything and there's risk of being attacked by some people who are also players in theory that's great but in practice it's annoying it sucks it's GTA 5's open world is fucking awful in multiplayer and that's that's what it's gonna end up like yeah yeah yeah it's it's it's a it gets annoying it's it's a great idea on paper no at least in GTA it takes a couple of shots for them to kill you and then you spawn somewhere else but in this it's gonna they're gonna be able to keep smacking you for like ages you know yeah i don't know i don't know Bethesda what do you do and i love you i'll reiterate what i've said for the whole thing in the i i don't know what to think of any of this until i actually try the full thing and that's why i've not been paying too much attention because then i'm gonna get it to cover it for working all that yeah so i'm just like i can't form an opinion on this shit till i play it just because it's kind of unsharted for them i feel like if if it stays at it's as it is the only way i'm gonna be able to enjoy this game is to join private servers with like big groups of people yeah where there's rules and you get kicked the fuck out if you act like a dickhead yeah well i mean i think we've seen from val's storefront and youtube that the whole no rules just write approach the whole hands off none to do with us approach and great in theory it's fine in practice it's a fucking annoyance yeah and they have said repeatedly if it's not if it's not working out after release they will you know it's not a pitines precise words where there's no finished version of this game it's going to be constantly changing it's it's one of these live services that the game industry loves now if if it if it is how it it was in that video then it's gonna be a fucking living nightmare it's gonna be not fun at all because you you'll just have griefers i got this feeling it's gonna be like a lot of games where the launch is not gonna be a fantastic experience and then like a year from now there'll be like comments from loads of people who will be saying oh it's much better now it'll be like four on a or one of those games where it's like oh well it's much better now a year from now the griefing will be gone and there'll be a town full of NPCs request like guarantee you yeah we'll see how it goes it's gonna be an interesting one just to see the evolution of of this um but yeah i'm i'm i don't know what to make of it until i actually get my hands on it which won't be too long from now yeah it is deceptively close isn't it so yeah when is it to november uh i think so yeah i think it's like a month or so away god between assassin's creed Odyssey that and red dead redemption too oh boy welcome to the world of live services you know people are gonna have to pick and choose which game they want to be their day job yeah that's that i love you and i really hope you work this one out because i fucking love fall out and i don't i don't want to be grieved fingers crossed for you gav yeah well there's a good place just to do the wrapping up isn't it let's brought us up to wrap up very nicely uh Laura uh tell people about things that you do things what i do

uh like a question and answer podcast it'll be hosted on patreon as i don't get off content people will be able to listen to it on patreon but uh to actually get questions on it you'll i'll be doing a comment thread on patreon itself so you need to be a patron to do that bit so the content's not gated off but you feel bad not giving patreon something extra so they get that little bit of extra interactivity with the content that anyone could listen to so that'll be on the patreon i'll uh once i get the first podcast up i'll obviously put it on social media and all that business so that's that thank you all as always uh we will see you next time uh goodbye bye",

The Yamavar Resort in Casino at Sandman Well on myself have partnered to give away a brand new Lexus GX 550 every Thursday in November. Club SRAM members can play all month long for a chance to win and go off-roading in this powerful and stunning SUV. And the cool part is, just hose it off afterwards, your mom will never know you took it in the dirt. Guys, you win? Yeah, me too. Okay. Detail the Yamavar.com must be touring when to enter. Please gamble responsibly. Thank you. I gave it to my mum. When I would send deep things I used to say I used to put little- Get rid of our marks, would you? Mugs. I can see our faces. I would put like a little emoji on the bell end. I just felt like it took the edge off like a little clock on the knob or whatever. It depends if it's a listed or unsolicited. I'd never send them unsolicited. So someone's asked for a dick pick and you put a little- To take the edge off. To take the toe to more clock. But they're asking to see the whole hog brother. Yeah, but I was just a bit insecure about it because- You get Russian salad off. Well, we're talking about this place. When I send a picture with dick pick, I just put a Russian salad on the end of it. And go, that's what mine smells like. My dick smells like Russian salad. So welcome back. Cole open, I reckon. Welcome back to Finland of our history. My dick smells like Russian salads. This is part two of our biggest series yet. Epic. On the Russian revolution, the long road to Gary Stevenson, the worst guy you know, at a house party at 4 a.m. telling you about how to fix the world. Now our last episode was a big sweeping pile of context. This episode, we are digging into the life and times of one of history's great characters. Ras Klaad, the Jamaica Russian monk. Yeah. It's alternative universe Putin if you grew up in Kingston, Jamaica. Yeah. And he tries to seize St. Bart's. Ras Putin is one of- This is one of the fun ones. Yes. This is probably my favorite bit of the revolution. Quite a unique historic figure, really. Yeah. I don't really know any bloke like him. He's one of those people where it's like, you're a new kind of bloke. Yeah. I mean, I guess Russell Brande is the closest. Ras Klaad blam. Do you reckon he should go into? Russell. He should go into court with one of those hats with the dreadlocks attached and go. I know Russell Brande, we name him Ras Klaad blam. Fair enough. Well, fair enough. Fair enough. Well, if you let us know, we find the real Russell brand. But we haven't found him anywhere. So, all right. You're off. Sorry, Ras Klaad brand. The old playing the old Ras Klaad defense. Cleaning the Ras Klaad. We're not heard in all Ras Klaad brand. We name Ras Klaad brand. Mior Likis, a woman when she asks me to. Anyway, welcome back. This is part two. Now, Ras Putin, yeah. The closest we have really to him is sort of Russell Brande that he is this, you know, on the face of it. What is I mystic? What is I mystic? What is I mystic called sex craze? You know, for some men hating women want to fucking, like no one really has this kind of piercing eyes. This sort of, yeah, warped soul then women can't help but fall them fall over. Shape shifter. Shape shifter. Sort of quasi religious but not. Yes. You know, vaguely spiritual rapists. Allegedly? Yeah, I sort of believe in God of the stuff anyway. We want to share something. Yeah, yeah. I think I reckon God told me to feed you to take a pass off. Whatever you need. Whatever you need for me to fucking it. Whatever you need for me to fucking it. Whatever you need for me to fucking it. Whatever. Whatever. I'm into all that shit. Yeah. So Ras. Alijiz Bar. Sorry? Alijiz Bar. Alijiz Bar. Is that what you want? So Ras Putin, yeah. We left off with the Roman of family in about 1905. We just had a son and their son is a he before. Yeah. The son is attracted to 13, 14 year old girls, specifically even though he's 11 days old. And they think, fuck, this is terrible. How's he going to? Yeah. And it's also it's been a long road to get this son even when we touched on this briefly in the last episode. Four horrible daughters. They've had four every time they just keep trying to have a son. Yeah. She just keeps putting out daughter after. And there's no like this door. There's no scams where you find out the sex. There's no gender reveal parts. So it's just fucking disappointing. The gender reveal part. And it's more than that because it's the it's the air reveal party. It's whether you've got an air or not. Huge deal. Huge deal. It's like the new Pope. White smoke. Because yeah, if they don't get a son, the whole line could be devastated. Dracking mixed race couples would ever do like a race reveal party. You know when there was that big fuss. White or white smoke. Yeah, let the Pope. Or brown, black, brown or white smoke. Is that white always white smoke? It's always a white Pope. If they ever had an African Pope, they'd put black smoke out and I'm like, Whoa, it's a black Pope. It's a black Pope. Shit. Why are you a gay? He's Pope. Probably would be a bit like that. Pope, why are you gay the first? Yeah, a black Catholic Pope probably would be like, why are you gay? Yeah, it would be. I reckon that's the next because we had quite liberal Pope recently, haven't we? Yeah. The next stage is this is conservative black. Massive swing back to like hard conservative African Pope. Yeah, yeah. Happy grade. Literally the why are you gay Pope? It comes out to people's balcony. You are gay. You are transgender. Anyway. Russ Gladport. We're talking about the story of the daughter's. Yeah. So there's no gender reveal party and every, you know, Nicholas II is at the, the, in the lady end of, he's looking at his lady be destroyed by another terribly useless girl. I used the story to keep flying out of his, his lady's lady. Yeah. There's lady upon lady. It's all grim stuff. Yeah. And finally they have this son, this, this heir, but he's even weaker than Nicholas II. He's a cock inside a car. He's a cock inside a car. It's a Russian cock doll. What are those things called? Russian dolls, yeah. Yeah, but what's the name of the bush? The Bushka. Yeah. The Bushka dolls. Yeah. The cock, fuck. The cock, fuck. It's a cock within a cock and, uh, yeah, he, he, cut me any bleeds. It doesn't stop bleeding. Cut me any bleeds, cut me. You cut me and I bleeds, I die. That's the phrase, that's the same. Rather than cut me, I bleep Russia. Cut me and I bleep. Cut me and I bleep. I'm dead. I'm dead. I cut me and I'm dead. I'll die because I won't stop bleeding. I can't. There's no blood clad in a Lexi, uh, Romanov. So this is terrifying because they, they know they knew this was going to happen because Alex, um, Alexandra's the Hessian princess. The Hessian princess. She's got bad genes. Yeah. There's some hemophilia somewhere in the family. Yeah. But pretty much instantly they know fuck he's got this. Yeah. He's not going to live very long. So they start looking around for anyone to help. And she's, you know, she's had five kids. She's, uh, I don't know. She, she goes kind of full white woman. Would you argue, Alexandra? Yeah. You know, she, uh, is paranoid back to the corner. So her personality sort of becomes crystals. Yeah. She, yeah, she goes full, full wacky. You know, I don't know if you ever walked down Columbia Road, flower market. I just a little Columbia Road. Well, nearly all the shops there, all four seem to be owned by, uh, women of wives of rich men. Yeah. Who need a hobby? They all seem to sell the same things in different orders. Yeah. Yeah. And it just feels like it's mad. You can do what you want. Just leave me alone. Yeah. They're all fronts or women to fill the space in between Chalka. And Alexandra, she nags Nicholas a lot and he's like, do whatever you want. And she's like, well, I've got into mystical stuff, the occult stuff. Yeah. But we should stress that around this time, the Russian elite were really into some messed up shit. Right. Like there's a huge, uh, it's hard to talk about with that. Because in my head, I'm just imagining, like footage of sayances, possibly doing sayances. Without them Curtis talking over the top of the, yeah. Because that, that's kind of to me, you know, I'm beginning of the protest. Yeah. And they were, the true ghost was the specter of the Russian people. And many ways they were rehearsing that own annihilation. They'd lost the world of collapse. Nothing comes strange. Yeah. They'd become weird. Yeah. They were, they were talking about dead people are, they had lost any sense of themselves. They no longer believed in the role of the role of the role of the role. So you've got a, this weird thing at the start of the 20th century in Russia where the elite start going for sayances. They start doing weegee boards. They're obsessed with the occult. I mean, there's a large, we talked about Russian Orthodoxy. There's a large mysticism in it as compared to the very straight down the line. Yes. No, that, please. Yeah. It's wild, the asiatic. I work hard and then I die and I go to a slightly nicer room. Yes. That's life and death. Russians are like suffering, pecky being pegged up the ass gives me bliss. And then there's a kind of mystical whack of due element to it as well. So there's lots of mad sects as well of Russian Orthodoxy which we'll get into. But there's also a do Russian monk who's never met a woman. So this seems to be one of these kind of like intense Orthodox monks. Yeah. I think we know as well because we can't understand what kind of Catholic sects look like. Yeah. Right. The Russian monk who said to have never met a woman is Milhael Tolostos who lived for 82 years within the strict confines of Mount Athos, a Greek monastery but still Orthodox. Well, women are forbidden. Tolostos raised my monks after being orphaned and never saw a woman during his lifetime. Christ the dream. The luckiest man I've ever lived. Wow. That is the ultimate in sell. Well, that's a man. That's a man at peace who's never been that, doesn't it? That's a man who's never been asked to change a hoover bag. Never been asked for directions. He's able to watch films entirely in peace. He's never been asked, who's that? Is that bad guy? What's happened to him? Yeah. My God. What a hero. Go on. Are the people who don't rank or have sex today? No fat. Yeah, no fat. Are they leaking? Do they just explode and leak all the time? I think probably. Yeah. I think they're not all the time but the wet dreams would be insane. You know how you talked about your mom? Was it your mom who's been us? Yeah. And the worst thing was about a fight. A fight for vomiting or a big talk. He's a guy pulling out their mouths. Yeah. Are you saying that a guy who doesn't rank can just come just comes out of his mouth? He gets rushed into A&E. And then just. I'm just. Quint. Someone ranked this guy off. He's going to. Just drowning in your own come like Hendrix. Yeah. Drowning in vomit. There's a guy just who hasn't ranked for 80 years. He's just. Drowning in come coming out of his. Is that how this guy dies? Yeah. The wet dreams. No more. But then he doesn't really know what woman even looks like. So I don't know where this horniness is sort of like. But we don't know his horny. He's in this company. He's definitely on it. What do you mean he's definitely on it? He's never met a woman. Yeah, but he doesn't have to be. He could just look at a nice. You know, you could have been. He could have been going. Exactly. Also drippiest robes as far as Christian sex go. So when he has a way to when he has a wet dream does he not know what's making him come? Yeah. Like what's he dreaming of just like God? God. The sky. That's crazy. But do you think there are any monks who kind of you know they they hold it down for 50 years, but then they break and then they have to stay white and then they go on. Yeah, famous. Yeah. Yeah. That's famous. Do you think there's any monks? Yeah, I reckon there's a couple. Yeah. I reckon there's articles on a few. I mean, the art documentary. The art documentary has just had to resign because of all the all the stuff. But fucking a monk would be quite there's something quite sexy about that, I think. Right. What the what's laughing their balls heard. You just finally get them grabbing onto the hair bit. What you mean like it's a handle. Spit on the ball patch. In the same way that like men want to take girls virginities, you want to take a month. Yeah. So the monk would be like we shouldn't really it's so sinful. Yeah. And like that feeling of you want to be the boy that corrupts the month. But you're fair. Fucking a monk from behind hold it. The ridge is like a pasty ridge that you can hold. Do you know what I mean? I just hold in that little fuck hand or. Like that would be great. With his hair. Yeah, I was holding it up. Like holding that bit up. Yeah. Or you just make it a bump like that. Yeah. And you want to spit on his ball patch. There'd be so ashamed afterwards as well. There'd be so ashamed. Yeah, because you'd ruin their life. Yeah. You'd collapse their life. Well, you're kind of saying when you rape a monk that they feel ashamed afterwards. I don't know if that's. They don't rape the need. They want it. But then afterwards they say now you sound like Russell Brand. No, they want it. Right. Anyway. So there's a huge turn at the start of the 20th century towards mysticism. And so my point is is that Alexandra looking for mystics. It's not in a vacuum. This is kind of part of the Russian elite. And there is a man born. He's born out in the wilds in Siberia. Oh, got the rosky Siberia. What kind of old school? Deep Siberia. Now, what do you know what Siberia is? What do you think Siberia is, Charlie? Mountains. No, but what do you think it is as an entity? Just like a kind of county. Yeah, that's what I mean. I think I, because I thought Siberia was a region, but it's kind of basically like the Wild West. Yeah. Because the Wild West is... Worcester, you're saying, oh, equivalent. If you're naughty, you get sent to Worcester. Yeah. I think Worcester is lovely. No, it's Siberia. I don't think so. I think Siberia is like Lincolnshire. My point is Siberia is not a county. It's two thirds of Russia. Right? In the same way the Wild West is everything west of the Mississippi. Yeah. It's more of like an expanse. So Siberia, I think, is east of the Urals. Right? So it's just everything, all of Wild Russia is Siberia. It's not a place. Yeah, this is... It's more of a concept, right? A city stop. Yes. Yeah. So it's most of Russia's Siberia. Yeah. It's not like this one region. So Rasputin is born in Siberia, illiterate peasant. And quite early on people start to... I think his mum, and this is classic Russian stuff. Right. My mum's love suffering. His mum has seven children. Right. All of them die in infancy or in childbirth. Rasputin is the first one to not. Right. And she's obviously like, oh fuck, he's lived. I was loving it when all my kids were dying. I never felt more alive than when every kid I had, seven out of seven were dead. And now I've been cursed with the son who's lived past three. Christ. Well, he's going to have a terrible time. I might as well kill myself to feel anything. They love suffering. And so Rasputin is the first one who lives. And so people, quite early on in his village. I like this guy is the problem. Who's this guy? Who's this? He's five. What devil in Karnat is this? He's a literate, obviously, everyone's there. In this village, there's only a tavern on a church. That's the only thing. And the rest is just 15-hut. He gets suspected early on of being a horse thief. He loves naked horses. He's sort of also, he communes with horses, I think. He's got early brushes with religious visions, which is kind of, he's a con man sort of, he's Rasputin, you're right. Yeah, he is. I mean, he's Rasputin. But he is. He's around recently, it's amazing. His Griff is just getting, he is an artist. He's a rascal. He's recently been on his rumble thing. And after all this shit, he said, he's now did a two-minute spoken ad for coffee, anti-aging coffee. Right. That's called 1776. So it's like alpha independent conservative anti-aging coffee. Right. And so, what could do biohacking that's also built into conservative Republican declaration of independence and he's shifting that. That's fucking mad. Along with his amulets that protect you from airport wife, so you've got conservative biohacking. Yeah, because I guess like oil of Ola is quite wet, isn't it? Yeah. And like anti-aging cream. But that's normally seen as hippie. That's what I mean. And now it's called 1776. Man, anti-aging, it's fucking bonkers. He's also calling anti-aging cream after a year that's very old. Coffee, it's coffee. It's coffee, but it's in, which is even weirder. Yeah, I don't understand this at all. Yeah, look like you're from 1776. You look fucked. Drink this, you look fucking old. Bazaar. Anyway, so he, Rasputin Marries 19, becomes a dad. That's not the defining point of his life. He starts to get the sense that maybe he doesn't want to be a stay-at-home dad. He starts to become a graterous kid. So he says, oh, God's quite convenient. I'm going to become religious. And he starts becoming this sort of wandering religious figure called a tranic pilgrim. Or you sort of wander around. Greetings from my bath, festive friends.

It's called the Clist or the Clisty. And what these guys do is they have these mad rituals. Now like what we were chatting about in the last episode about Russian Orthodox mysticism, suffering. These fuckers, right? It's speaking in tongues. So they all, so they all of them, they're getting a big circle and they wrap start a rope around their neck. And it goes around everyone's neck. And they basically all like chant and throttle each other. And they're like, and they try and get high off the asphyxiation. And then they, this is all like, they're like, so group strangle wings. Group strangle wings. Right? Like a chain gang strangle wing. And they go and then they all collapse when just before they all die. And they immediately all fuck each other. They just start fucking the person next to them. And it's like the suffering, the near death, the pain. There's also not a lot to do inside. Yeah, I mean, there's no team. Yeah, it's fucking boring. So you're inventing some mad stuff out there. Because there is nothing to do. This is a real, this is a real argument for TikTok and all this brain. Yeah, back in the day before phones, we'd go out, we'd make our own fun. We would be out of the forest. We would shankle wanking and chain gang strangle wings. We'll think chain white gang chain gang gang gang. It's all in there somewhere. But they'd all pass out and just fuck each other in the snow with relief. Yeah, that they lived even though they was like, we need to kill ourselves because you're an idiot. So they also do self-flagging. I mean, hard comes though. Oh, one of the hardest cars. Yeah. I mean, we've never lost the ceremony level comes. I'm not coming this hard. No, no, no, no, even there. I'm sort of coughing sort of humiliating. I'm coming so weekly that immediately. I'm like, I'm straight back to work. Right, back to work. Right. Anyway. Anyway, that was basically a sneeze. Yeah, exactly. I'm coming like a sneeze. These guys are coming like projectile vomiting. Oh, the mouth. Like like the doctor who regenerating. That's how they come in. They become a different person. They come so hard. Superman. Yeah. They're turning to David Tennant. They're coming so hard. But they also they self-flagulate, which is whipping each. Yeah. They're coming. Oh, yeah. Yeah. So Charlie's got up the raiders of the lost arc scene. This is how they're coming. Yeah. Yeah. They explode. Yeah. That's how they're coming. It's some pretty hard comes. To be fair, if I was in deep Siberia with a load of peasants and serves, I bet I could convince them quite a lot of stuff. Yeah. Do you know what I mean? Hey guys, I found a really long right. I've got an idea. Why don't we all tie this around each other's neck and fuck each other? All right. Yeah. Oh, sounds good. What else you do today? I don't know. Looking for bread. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, there's fuck all I do. So, going else on? No. Are you going to do the, um, are you going to the fuck, uh, chain game? The chain game. No, instead I'm going to sit at home and look at a wall. Yeah. I don't really know. It sounds like I'm going to shiver in this heart of my own. It sounds like a good place to stay warm if nothing else. It's fucking freezing out here. Um, so he's a, he's a clisty. So he's into some mad stuff, right? Yeah. So Rasputin meets this guy while he's wandering around called Makari. Look at his fire. Look at these guys. So Rasputin's on the right. Um, Makari is basically a, like Rasputin is not really a priest in the proper sense. No. He's obviously attracted to it because he's, he's like, I'm spiritual. Yeah. He's one of those guys. Yeah. He's vaguely spiritual. He's just sex addicts. Yeah. He's, he's, he's a, which as, yeah, uh, which I used to say, it's like about Russell Brandt. He's a sex addict. He's really mean to that. He's a rapist, but he's got a podcast. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Um, so he's a sex addict and Makari, what Makari does is he sits him down and he goes, no, listen, the thing about being religious spiritual is that you can only be holy if you, if you sin. Yes. Like you only get, get to be an example of holiness. If you live a life of sin as well. And so here starts this kind of mad duality, which is particularly Russian Orthodox, I think, where you are, you have to travel in the world of sin to know anything about what sin is. Yes. If you're not sinned, you do not know what sin is. How can you reach about sin? Which is Russell Brandt's entire defense. Yeah. Like he comes out and he says, no, I, I, I have sinned. I'm a dirty filthy sinner. I was never a rapist, but I've sinned. Of course I have. You know, that, that, you know, I had sex with him. He didn't want to. Yeah. I'm a sinner. Of course. I'm not a rapist. Um, but that's his hot. He's, you know, to be fair to Russell Brandt, I don't know anyone who's defended themselves in court by building a world. Yeah. Like he's built this whole other universe, because his new reality, yeah. That is going to be, well, it's quite interesting to see where the legal system can punch through that. Um, I mean, it probably can. Yeah. That's why it's there. But, but, um, so Maccarrie convinces Rasputin that, yeah, you can be a priest because pre, you, you can still fucking bang rocks, man. You can still do it. Cause then, you know, you can tell people to not do that. And you can keep doing it because you keep having to realize how bad it is. But then if someone was kept on fucking and sucking and kept being like, no, you wouldn't like this. That, that's, that's, that's like a guy with an orgy. Strangling himself. This is terrible. It's really bad. Yeah. I just experimented this to sit to make sure it's not. Yeah. Yeah. It's basically like, you know, just saying, you know, let me just taste it. That's any good. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And even your whole pudding, then you don't want that. You don't want it. You don't want it. So, um, yeah, check it for poison. Yeah. Instead it's a good time. Yeah. It's brilliant. You'd hate this. No, it's not for you. So then when he realizes Maccarrie kind of unlocks that in his head and he realizes he can still be a naughty fuck, not a naughty fuck boy. And be convincing me a priest. So he starts to enter the Zars Court in the early 20th century. So he arrives in St. Petersburg in 1903, starts to gain traction with the clergy and then aristocracy that are looking for wild sex freaks. Yeah. Because they're, but it's often, you know, it spices things up. Things get stale. You want something. Yeah. It's the decadence at the end of 300 years of Roman off rule. Right. So he meets these Montenegrin princesses called the black crows. They were white. They just had big noses. Right. Um, beaks. They're big old, big old hooters. And one of them knows there's our arena. Anyway. Yes. Uh, he gets. And he's got a real attraction to power. Yeah. Like ambitions. Yeah. And he has a real influence over people. He has a true charisma. Deep piercing eyes. And what doesn't come in the photos every photo he looks terrifyingly intense. He gets more photos up of him. He looks literally like a devil, but something to know about him is he had a great time. He had a good laugh. He was funny. He was charming. He might look intense in photos. That's just his, um, that's just his photo face. Well, yeah. Apparently he was actually very funny. And like, um, social response. But he never, you never saw this in his photos. Yeah. I guess it's only photography. Isn't it? We have everyone look boring and that's quite fun. One there. He's doing that. But he had put a pipe. Now he had this awful, horrible, lanky beard. He'd eat with his hands. Huge man. Big guy. He'd eat with his hands. Um, he'd always have food in his beard. Right. Apparently he smelled like a goat. And apparently, apparently men always used to say like this guy fucking stinks. And women used to be like, I want to fuck that guy. Real man. They could smell the smell of the man would drive them wild. Like he's giving off pheromones. Right. Only women are picking up. Men are being like that guy. Can you get that tramp out of it? And women are just like, oh yeah, women just want to suck and fuck him. Yeah. Because the horrible muskie amits just fucking. He's like an animal. Tends their ovaries on fire. Right. Right. Right. So women in the elite women, the court, they all, they're all loving him. And he introduced to Zahneclyst II and Alexander just after bloody Sunday, which is now what we ended with. Oh, bloody Sunday. Do you want to do you want to pick up where we left off with bloody Sunday? Yeah. Yes. So bloody Sunday, it was a massacre from a peaceful protest. And it kind of said was the myth that the of the Zahra is a little farther. Yeah. As the kind of like protector of the people. But he's not by far to anymore. Yes. Trigger's revolutions all over the country about bad conditions, because this revolution is going through the country. Naturally forms these kind of local councils of workers coming together and speaking and trying to have some sort of representation. And those are called in Russian Soviet means meeting. Yeah. And so the word Soviet comes from that. But as the union of meetings, that's it. Christ fucking boring country. The union of meetings. Yeah. That's what that country means. Yeah. The union of meetings of speaking together of bureaucracy of talking. Trotsky sets up the most important moments, the same Petersburg Soviet. But yes, basically, they repress. They send all of the communist leaders, early communist leaders who will get to they will get either ex-Arthas Siberia all have to escape to Europe. Right. There's a big crack down from the army. And it fails. Yeah. As a revolution. But he can see there's a small concession. Yeah. That he sets up the Duma Duma Duma Duma Duma Duma Duma Duma Duma Duma. Yeah. He sets up the Duma Duma. Everyone else will have their MPs up to have that haircut. And now a question from the MP for a little bit. He wants to undermine the authority of it. That's why he calls it a Duma. That's why he calls it the Duma. Yeah. The big stupid poopy head meeting. Yeah. You guys can have something. But it's a poopy head. What do you know? They think why not wear a cock on my head whenever I make a point? I feel this undermines me. That's the dumber. That's the rules. So bloody Sunday. The do mo and it basically means that you can table ideas that he can reject. Yes. So it's a very basic form. I think the first thing he sets it up. And everyone's like great. We've got representation as a people. The first thing he gets the Duma to decide on is they like a new washing machine. Basically whether an area of Siberia has been collected on a Tuesday or Wednesday. And they decide it's Wednesday and he goes, nah, fuck it Tuesday. Like he just does not give a shit. Takes the complete piss. Because Zardicklis II is a complete autocrat to the bones. As we said in the last episode, he's a little gay boy in hot pants with rollerblades and he sees that his granddad has his legs blown off. He hates the idea of any kind of revolution or anything that's not him as an absolute monarch. With that in mind, Rasputin arrives in this slightly surface reforming start in about 1905. And immediately, so while this is beginning on Zarina, Alexandra, she's had this French butcher's son. Well, I mean, Christ, the French butcher's my words. Everything's going on in there. Nose to tail. This butcher's boy has been helping her supposedly with her. He's been a mystic. Fine. He's weird thing about butcher's son as a mystic. Well, there's a lot of guts he can fuck, I guess. Is that one of mystic's? I don't know what for her probably. He's got access to a lot of waging hearts. So the boy is, you know, the young son is only about a year old and he has these kind of outbreaks of desperately wanting to fuck a 13-year-old. He's a terrible. He's got a shouldn. He's even filial. And so the butcher's boy died, I think, quite suddenly. And he, on his deathbed, predicts that a new mystic will arrive and fill his space. And then the black crows, the terribly ugly Montenegroons, they... Big nose bitches. The big nose pitches from Montenegro. They introduce Zarina to Rasputin. And the first, and Nicholas II, the first Nicholas II does go, this guy fucking smells like a goat. Can we get him out of here? And Alexander's like, I want to fuck. I never see him. I'm more shocked to that man. Do you want to see a lady? Do you want to meet a lady? Do you do it and just get the legs open? So immediately she's hooked on Rasputin. And Rasputin has this sort of calming quality on the Zarina. And so there's lots of... He's brilliant at manipulating people. He is. The boy would have these outbreaks of hebefilia. And... And there's only Rasputin that would be able to be like, hey, hey, wait for them to grow older. Wait for them to grow older. It gets better. Arguably they're not in their peak to the 1718. Cool it. Wait for the Milfire. Wait for the Milfire. Wait for the Milfire. He's a gilf man. Because the thing about Rasputin is he wanted to fuck anything. And he was. And he was. Skinny, big, no tits, big tits, no arse. He didn't care. He wanted it on him. He no one loved Muffin more than this guy. I mean, he's moved away from his family. He's got like two or three kids with something outside of the area. He's like, ah fuck, I'm going to some pizza burger. I'm going to fuck the queen. And do you know... He had the biggest hog. Right. I mean, saving the hog. No, no, we could... I mean, I was going to get to that. But by all accounts he had the biggest hog. And they put it in a jar. And I'd love to see his hog. You can literally see his cock pickled. Well, there's a funny story. There's actually... There's a rival hog that... So we'll get to his end. But at the end, supposedly they cut his dick off because he had this sort of massive hog. And they pickle it and they put it in a museum. But there's also a rival hog that's actually in... It's because it's pickled. It turns out to be a sea cucumber. So that's how big his dick is. Yeah. It could be mistaken for a sea cucumber. I don't know many people who has such a famous hog that it's pickled in a jar for everyone to see. They're not doing that for mine. For mine, they're flying it into... No man's land dropping it into the sea like in Lardin. It's done too much damage. Get rid of it. It can't become a memorial site. It can't be a martin dick. Look at that. That's a sea cucumber. That's the kind of girth. It's not going up at 90 degrees. That's terrifying. I guess if you had that sort of sea cucumber, you probably would want to fuck your way to say Pete'sburg. Yeah, why not? It basically fucked his way out the forest of Siberia. With a huge hog. Yeah. A sea hog. He's a bit of rough, I guess, in the high courts. Because these people have been with these kind of quite fruity, you know, limped-risted juke's with the tiny cocks. Yeah. And then his fucking forest goat man comes out of Siberia. It's a stinky goat boy with a huge hog. It's a high-lul-like, fucking horse. Yeah. He's just a bit of rough. You get a dick down by this. So apparently he'd have the smelly. He had this apartment where all these, there's a photo that we'll get up. We just had him surrounded by posh women. He's like, some Pete'sburg is a bit of rough, as you say. Yeah. So he would go into the room. He'd go into his bedroom and he'd say that I'm going to go commune with gods. Does anyone else want to come and speak to God with me? And these women would be like, yeah, yeah, I need salvation. And they'd just go and fuck him. Brilliant. And because they think he's the Messiah, they think he is Jesus reborn. Yeah. There's one woman that had, woman who had like a family with like three kids and she just left them to go and move in and live in his house. Yeah. Because she just wanted to be fucked by a stinky goat hog. I'm getting railed by this horribly smelly, rascal, rotten rascal, rotten. So, you know, he's becoming this catnip to a certain type of Russian woman. And also at the same time, you know, there's our Nicholas falls in love with him in his own way. Yeah. And less sudden than Zarina, but no, but he, you know, because I think what makes his wife happy. Yeah. And I think that's also like happy wife happy life. Yeah, that's why that's the that's the cock hole's motto. You know, you could be a bit concerned that your wife's getting railed by a massive guy with a lot of happy wife happy life. I like her. I'm just I'll be in the wardrobe. Yep. That looks nice. There's been lots of discussions about why he is able to sort of cure Alex. He's outbreaks of he, Pavilion. Does he? Well, yeah. So he there's a big moment. I don't know when it is, but oh, fuck. Now this is this is again, this is another reason why it's like a Russian novel this moment, right? So Rasputin is sort of commute spending time at Sam Petersburg, fucking everyone. Apparently he drinks like an absolute fish and he's getting his hog out in the middle of another. And he's shaking and going, oh, the sawarina loves this. Anyway, so he goes, he commutes back and forth to the side. He's doing a phone gag with his massive cog. He's going, oh, sorry, Nicole. Hello. And that's the biggest cock is that you can go up to there. Happy TV. Hello. This is a cute dog. When did making plans get this complicated?

And we go back to Siberia and he ends up getting stabbed by a woman with no nose. Get a photo of her up. She just prostitute who was given such a bad review that they cut her nose off. Right. Right. She looks pretty terrifying. Yeah. Fuck. So she goes back to Siberia and a woman with no nose stabs him. You'll fuck anything. Because you'll fuck anything. Because he's sort of becoming like, at this point I should say, the Russian public are aware of him and they're aware that, you know, he's holding all this influence over the court. And although the the the the doomer which sonnick less keeps shutting down. It's being shown as the mirage that it is and there's still no really reform reforms on people are still poor, hungry, thick, suffering. But they kind of like it. I mean, it's all the following is a fucking mess. Anyway, on the day. But it's seen as the excess as the court. Yeah, the excess of the court they've got this mad monkey there. Yeah. On the day that he gets stabbed repeatedly by a woman with no nose. It's the same day Franz Ferdinand is assassinated in Sarajevo, which will end up causing starting World War One. And is it the feeling that he's like a voodoo doll? Basically, yeah, it's a yeah. So I said while he's in Siberia recovering from being stabbed by the woman with no nose. How does she smell? Well, it's Christian. So it's probably to his pheromone. Probably to why she was stabbing him. Yes, of course. Because she was the only person who was immune to his gif. Yes, because she can't smell him. Yeah. She also probably in all seriousness, smell awful. If we could be serious for a second, I think that syphilitic prostitution in Siberia stunk like hell. Yeah. On a more serious note. She had a hole where her nose should be. So maybe she's smelled very well, actually. Maybe she got more. Maybe the nose gets in the way of smelling. Maybe she's got rid of it and had a hole. That's down in a chest down in a Westbrook who still hasn't knows, but she doesn't have any nostrils, Charlie. No. Thank you. So, you know, Rasputin gets rascal outputin gets shanked by Danilo Westbrook. Yep. While he is recovering in Siberia in a hospital, Alexi has a massive outbreak of fever failure. He's really awly. What's the fucking thing, Gerald? And the Saurina is going mad. It's a near death experience. The Saurina is going absolutely mad. And she calls for Rasputin. And Rasputin sends her a telegram saying calm down. It's not his time. Everything's going to be fine. Pussy glad. Everything's going to be airy. He says everything's going to be airy. Pussy glad. And this calms the Saurina. And everyone thinks that the reason he could actually help the boy is that the miracle drug at the time was aspirin. Right. But aspirin is the worst thing you can take from him. He's a blood thinner. So he says let the doctors leave him alone. Leave him be. Just calm down. He's going to be fine. So he thinks that maybe he's finding him with drugs that actually worse for him. Yeah. And actually that they think a large part of it was psychosomatic. And the fact that he calmed the mother meant the boy could stay calm. Right. And like apparently if you're bleeding a lot, if you calm down, have a cup of tea. You're fine. I don't know if I can know. I'm not a scientist. Anyway, Rasputin desperately doesn't think well, one should rush to draw a mobile one. And he warns against the Saur going to war. But there's a he thinks this is his moment. Yeah. And he thinks this is a great time. So he I think also he's like, is he a real game? Is he cousin? Is he willing the seconds? Cousins? Is he a little help? Yeah, but and also he looks identical to the British King as well. Well, they're related, aren't they? Yeah. Or they're with wife. So they're all related. They're all related. Yeah. Yeah. You know, the big incest gang bangs, you know, it's gone to. Well, the one to be honest is, I don't know if you have cousins who have family fights in the comments on Facebook. But I certainly do have a whole side of my family who they will just get into a huge public fight. Right. One will post a status about the other one being a snake. They'll just comment. Yeah. That's kind of what World of One was with the one with the Queen Victoria's grandchildren. It's probably like you're a fucking snake. Well, you know, you, you, you don't even know you're fucking born, you know, sort of stuff. So Russia joins World War One. And it starts going badly pretty quickly. And they lose like, I thought using millions of men. Well, they're not, which they, which German, they put on an army army in the world. Yeah. And Russia have modernized the bit, but not at all built. Yeah, they're ill equipped. They're not trained. They lost the Japanese for Christ's sake. So at some point, grass, Nicholas the second decided, I think in 1915, to take control of the armed forces himself. Yes. Because that's how much of a, well, I think it's a boost morale. So he gets the front line, but he's not charismatic and he's not built for that sort of stuff at all. He's boring. He's sad. He's weak. He just makes everyone leave more depressed. They go, I want we're fine for this come. Yeah. And he's got terrible military leadership. Yeah, he doesn't know anything. Yeah, a point. Terrible people. And also Russ Putin, even though he was against the war, he's so much in the ear of the Sarina and the Tsar that he's helping getting military appointments. Well, so this is where he really comes into. He comes back to some pieceburg and with, in the absence of Sarnik as the second, the Sarina basically starts running Russia. But she's, but she's, but she's sick of shit. She's sick of, yeah, shit and annoying and annoying and she's fucking a guy who smells. Yeah. And so the smelly, the smelly guy with a big hog and the thick ugly dumb bitch, a running Russia, right? I couldn't have put it back myself. There you go. Just smack that to the covers, get on with it. Right. Next ball. And so suddenly they have something like, they're constant, I don't know, I don't know how many. Let's say four prime ministers in a year, they're constantly firing, there's constant cabinet reshuffles. They're just appointing people that they think they like. They don't know anything. This is where the propaganda about Rasputin really starts going out of control. Yeah. Do I touch on his drug taking as well? Oh, yeah, he's giving the king the king. The Nicholas. I've given the king a lot of their opiums and that cocaine. He's giving him gear. Right. He likes him because I like cool guy. Yeah, he's like cool guy. Telegram the guy. Where's the smelly guy? Yeah. I want to smell that smelly guy stuff. So he's giving him gear. He's probably boning his wife. Yeah. Benital's love is actually his car. Yeah. You know, a lot of sick guys in the court at the moment. Yeah. And then he's, Rasputin's like, hey, you got any long ropes in this house? You're seeing something fun. You want a really good time. You want a really good time. That's all get, let's get all your mates together. So there's a big belief from Russian public that he's a German spy because things are going so terribly. Right. The war's going back. The war's very unpopular instantly because they have even less bread. And they didn't have much bread to begin with. No, but they're obsessed with bread these people. They're always going about bread. Yeah, expand your diet. I guess it's the only thing that's not cabbage or beetroot. I mean, it's really grim. So the faith in the monarchy, which is already bad, pretty much the bottom falls out of it. Rasputin tries to fuck that out. Obviously. So this is where it gets really, really juicy. Right. But in 1916, there's a lot of elite, a lot of other people in the Russian aristocracy that think Rasputin is the problem. And we need to get rid of him in order to save the czar. I mean, they're partially right. They're partially right. The problem is Nicholas really in the whole institution. Yeah. But anyway, so as a guy called Prince Yusupov, who's the czarine has nephew. So he's related to Queen Victoria as well. He has been to Oxford, been to the Bullington Club. He starts a plot to kill Rasputin. Right. And the way he does this, the way he tricks Rasputin into meeting him is he says, I'm bisexual. I think he is bisexual. Right. And his wife's a bit of a gore as well. And I want you to tell me time. I'll be there. I want you to come to my wife and I want to see other geogas. Brilliant. Midnight, Minna. All right. Yeah. Fine. So Rasputin goes to his house. And what he does is he. He makes it look like a big party scene downstairs in the basement. This is like he's stressing us out for a party. Yeah. Yeah. Almost like a immersive theatre, right? Yeah. He goes in and check all the walls. It's a punch truck. Yeah. So he lays out these cakes that are laced with cyanide. And then Madera Wine, that's laced with cyanide. I mean, Madera Wine and cakes is quite a rich, isn't it? Yeah. What are you saying? It should be beers and crisps. Laced with cyanide. Like if they're trying to get me and it's cakes with like in Madera Wine, I'm like, I just have a bit much. Well, I guess he probably hasn't planned many assassinations and he's getting a bit dastardly with it. He's basing off novels. He's read it. Yeah. Like the wine and the cake and the... I'm also apparently the British Secret Service planned this with him. Right. Apparently. Anthony Beaver thinks... Bevo. Bevo. Anthony Bevo thinks the British Secret Service would have involved in killing Rasputin. Okay. Well, Bevo says. You know the rules. Yeah. So he eats the cakes. He's like... He's like a 10-year-old Fintailer with a straight-man's pie. He's scoffed the cakes. He's licking... Licking their lips. The ice seeing off the cake. Yeah. He downs the Madera Wine. Whole bottle of it. I mean, Madera Wine is nice on its own with cakes. Anyway. Scoffed out. And then he's like, what's next? Come on. When we fucking? I want to fuck you. I've had my wine with my cakes. I want to fuck. Brilliant. The guys are like... The staring at him. Is there any even flicker of... You want to fuck my wife? And he's like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You think I smell bad? Wait till I show you this. Get this hog out. It smells even worse than the goat. So then what they do is they go, hey, do you know what? I've got this massive, jeweled crucifix you'll probably like because you're a priest, remember? And he's like, am I? Oh, yeah, fuck my priest. Yeah, whatever, whatever. So he goes to show him the crucifix and he bends down to see the crucifix and then use puff or is made shoots in three times in the back, like a hero. By the way, to cover up the sounds of this assignations during this, they've got a gramophone. That's right. Playing Yankee Doodle Dandy. Top of the hip-ray in 1916. Which does just set the scene brilliantly. Get the YouTube video up and just skip ahead. So this is playing shoots him three times. And then, so then they like, right, let's move the body. And they turn him over, right? And they go to start just like zipping him up and then he goes, ah! And then they go, ah, fuck! And then he's like, they run away because they're scared. And then they come back and he's just completely gone. Yeah. And he is, and this is a very cinematic, he's now, it's like, it's one in the morning. Yeah. It's December in Russia. It's freezing. It's snow everywhere. And Rasputin is like trudging on his hands and legs. Blowing. Blowing. Blowing. You think I smell bad? I don't know, I'm bleeding. It's not like Nosferatu. He's trying to fuck people. Yeah. He's trying to fuck people he sees in the street. Yeah. He's getting his hog out. Then they come up behind him and they shoot him in the back of the head. Brilliant. And then they go, they wrap him in chains and they go chuck him in a river. Underneath the ice. Underneath the ice, right? But then when they find the body the next day, they find that there's water in his lungs, which means that he was still breathing, even though he'd been shot in the head. I think, and, he had ice underneath his fingernails and there was scratch mark under the ice. So he'd been, he'd been, the rumor goes, the myth is that he'd been alive all this time as cockroach and he only actually died from drowning. Before that, when they throw in the water, apparently he comes back to life and wants to get in the water. In the water he comes out and they shoot. Yeah. Crazy. And then they chop his hog off and pick it up. They chop off his hog off and pick it up. And pick it up and pick it up. And that's when he dies. Yeah. It's like Samson's hair. Cut his hog off and he's like, all right, I'm done. So December 1916, Rasputin dies and they think this will save. It was the PR of the Royal family more than anything. Yeah. When Nicholas finds out, he's absolutely devastated. He's like, well, fuck am I going to get my gear now? Yeah. And there's our reeners obviously, distraught. Yeah. So Rasputin, Rasclot Putin, as he's had his last split, he's dead. However, he died. What actually happened was that Yusupov wrote a book about the assassination. A salacious novel. And it was around the same time as the first horror film, not for R2. So that's probably what actually happened. Right. Is that he made it all up to try and save it. Right, right, right. Anyway, Rasputin dies. But what has been set in motion by his corruption and his, you know, his, he was, he was really the real star for the last two years of his life. Yeah. What's been set in motion is the absolute complete collapse of Russia as a monarchy. And who's going to take advantage? Who's going to steal the momentum?

      "text": "Hello and welcome to the latest podcast episode of my friend podcast with me, Bejokentan. Uh, hello, hello, hello, how have you guys been doing? I've been doing great. I've been having a bit of a renaissance, if you will, just, you know, taking a step back and really reassessing like what I want out of life and how I can get the life that I want and what are the steps I can take to build the life that I want. And it's been really helpful just writing down and articulating what you want to see your life look like in five, 10 years. And I highly recommend all of you do it. I've been doing a lot of disconnecting from my phone and a lot of reconnecting with my surroundings, which has just boosted my mental health so much. And I went to a cabin in the woods and worked on a pilot that I've been writing and got some really good work done that I'm very proud of. And I will be finished with that soon and I will be selling it. So if anyone's listening to this and works at Netflix or Hulu, hit me up. And God, what else has been going on? Oh my goodness. I went to a healer. Okay. So whatever that means. By the way, I should profess this with saying that like, I am fully for Western medicine, I'm for Eastern medicine, I'm for whatever the fuck works for you. So if you feel better after you do it, all good. But anyway, I went to this. Actually, he's not a healer. He's a breathwork guy. And essentially, we did an hour of really, really intense breathwork, which was I really struggle like putting the experience into words because I like seizured and like, sterechly laughed and cried. And it was pretty insane. But essentially, the takeaway from the whole thing was that he told me I needed to stop using a vibrator. Yes, a vibrator, to masturbate with. And I was like, really, that's that's the takeaway from all this, not like my emotional trauma and baggage from my father. Wait, I need to stop using a vibrator. And he's like, yep, that's all you got to do. He basically told me if I stop using my Hitachi magic wand, which if you guys follow me on Instagram, you know that I love, that my entire life will turn around. So we're going to give it a go. I also finished a script with my friend, Zach. We wrote this really funny kind of Napoleon dynamite mini movie that sat in Texas in 1992. And it's like 30 minutes long. And we're going to kickstart it. So I apologize in advance if you follow me on Instagram because I am going to be that annoying ass girl that's like, hey, we have a kickstarter. Did you donate? And you're going to be like, no, because I don't care. And I'm going to be pleased. And then you're going to donate a little bit of money. And then I'm going to make that thing and you're going to watch it and you're going to be like, wow, I'm so glad I donated to make this happen. And okay, I'm going to stop boring you guys. We're going to just jump into that episode. This episode is with maybe a girl. Maybe a girl is her name. It's also her show name. She's running for the 28th congressional district, which is like silver lake, Echo Park, Glowsefielders, Hollywood, pretty much all the good spots of LA. And she's running against Adam Schiff. And for those of you who don't live in California, Adam Schiff is like a huge democratic powerhouse. It's pretty much a household name, especially after these impeachment hearings when he became such a star. But Adam Schiff is fine. I don't feel like he's a progressive, but maybe a girl is so cool. And her platform is so good. And she's freaking awesome. So I really, really encourage you to vote for her on March 3rd and the primary. By the way, I made a voter cheat sheet of voter guide. And that's located in my Instagram story highlights. Please use it. Please share it. I did so much research. By the way, you can vote now. You don't have to wait till March 3rd. In LA, there's voting centers all over the city. There's thousands of them actually. And you can go right now. So and if you don't live in LA, just make sure you know what the hell's going on. Like go vote. Just register. Figure out what you got to do in advance. I don't care who you're voting for. Just vote. And then just I'm really stoked about where Bernie is. He's the front runner right now. I really didn't ever think that was possible because I would have thought that the democratic establishment was going to just like pull him, pull him all the way down, but they haven't yet. So yay, Bernie. Okay. And you know, the drill, become a patron of mine if you're listening to these episodes in your love in them. Oh, my new sponsor. What am I talking about? You guys, I have the coolest new sponsor. Okay. So some of you guys have heard of Paul Stammett's. He's a myologist. If you listen to Joe Rogan, he's come on there a bunch of times. He is so amazing. He studies mushrooms. And he is determined to kind of revive the declining B population. He's truly inspiring. He's been on Joe Rogan a bunch. I feel like that's how a lot of people know him. I'm obsessed with him. You should listen to the Joe Rogan episodes with him. And you should also follow him on Instagram. But anyway, so he teamed up with Paul Taylor, I think, and designed this B mushroomed feeder, a B M F. And this B feeder is a delivery system for mushroom, mycelium extract, which helps the immune system of the bees. And, you know, they've done so much research. And basically, it indicates that the mushroom mycelium provides essential nutrition to the immune, immune bit of the bees. So any who, you can go by one of these feeders and put it out. And they're going to be clutty data on bees. And we're going to be turning around the B population one feeder at a time. I don't think they're available to buy quite yet. Let me see. I'm on the website actually right now. Oh, okay. Yeah. So, so you can sign up for the email list on B mushroom.com for how to be notified when the next steps become available, how to get one. They're working on a few aspects right now. I expect to make them available in the spring of 2020. But you can start by signing up for their email list and following them on Instagram, be mushroom dot com bees are so critically important to this world, to our food supply, to everything. So please, please do this. This is such a cool product. Go sign up. I'm signed up. And yeah, that's it. Love you guys very much. And here's the episode. So your name is maybe a girl. Yes, my name is maybe a girl. How long has that been your name? So technically it's my my stage name, my performance name, my drag name. But I go by maybe all the time. So I don't just go by maybe when I'm performing as a drag queen. I'm also known as maybe a girl in my political life. Tell me how you kind of got to this path where you've decided to run for the 28th congressional district against Adam Schiff. Yes. So it has been it's been a crazy year. Well, 2019, I should say, was a crazy year. I ran for office in Los Angeles. I ran for the Silver Lake neighborhood council. And it was really cool because I ran with 11, 11 other people. They were all progressives. And we formed a slate or a coalition known as the known as Silver Lake progressive. And the ideal thing happened. All 11 of us ended up being elected onto the council. And we have a the council has 21 members. So with 11 progressives joining the council, we effectively have a progressive majority, which is really cool. So we've been able to do some really amazing things on the neighborhood council. And one of the things that I'm a little bit frustrated with in that position is that it is not a legislative position. The neighborhood councils act as advisory boards to city council. And that's frustrating because I want to be more proactive in changing the laws that the government people, especially marginalized people. Right. And which is why you're choosing to run for Congress. Exactly. So I identify as a progressive Democrat. And I'm running up against one of the most powerful Democrats in office right now, not just in California, but the whole US, the spotlight has been on Adam Schiff because of his involvement with the Mueller report and now his involvement with the impeachment. He's been hearing, right. He's become quite the star. He has become quite the star. In fact, it's funny. I was checking the news this morning and there he was right on the cover. And I think a lot of people think of him as this national hero because of his involvement with the impeachment. However, what I think a lot of people fail to realize is that he is actually quite a conservative Democrat. Totally. He's not a progressive by any means. By any means, but a lot of people think that he is. Yeah, totally. So I totally agree with you. I think he's consistently voted for increases in the military budget. Absolutely. Yeah. He has a pretty shaky position on Israel Palestine. Like there's a lot of areas where he is somewhat like Republican. Exactly. Which is, yeah, it's really shocking. I mean, with many social issues, he does, you know, lean a little bit more liberal, but I'm pretty anti-war and I am appalled at, you know, some of the votes that he's made in his almost 20-year tenure. Like you said, he consistently votes in favor of the military. He voted for the Iraq War. He voted to keep troops in Afghanistan. He voted to support the Saudi invasion of Yemen. And just recently, he voted to pass the national defense authorization act, which is the military budget for 2020. And he gave the military $738 billion. And yet people say that we can't pay for Medicare for All. We can't pay for tuition-free college. We absolutely can. We just need to reallocate military spending. Absolutely. I totally agree with you. What made you get interested in politics in the first place? What made you want to even run for this? For the Silver Lake neighborhood council. Silver Lake neighborhood council. Well, I just, I, I filled out my paperwork to apply to run for office for that position January last year, but I had actually had interest in running for that position a year before, but I just missed the filing deadline. So I said I'm going to do it the next election cycle. But I've actually always had an interest in politics, in civic life, in, you know, the way the governments operate and the way that people interact and engage with their governments. I actually in when I was living in Chicago, which is where I grew up, I actually did try to get into politics back then. And I tried to run for office, but I failed to get the number of signatures to get on the, to get on the ballots. Got it. But yeah, when, when I ended up winning this local election, it just, it was really empowering, not just for me, but for my community, for, you know, for queer people. And I think it's just so important that we get more queer people in office. Was totally, was that hard to do? Was that hard to get elected? Like what, what went into that process? You know, if anyone else is listening and yeah, and I would encourage people to get involved. Joining one of the, the neighborhood councils, I think, first of all, it's so important because it's the most grassroots level of government and it's the way it's the form of government that most affects the community that you live in. And I think that a lot of people pay attention to national politics. Absolutely. And have no idea what's going on right now. They're on back. You're on. Yeah. So that's where I think you can enact the most change. So I would encourage people to try to make it happen. If anybody is interested in doing it, essentially what you do is you would contact the neighborhood council in your neighborhood district. There's 99 of them across the city. So no matter where you live in the city, you're a part of one of the neighborhood councils. And I would say first go to a meeting, see what they're like and see if it's something that you would be interested in. For me, the first couple of meetings that I went to before I was even running, I found them so fascinating, just the way that community members interact with each other and with the council. And it's funny. Everybody has a different opinion on everything. And I think when we think of politics, we think a lot of a lot of fundamental, right or wrong issues. But there's so many issues that you vote on and that you discuss that aren't necessarily right or wrong issues. And you have to decide, you know, who is this going to benefit the most? Who's going to be negatively impacted? Who's coming out to their local government and saying, this is what is happening? This is how I want you to vote. This is how I don't want you to vote. So, you know, just being a really good representative, I think requires you to be engaged with your community. And I think that a lot of people are seeking ways to get more engaged with their community and joining the neighborhood council, I think is a perfect way to do it. Great, great, great for a stop. So you run and drag. And so what influenced that decision? And then when did you start doing drag? And how has that affected kind of your like political career? Yeah, so when I decided to run for the neighborhood council, I was initially planning on putting my legal name on the ballot just because I figured that's what I would have to do. But there was actually, there was one slot for your legal name and then one for the name as you wanted to appear on the ballot. And I said, oh cool. Well, I think I'm just going to run as my stage name because that's how most people in my community know me. Most people don't know my legal name. And so if you're, you know, it'll just be easier for me. Plus, I think it is just such clear visibility for queer people. And you know, it's, I always say it's hard to ignore the seven foot tall woman in the room. So people definitely pay attention to you when you are in drag. And also for me, one of the decisions for doing that is not so much for it to be a show. But more so for the visibility. But for me personally, I identify as trans, I identify as gender fluid. So for me, it's really part of my gender expression and not just me putting on a costume. Got it. Um, so when did you did, did you're doing drag and influence you identifying as trans or? Yeah, actually, it's it. In fact, so I started doing drag about a little more than five years ago. And I'd always had an interest in everything that, you know, females, you know, get to wear in terms of clothes. And that was always jealous of the heels and the accessories. And when I started doing drag and I started performing in drag, I loved it. And I never wanted to take it off after the gig. And I noticed that a lot of the other queens that I work with as soon as they step off the stage, they're ripping their wigs off, taking everything off. And I like to keep it on the rest of the night. And so I really started thinking about it. Well, I probably sleep with my makeup more than I should. But don't it's terrible. I know. No, don't look too closely. But yeah, so that, uh, that really helped me to realize my gender identity. And it made me realize that I'm not a cis gender male. So, um, but yeah, but drag also really helped me to get more involved in politics. You know, I started to realize the, the political and social value of drag. I think just going out in drag in and of itself is a political and social savings. And when the Trump administration came in in early 2017, I started to do impersonations of a lot of the female, um, members of that, of that size. Okay, which ones? Uh, Kellyanne Conway. Okay, I need to see. I will definitely show you at Melania Trump, uh, that's C. DeVos. Um, Sarah Huckabee Sanders. So all the, all the great, exactly, exactly. But, uh, I would do numbers that were satirical and they were entertaining, but also educational in a sense. When I started doing these characters, I was really bothered by the fact that some of the people that watched me perform didn't know who these people were. And I think that really, you know, disturbed me that a lot of people don't know what's going on. So I try to use the numbers to kind of give people a little bit of an idea of what's going on in politics right now. Totally. Um, have any other drag queens tried to run for office? So I, when I won, I actually didn't even know this, but I, I found out because, uh, and, um, LA magazine didn't article on me and they said, um, meet the first drag queen elected a public office in California. And I was like, oh, wow, I had no idea. And I thought that was so cool. And I started doing my own research and I couldn't find any other drag queens that have been elected to any office in the whole US. So I'm pretty certain that I'm the first drag queen elected to public office. Nobody else has said otherwise. Now there are other queens that are involved in politics. Sure. Um, there's a queen. Her name's Honey Mahogany and she lives up in San Francisco and she has a political position. Um, but I believe she was appointed, you know, still amazing, but to have people, you know, come out and vote, I think is really amazing. And I think it's something that 15, 20 years ago, I don't think it happened. Yeah. Uh, there's also another drag queen. Her name is Marty Good Cummings and she is, she lives in New York and she's running for City Council in New York right now. So, um, you're starting to see, you know, the queens come in. Yeah. Is there any politicians in particular that inspired you to run and to get involved? Are there any that you really admire? Oh, totally. I would say absolutely AOC. Yeah. AOC, the whole squad. Um, I think that they're all fantastic. I love everything that they stand for. And, you know, they're progressives to the bone. Um, yeah. You know, I'm really a huge fan of Bernie. Um, I do like Elizabeth Warren. Also, um, I'm voting for Bernie. Hell yeah. And, uh, I hate what's going on with my. Oh my gosh. I know. I know. What the hell is this? I really hated because I, this is the last thing we need. I know exactly. I'm getting on the same ticket. Exactly. It's like happening all over again. This is like what happened in 2016. So, you know, I'll vote for any Democrat, you know, on the ticket, but I'm hoping that it's Bernie Sanders and or Elizabeth Warren. Yeah. Absolutely. So let's talk about your platform. What are the, you know, what are the issues you're focused on? What do you care about? What are you fighting for? Yeah. So, um, I, I would say pretty much all progressive ideals. I'm sort of fighting for, but I would say in particular, the ones that I'm fighting for most would be LGBT QIA issues and ending homelessness. Yeah. Which are also the big issues that I'm currently focusing on in the neighborhood council. So, on the council, one of my positions is, um, I'm one of the homelessness liaisons. So, I interface between the neighborhood council and our homelessness committee, um, you know, to try to come up with solutions for homelessness in Silver Lake. Um, I'm also co-chair of the LGBT QIA committee and, uh, you know, those two issues are really what I'm passionate about. But I'm also for Medicare for All, for the Green New Deal. I'm here for abolishing ICE, uh, for women's rights. Essentially, there's three main elements to my platform to protect, to advocate and to legislate, to protect women, protect minorities, protect immigrants, protect the environment, uh, to advocate for diversity, representation, inclusion, and to legislate for progressive action. So, that's essentially what I, I hope, to accomplish in Congress. Amazing. So, yeah, with homelessness, I feel like that's one of the biggest. It's a huge issue. It's a huge issue. Not just here, but in the entire nation. And I think, uh, but LA really died. LA, it's in, yeah, it's horrible right now to crisis. Yeah, it's a crisis. It's a crisis. It's a crisis. And, you know, that's one of the things that I feel that our current Congress person Adam Schiff has not done anything to, you know, to fix, um, uh, 2019, of 2018, homelessness increased 12% in LA County and 16% in the city of LA. And in certain parts of the district that I'm running in, such as Burbank, it increased 40%. Um, it's just, it's remarkable. And so, let's unpack that a little bit. Do we think that that it's just because of like exponentially rising, um, housing costs where people just have no kind of protection. There's no link low income housing. Um, I think it's, it's a combination of factors that has created this deadly, literally deadly situation for homeless people in LA. I do think that it's, you know, the lack of affordable housing. I mean, even what they call affordable housing is not affordable to any people. Oh, no, it's not affordable for anyone even making a decent income. Exactly. It's a shortage of homes or of housing. I totally support the vacancy tax, which would, which would tax developers and landlords that have, and no, exactly. When was this introduced? It's something that's going through right now with the city of LA. So, um, it's being spearheaded partial in part by Councilman David Rue of city council district four. And so that's something that I support. You know, I think that it puts pressure on, you know, on developers and landlords. Because there's all these empty fucking luxury apartments sitting there while we have 60,000 people on the streets. Yeah, there are actually more empty, there's more empty units in LA than there are homeless people. It's, it's wild. I didn't even know about that. That obviously seems like a really good solution. So I will say the city has taken steps to address it. Um, you know, they've raised, you know, there's a sales tax that goes towards, um, towards homeless funding. But I think it's really about intentionally building housing for low income people and for, you know, people that are experiencing homelessness. They need homes. They need homes. Exactly. It's, it's not just job training. It's not just, um, you know, uh, you know, substance treatment. It's not like, they need actual homes to live in because it's hard to do anything if you don't have a roof above your head. Yeah. I think it's also about preventing homelessness and sort of tackling the problem before it even happens, you know, ending the cycle of homelessness. I will also say that as much as the city and county are, you know, claiming to do things for homeless people, they've also been enacting legislation that criminalizes the, the homeless. Yeah, there's these crazy sweeps that are happening. The sweeps. You can't sleep in your car. You'll get ticketed, which I think is despicable that they would rather put people on the streets than let them sleep in their car, which can be locked. And, you know, it's just, it's a safety thing. It's a, you know, a humane thing. Uh, you, they also just enacted the sit, uh, sit-ly sleep law, which means that you can't sleep within 500 feet of a park or a school or a shelter, ironically. Um, you can't sleep within 10 or 15 feet of a driveway. It's, it's like, where can you sleep? Where can you sleep? You know, it's interesting. I took parts in this event a couple of months ago with, um, a couple of my friends called, uh, Sleep Out America. And we actually, the idea was to raise money and awareness for people that are living on the streets. So we purchased a tent and we pitched it actually right in front of Adam's ship's office, uh, on Hollywood Boulevard and, you know, tried to sleep out for the night. And it was one of the most terrifying experiences of my life. I felt so unsafe. Oh my god. You know, obviously it was not comfortable sleeping on the ground, but also we were hassled so hard by the security in the building. We move next door, the security in the next building starts to hassle us. Um, finally, we get them to leave us alone. Finally, fall asleep and at five in the morning, they start banging on the tent. And I didn't know who was banging on the tent. They're like, you gotta get out. You gotta get out. And I'm like, you know, I didn't know if this was a security person or if this was, you know, who knows it ended up being a security person. And they ended up forcing us out around five a.m. So, but we left the tent for somebody else to take. So, but it was, it was a really interesting and insightful experience. And, you know, it's hard enough to have to live on the streets, but you can't even get the support of, you know, just your neighbors. Having some more just to sleep. Yeah. Oh, it's so terrible. It's so terrible, but I do understand that it's a complex complex. It is. And I think it just needs to be approached from different angles, you know, it's housing. It is social services. It's, you know, approaching, you know, mental health. It's approaching addiction. Yeah, but it also just ties into Medicare for all. Like we're all one bad health, you know, accident away from being homeless. Yeah. And, you know, in some ways, and I don't, you know, some people have experienced a situation where they're just completely crushed with bills and some people haven't, but it's a scary thing if you don't have those funds saved up. And most people don't. Though, yeah, homelessness is a big one. Where do you sit with prison reform? What's your? Yeah, I'm totally, I'm totally in favor of prison reform. I think it's a part of addressing racial injustice in our nation. I believe that private prison should be abolished. I don't think that people should be profiting off of people. So that's definitely something I want to see happen. I believe in California there, you know, on the path to making that happen, but I'd love to see that happen nationally. Yeah. There's a piece of legislation that'll be on the March 3rd ballot about stopping building more jails. So yeah, I've been canvassing for that. That's really awesome. I really hope that that passes. And I, one of the things that I love about California is California tends to be that state where we always do it first and then everybody follows suits. Yeah. So, you know, I hope to, I hope to see that happen. Yeah. And then obviously, Adam Schiff has a, I'm assuming much bigger budget. He does. Much, much bigger budget. Much, much bigger budget. So how does that work? How do you race funds? And like, how does that affect your, you know, your life? I will say, you know, fundraising has been one of the, you know, one of the more daunting parts of running for Congress. And it is a sad fact that you have to have money to, you know, to be in the game. It really should not be that way at all. But we are running a totally grassroots campaign. We're not taking any sort of corporate donations and you sort of dirty money whatsoever. I wish I could say the same for my opponent, Adam Schiff. But he has one of the dirtiest records in terms of campaign donors, which actually ties into what we were talking about earlier with, you know, the military spending. If you take a look at Adam Schiff's donors, his donors are, you know, from the defense industry, their weapons makers. Yeah. And I think it's really unethical for Congress people to take money from industries and then vote in favor of these industries. It's just, it's like, who are you working for? The industries are the people. I know. And that's why we need Bernie and all that. Exactly. So I'd love to see campaign finance reform. I'd love to see, you know, all candidates just taking individual small donations. That's probably not likely to happen soon. But that's something that I think that all candidates should do from an ethical and ethical point of view. So, so what's your hope like, you know, with running? What is your desired outcome? Are you hoping to just push the conversation more left? Are you in this to win this? Are you like where what's your big goal? We are definitely in this to win this. I would not have run if I didn't think that I had a chance of winning. And I do, I do know that I have a chance of winning. California does their primary, it's a top two primary. Sometimes referred to as a jungle primary where rather than electing the Republican and Democratic nominee for any office, it's the top two vote getters that move onto the general election. So it can be two Democrats or two Republicans that are in the general. So, who's the Republican candidate? So there are actually there's seven candidates. Oh. So there is myself. There are there's three other Democrats that are running. And there are two Republicans and then one conservative leaning independence. And so, you know, with the interesting thing about it being a crowded primary is that it's it's really anybody's game. So this the primary election is going to determine who Adam Schiff's opponent is going to be in the general election. Adam Schiff will definitely win the primary with the most amount of votes. It's all about who gets the second amount of votes. Yes. And who can then prove themselves throughout the course of the general election, you know, before November 2020. So I only need to get one more vote than any other person running against Adam Schiff. Right. And then it'll be between you two. Exactly. Now, the reason that I think people should vote for me in the primary election, regardless of whether or not they're going to vote for me in the general election is because if you vote for maybe in the primary, we guarantee that we'll be keeping the Democratic seat because there will be two Democrats running for the seat. Yeah. And a lot of people hate Adam Schiff right now. A lot of Republicans hate Adam Schiff right now. And a guarantee that Republicans are going to be coming out in droves to vote this year. So I don't want to see even a slight possibility of us having to lose the seat. Yeah. So I think, you know, a vote for maybe guarantees that we're at least keeping the seat and then the people get to decide, you know, do we want a moderate or do we want a progressive? Right. Back to fundraising. Like, do you find that fundraising is essential to the success of your campaign? Or is this? I would say yes. Yes and no. Yes and no. I mean, money is definitely important and we've needed money for a lot of different things. You know, everything from actually filing to, you know, getting marketing materials and swag and, you know, there's just a lot of different areas where money needs to be poured into. But one of the great things about my campaign is I have a ton of volunteers that are all, you know, willing to go out to do this not for me, but for us for the cause for the progressive cause. Yeah. Because that's what I want people to know is this is not about me as an individual getting elected. It's about getting more progressives into office. And especially if it's a progressive, such as a trans person because there's never been a trans person in no representation. So exactly. How can we as trans people, as queer people, trust that we're being accurately and fairly represented when we're not being represented by people in our community who don't know what our struggles are? Totally. Yeah, no, it's refreshing to see anyone who's not like a white man in this suit. Exactly. Yeah. And then back to canvassing. So, you know, I just recently did it for my first time and I found it to be such a, it was, it was a really interesting experience. Absolutely. You get to like just knock on these people's doors. Everyone's so different with their mannerisms, if they're warm, if they're cold, how they react to what you're saying. And I found it a bit stressful and it took a while to get comfortable with. But I know that you've been doing that often, right? Yeah, we've been canvassing multiple times a week. You know, it started off with us getting signatures to get on the ballots. And now we're at a point where we are, you know, distributing information. So you're handing out our door hangers and our flyers. When it was about getting signatures, you know, let me back up a second. I will say that canvassing was one of the things that I was least looking forward to about the campaign. You know, I love interacting with people and engaging with people. But it's a different story when you're asking somebody to have their vote. You know, and you, you know, sometimes feel this if you have to impress them, you know, in order to get that vote, if they don't know, you or know anything about you. But I will say that canvassing has ended up being one of the most, one of the best parts of the campaign for me. I've so enjoyed actually getting to talk to the people in my community about what's important to them in terms of, you know, what do you vote for? What do you vote against? What's important to you? Because we always have, we all have issues that are especially important to us. And sometimes it's important to understand what is most important to other people. Totally. So it's been a positive experience. It's been a generally very positive experience. We've only, in fact, I'm a little bit shocked that we haven't had very much negative, very many negative interactions with people. I was kind of expecting it. And there's only been a small handful out of the thousands of people that we've reached out to at this point. See, I had some negative experiences. But I was in Pasadena. I don't know where you've been canvassing, probably the area. I think that depends also. Yeah, we've been canvassing. We'll kind of all over the district, but we have been focusing a lot on this side of the Hollywood Hills, which is, I don't know if I mentioned where the district is, but it's West Hollywood, Hollywood, Silver Lake, Echo Park, at Water Village, Burbank, Glendale, part of Pasadena. And then it goes all the way north up through Sunland and La Crescenta, La Cunata, Flint Ridge, all the way up to the LA Forest. So back to the point, yes, where you canvass, you definitely get different reactions in different people. But that's I think why it's important to go all over to really get a good sample. But we have also been focusing on areas where we know there are a lot of progressives and a lot of liberal people that want to see change. Yeah, with canvassing, you can't change people's minds with facts. I've kind of figured out. And what I was doing when I was training for was something called deep canvassing where you just use personal stories and empathy to sway people or, you know, get them to listen. And it was really interesting because it was a really hard thing to do was just like to open up and be vulnerable and to talk to them and try to be like, you know, this was about building more jails. So you would go to doors and just be like, how do you feel about jails? Who do you think belongs in jail? You know, ask them these questions. And then to hear them say like, I think there should be more jails. I think bad people deserve to go to jail, you know, hard stop. And then after like sharing a personal story and having them share a personal story, they've kind of like by the end of it, swayed where they were on the, you know, spectrum. And that was just such an interesting experience and really hard to do. So I have a lot of respect for you. Yeah, it sounds like it's been a good experience. No, but that's such a good point that you make because people respond to people not numbers, you know, I mean, the numbers help explain the story sometimes, but you know, there's stories behind all of the reasons that we want to see these changes. Yeah, but I was just in the beginning of it. I was like, is this really the best use of my time and of everyone else's time? And then I'm like, I guess it, it is really important to get face and face with people. Like you said, you said at the beginning, it was really hard. You do kind of, I think it gets easier. It does get easier. You know, you have to warm up. Even I will say I always have to warm up even that day. Like I sort of ease into it. And then by the end, I'm like, I could do this all day. But yeah, the first couple are always, you know, hard to, hard to gauge. Yeah. So do you just like, does the drag community like no, are they very like? Yeah, the drag community is totally aware. They've been really supportive. In fact, you know, one of the ways that we've been fundraising, we've had a number of fundraisers and our fundraisers have included drag shows. So I've had the support of a lot of queens and kings who have donated their, you know, their time and their tips to, to the cause. Also one of the really great things about being a drag queen provides a unique advantage in the sense that I get to talk about my campaign at every single show. I produce a number of shows. But even in the shows where I'm just a guest, you know, they usually will let me jump on the microphone for a few minutes. And I've got the attention of an entire room of people, you know, that are potential voters. And you know, tell them about, you know, who I am, what I believe in. And please come out and vote. And where are you from? Like, what was your upbringing like? So I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1986. And my family moved to Chicago when I was nine to the suburbs. And I moved to the city for school. And then I lived in Chicago until I was 27. And then I moved to LA. And I've been here for about six years now. Okay, amazing. But my childhood was, I mean, it was very normal in many ways, but also very normal for, you know, a queer kid coming to terms with their queerness, you know, my family now is very supportive of me and of my campaign. Great. You know, they're extremely proud. But not to say that, you know, I came out of the closet and it was, you know, a parade right away. You know, it took, it took some time for them to adjust to it. But my family is really supportive and I'm really lucky for that because not every queer person has that. No, no, they don't. And then what were you doing before you were kind of pursuing this political path? So I used to be a tour guide actually. I did architectural tours in Chicago. My specialty was Frank Lloyd Wrights. Oh, cool. Yeah, I love modern architecture and I had my own tour company. And we didn't really do much in the winter because nobody wants to go on a tour of Chicago in January. No, no, they don't. I have been to Chicago in January. And it was truly fucked up. Yeah, I think my eyelashes like froze off. Oh, I believe I had an earlips. And that's not an exaggeration. And someone was like, cover that up. It was like negative 27 when I was there. Here's this three, no matter how many layers you're wearing. I'm just like, what the fuck do you do when it's negative 27? You stay inside. Call off. Call off live. So that was actually a huge reason for wanting to move to LA, of course, the weather. So I initially wanted to be a snow bird. I wanted to live in LA in the winter and give tours here in Los Angeles and then give tours in Chicago during the spring and summer. And so I started that and I came out here for a winter and started giving some local tours. One of the reasons I wanted to do it here in LA is because LA has such incredible architecture, especially on a residential level. Sure. And as I mentioned, Frank Lloyd Wright was kind of my special team. He did a concentration of buildings out here in LA. So yeah, I was doing tours at first when I came out here and then I went back to Chicago and I was planning on coming back here for the following winter. But I decided, you know what? I was like, I'm just moving to LA. I was like, I love LA. So I ended up moving here full time in 2014. And when I came out here, I started doing tours. And I sort of after a while, just kind of, it wasn't giving me the same creative fulfillment that at once had it started to feel more like a job. And, you know, as an artist, when you feel like it's a job, you start to lose that creative passion for it. So, but I think part of that reason was that's around the time when I was getting, when I was starting drag. And that's really where my creative juices can can flow. Amazing. And where do you perform drag? I perform all across the city. Mostly on the east side and downtown. I host and produce a drag brunch every Saturday at the standard hotel called Wakes and Waffles. It's so fun. It's the one in downtown. It's on fifth and flower. So we do that every Saturday on Mondays. We do drag bingo at the standard as well. I do a show on Monday nights at the offbeat bar. I was supposed to go to drag bingo recently. You should come come to the one at the standard. Yeah, my friend Eleanor goes all the time. Yeah. Okay. And then yeah, I'm involved with a couple of other monthly productions. I'm on the rotating cast for a couple of different shows. So stay pretty busy with drag. But it's interesting. I thought it was going to take a step back when I started running for office. But as I mentioned, sort of having that unique advantage of getting to talk to the crowd. Yeah, I can talk to all these people. Something I really can't pass up for the campaign, you know. So, so I've actually taken on more gigs than I probably normally would. Right. And then let's see. So what do you, how do you feel about like what's going on right now, currently with politics, with like the impeachment, hearings and all that? You know, I think, well, it's going to be interesting to find out how it all goes down. You know, today they started the, you know, the Senate trial. So I think the next few weeks are going to be very, very much about the impeachment. I'm curious to see how long it goes on for. You know, I feel like they could make it kind of quick, but I could also see it being dragged out. I, you know, I think it's a distraction in some ways. Me too. If the other things that are going on, such as this potential war with Iran, you know, I find the timing of it all to be very peculiar. I don't see it as a positive thing. Well, yeah, I mean, I think we would all love to see him removed from office, but I think we also know it's not going to happen. And the only thing that I see happening from this is like just getting his base fired the fuck up. He'll be fired up because he's acquitted. You know, he's going to be, you know, rubbing it in the faces of, you know, what he calls the do nothing, Democrats, you know, for the rest of his term. Yeah. And like you said, it's going to, you know, fire up his base. You know, ideally he does get removed, but I just, it's not. I don't see that happening. You know, I just don't see that happening with the, you know, the Senate majority. So yeah, I think I just want him to fail like on his own terms. Exactly. I would love to just see him voted out this, this November. Totally. And do you think what do you think about his chances of being reelected? You know, I hate to say it, but I really don't know what's going to happen. This, this next election. I think that I'm hoping that we see what we saw in the 2018 midterms where a lot of Democrats, you know, come out because they know how important it is now that he's in office to get him out and to get, you know, his, his, you know, people that side with him out as well. So 2018 saw a lot of people come out and vote. I hope that people come out and vote this year. Yeah. And I think that we do have a chance of winning, you know, the seat, winning the office back. Obviously, I would love to see that be Bernie Sanders. But, but I'll support anybody. I'll support any Democrat. He's so consistent. He's been working for so long. He really has. I love one too, but I'm all, I'm all for Bernie. Same. He's my guy. He's my guy. So just on a, on a personal note, are you, since politics is a big part of your life, do you have any people in your life that don't share your political views? Like, are you friends with any? A very interesting question. I would say, I would say most of the people that I interact with share similar political points of view, maybe not all, but I don't really have any friends that are on the other side. I don't really have any Republicans friends per se, but I do have some friends that are moderate Democrats that are, you know, I'm friends with a couple of people that plan on voting for Biden. Yeah, I know. But I'm like, I cannot be your friend just because of that. No, of course not. Of course not. I think actually, it's important actually. It's so important to not be surrounded only by people. In your bubble. Exactly. Yeah, that's my, that's my only kind of issue with being in the liberal bubble is it is fully a bubble. It is. Yeah. And I think it is important to engage in dialogue with people who have opposing views from your own. It's hard to do. It is. Yeah. But it's something that we've lost as a nation, like the ability to just have constructive conversation. And I've noticed that I'm a victim of it as well. And I, you know, for sure, I think one of the reasons that is is happening, though, is I think that, you know, there's a lot at stake. And I think that the people that, you know, when, when people's rights are at stake, I think it's hard not to get, you know, personally defensive about things. Yeah. It's really hard. It's just hard not to regurgitate things without like critically looking at everything. And like, yeah, I do get bothered when, even when I see, and you see a lot of it on like Twitter and Facebook, you see a lot of these back and forths when somebody posts something political, and then you have somebody else chime in that has a different, you know, point of view. And the back and forth, like it gets ugly sometimes. And I think to myself, you know, these, these two people met on the street, they probably could have a decent conversation and engage and relate, you know, in some way. It's so much easier to get nasty. Yeah. And I've been, I don't know if it's just me because I'm in politics, but I've been seeing so much politics on, on my, on my social media. That's good. It is good. You know, if you've gotten any like, have you been in any kind of like cyber fights? Um, not really. I've chosen to stay out one thing that I've learned is to not read the comments whenever, because I've gotten a lot of articles that have come out about my, about my running. And I had a few articles come out when I won the, uh, the local election. And so a lot of these are, some of them have actually been posted in like conservative media. And you know, I, a lot of, yeah, well, no, not that far fortunately, but a lot of conservatives are actually gagged that a drag queen is running against Adam Schiff and we actually love to see Adam get beat to a drag queen, you know. So, so there have been some conservative articles that have come out about me. And I just have learned to not read the comments because it gets ugly in the comments. And that's good that you're not personally out there. Do you know the, um, have you heard of the activist mommy? No. She's like this. She's on Twitter and on Facebook. She's got a, you know, huge following. And she, she's like basically, you know, one of those people that goes and protests any sort of event that's pro LGBT or, she's very much a conservative, she's a very conservative mommy. And anyway, she wrote a very spiteful article about me, um, but whatever. Why? Just about, about me, what about, about me running against Adam Schiff. And it was not in support of me. It was, oh, look what the world has come to, a sort of thing. Oh, yeah. This is, this is what's happening. This is where the circus is going. You know, that sort of, that sort of critique can also conservative mommy. I know, I mean, what is the activist mommy? So I can just like picture her. Yeah, like, like, but I must speak to the manager. Yeah, it's totally exactly. So, you know, the people who are listening to this, if they want to get involved, if they want to volunteer or join your cause, like, how would they just reach out to you? What, what do you need help? Thank you so much for asking because we absolutely need help. We are down to about the last 50 days until the election. And it's go time right now. We are spending pretty much every last minutes just getting the word out through phone banking, through hanging up door hangers, through everything. So if somebody wants to get involved, I would say visit our website, which is, which is maybe a girl for congress.org. That's M-A-E-B-E. And, or you can also follow me on Instagram or Twitter at maybe a girl and send us a message. And we'd love to have you join our volunteer team. You can also volunteer remotely. So if you don't even live in California and you want to help phone bank, we can send you a few phone banking sheets. Of course, we are accepting donations. Yes. So I would love if you would consider donating to our campaign. Anything a small, you know, it's a dollar, you know, I know I would, I would really have a billboard. If anybody out there has a hook up, get me a billboard. We need a billboard for me please. Just for a couple weeks. I feel like honestly, that's like the best way to get I know right? Introduction to the LA people. Yes. So if you have a billboard, please or give us the money to get a billboard. Either one word. Yes. So, but yeah, just I hope people, you know, will follow our journey. I hope people will come out and vote. If anybody needs help getting registered to vote, we're going to be having a registered vote event in a couple of weeks. So you can come out. We can help you do that. And I really just encourage everyone to get involved. Whether or not it's with my campaign or another sort of organization or cause that, you know, helps your community. Totally. That's what I say to people. I'm just like pick one thing that you care about and get involved. Yeah. But also just get involved locally. Like federal politics are not and I'll be all there's a lot happening on a local level. That's super important. And I think that that's totally changing. I think people are more engaged than ever. And I got to say that's the best thing about Donald Trump is that I have to admit that like prior to Trump, like I wasn't engaged, you know, I wasn't I wasn't paying attention. And I think that the best thing that's happened from this is that people are finally awake and like getting involved in the democratic process. I think we were all so like, you know, they know the names of their senators now. Exactly. Which was totally not the case before. I think we were snoozing like during the Obama years because we felt, you know, like I feel like we're changed. In many ways, we felt like we were in a bubble. We're like, yeah, it's weird. And then you see how quickly and how easily it could be taken away. Absolutely. And you know, the pinch alone swings both ways. It really does. So I'm hoping it's kind of swinging back. Yes. I see it swinging back. I see it swinging back. It's happening. But yeah, even just like to add to that, I feel like, you know, all of the people that have gone out now and protested and marched. And I think that, you know, it's really inspiring. And I think a lot of people are realizing that, you know, their opinion counts, their vote counts, their body and a protest counts. And yeah, I hope people just keep that up and it doesn't wane. Yeah, I agree. Okay. Well, thank you so much for chatting with me. Thank you so much. Oh, and please don't forget to vote. Yes, on maybe March. Oh, yeah, of course. And then your Instagram handle maybe a girl. Yeah, maybe a girl. M-A-E-B-E-A-G-I-L. I'll link you. I'll tag you. Yeah. Okay, great. And thank you so much for having me on this. And you want to get involved. Please reach out. And donate. It's small donations. Cal anything you can, you know, give is very appreciated. Yeah, there's a link on my Instagram page to our donation page, which is through Act Blue. And when you're done donating for, uh, to maybe donate to Bernie. Yes. Okay. All right, thanks so much. Thank you so much. All right. Bye guys. Bye.",

      "podcast": "Joshua Citarella",
      "episode": "Nick Srnicek on Platform Capitalism.txt",
      "text": "Can I ask you first maybe to introduce yourself? I think members who are longtime listeners of this channel who follow the syllabus will be familiar with your work, but casual listeners of the podcast this may be their first introduction to you. So my name is Nick Cernick. I'm a lecture in Digital Economy at Kings College London. I've written a book called Inventing the Future with Alex Williams, which is a book basically looking at how we can use technology to try and build a socialist future, particularly focused on the end of work and the sort of liberation of free time. And then I've also written a book called Platform Capitalism, which is about big tech companies, what they are, and how they're situated within a global history of capitalism. I'll give you a little bit of background for my project here because we're doing something kind of unusual. I used to be a professor at the School of Visual Arts at RISD. During that time I was also writing about young people being politicized and radicalized on social media. I feel like this is maybe part of the origin story of this project. Looking back, there is now a phenomena which we call EDologies, EDologies, which are essentially niche over-hyphenated political ideologies that are made up by teenagers producing memes online. You get extraordinarily silly and fun entertaining things like state, capitalist, jouch\u00e9, anarcho, libertarianism, and whatever. In the very beginning, there was something called fully automated luxury communism. This predates a lot of those subcultures, actually. Some of the people who now participate in it, who are ages, say, 14, 15, 16, are not aware of those origins. Fully automated luxury, gay space, communism, I might be missing a few adjectives at a certain point. Before we dive into the really serious stuff, I wonder if you could tell us about the social media response to when that first book came out, the viral responses to that? Yeah, it's interesting. I mean, the origins of the book, the heavily implicated in social media. Alex and I actually see capitalist realism in your backdrop, there, in your background. Alex, Mark, and myself used to spend long nights chatting, drinking and chatting. And one of the big issues with this was this is the time of Occupy, it was the time of the 2008 crisis, and it was the time of austerity, it was the time of rioting in London. And the question was, what is the positive vision that's being offered in all of these things? And we were always discusses, what is actually being put on offer rather than just saying inequality is bad, police oppression is bad, what else is there to that we can actually put forth? So we got to working on Alex and I, working on inventing the future, I think we probably started in 2010 or 2011. And at one point, I forget exactly the date, it may have been 2013, we got asked to write to sort of publication for this little art project. And it was going to be like, you know, 100 copies run, it was going to be a very small thing. But we decided that what we would do is basically turn all of our ideas for this book that wasn't finished, we put it into a condensed, polimical manifesto form. And this became what's now known as the accelerationist manifesto, which we called hashtag accelerate. So that sort of social media aspect was already built into the way we were sort of thinking about this stuff and the way we were trying to play with sort of cultural agendas at the moment. So that manifesto took off to our great surprise. We had no expectations about it. I can distinctly remember waking up one morning and suddenly having about 50 friend requests on Facebook, back when people still used Facebook. Wow. Yeah, the good old days. And yeah, it was just, you know, it was a complete surprise to me, but it really seemed a touch under for a variety of reasons. I think people saw a lot in it that they liked and people also saw a lot in it that they really didn't like. And I think that sort of a hallmark of a good manifesto, I think, is, you know, is not trying to appeal to everyone. So anyways, the manifesto took off. It got translated all over the place and it was, you know, spread all through the online world. And then, of course, the book, inventing the future was eventually rolled out. I would say in many ways that initial response to the manifesto, the visceral response, both positive and negative, really did feedback on how the book ended up. And I think the book is a more serious approach than what it was initially going to be is a more, I don't want to say moderate approach because there is still some quite strong claims in it. There's still some polemical aspects, but it was a much more considered argument than what we had initially planned. So I think, you know, that sort of initial feedback of hashtag accelerate reflected back on to inventing the future in quite significant ways. And around the same time, you know, the sort of London group of leftists, Aaron Bistani was, you know, someone that we knew through all these different groups and we chatted with him before. And he coined this term fully automated luxury communism. In many ways, it was a sort of influenced by accelerate influence by the same sort of ideas, technologically advanced socialist world. That wasn't afraid of sort of taking what capitalism had built and turning it towards, you know, completely alternative events. See, a fully automated luxury communism, I think, became, started to circulate as part of that. And in many ways, because it included the word communism in it, it ended up having a bit more political valence that accelerated, I think, accelerate very quickly deteriorated into an open question about what is being accelerated. And this is open to so many different interpretations that continues from what I can gather on social media, it continues to be debated today. And precisely to say, all these sort of micro subcultures of hyphenated like, you know, Gothmark, Monarchist or something like that. Literally. Yeah, yeah, yeah, literally. I think very much accelerate has been because of the empty nature of that signifier and what is being accelerated, it's been open to being appropriated by so many different subcultures as well, which is allowed to continue on and multitude of different ways. And I think there's been plenty of sort of fascinating mutations of the term and the idea, along with, you know, many sort of terrifying mutations as well. For sure, for sure. Yeah, I think of, this is maybe an example of how memes and theory have this dialogue between each other because there's this compression of the idea of what is, what is transmittable between person to person to have a kind of scalable political imaginary. So those memes are actually very important, but the memes in the process of compression, they do lose a lot. So this is essentially the balance of politics, which is how to harness the political imaginary, make it transmittable person to person, but also not lose the most important parts of your theory. And as the internet does to theory, as we've learned in the last few years, it can really, really mangle it pretty severely sometimes. Which produces fascinating new strains of stuff, but a lot of them nonsensical to put it generously. I was going to say, though, I think it is a, you know, memes sort of highlight that condensation of ideas and then the sort of creative aspects that can stem from that condensation. But, you know, we might call it sort of a low resolution version of the original ideas. But actually, if you're looking like the history of philosophy or political thinking, in many cases, you know, the most original thinkers are people who mutate it, what somebody else said. And they took that sort of mutation as like the jumping off point for their own project. So I think you know, memes have also done that in their own way. And they have been a jumping off point for a lot of creative, interesting ideas as well. In the first chapter of platform capitalism, you frame the last few decades as the long downturn. And this includes the 70s slump, stagflation, the dot com boom and bust of the 1990s, 2008 as well. And I wonder if now, especially post pandemic, do you feel like we're in a new period of this? That the lockdown is chapter four of the long downturn? It's still a bit open in terms of what's going to emerge from the pandemic. If we ever emerge from the pandemic properly, you know, it very well could become endemic and just continue on in some form or another for a while. I think what's interesting is that if this had happened in 2008 or earlier, you know, the sort of the period where it was supposed to be the end of history, capitalism and one, there was no alternative, free market ideology ran everywhere. I think the response to COVID would have been very different than what we saw in 2020, 2021. You know, the sort of strong state intervention and not just to support banks and large capitalist institutions, but also to support workers in many ways here in the UK, Boris Johnson going and spending money to, you know, have workers not have to go into work. I think there's been a significant shift from that sort of austerity period of 2010s and the neoliberal period of the 90s and 2000s. So there is this aspect where the state is intervening in a way that hasn't for quite a while. That could offer some sort of short-term reprieve from the long-term, I think. You know, there is, I think, a strong argument to be made that state intervention and done in the proper way can actually, you know, jumpstart a capitalist economy in ways that it hasn't for a very long time. And if you look at that sort of period after World War II up to about the 1970s, some called Golden Age of Capitalism, again, that was a period where states were heavily intervening within the economies, industrial policies everywhere, national control over key industries. So all of that, I think, you know, was a period where states were supporting the economy and you had decent economic growth. That could be happening now. I'm somewhat skeptical that it's going to continue for long. I think if you sort of look internally within, to give the examples I know best, the UK economy and the US economy, if you look internally within the class fractions of like the Tory party here in the UK or the class fractions of the Democratic Party, let alone the Republican Party in the US, I think it's not clear that the sort of Keynesian stimulus investment group is necessarily going to continue winning the arguments in the coming years. In which case, the long downturn, I think, will continue pace. You know, I see no reason why the fundamental drivers of it are going to be changing, which, you know, nowadays has to do with productivity growth largely, the lack of productivity growth, the fact that, you know, we may have all these new handheld devices in our pockets, but actually they're not improving the economy in any measurable way. So I think, you know, at the long downturn, if I had to guess, I think it's likely to continue, but come of it is sort of, you know, opened a few doors that weren't there a while ago. Incapsulated in Boris Johnson's statement that there is such a thing as society, I remember that clip, what is it a year ago or so circulating quite a bit? We've been focusing on neoliberalism looking at David Harvey's text from 2007. My general feeling is that we are somewhat on the other side of this, where these things are ripe to be re-evaluated. Potentially in the future, there is a consensus that the hand of the state and intervention and shaping markets, derisking innovation, these types of things will be reconsidered, but there is also a necessary political battle that has to be won. So it's not just going to happen on its own. I mean, I think, I think as well to bring it back to platform Kaplanson, because the Kaplan's class is not unified. There are different fractions of Kaplan's class. And what's interesting when you look at the new deal period in America, for instance, this massive influx of new policies to ostensibly support workers and support the economy, that was because of particular class fraction actually needed workers to be healthy and needed workers to be able to do their job. What I think you see happening now, arguably, and this is where platform Kaplanson comes in, is the platform Kaplanson are quite in favor of that exact sort of thing. They want highly educated workers, they want healthy workers, they want open immigration, they want particular series of things that align with leftist ideas as well, but they don't want it for leftist ends, they want it so that they have this big, malleable workforce that they can use to then dominate the rest of the world. In addition to that, and I don't know if we'll talk about this later enough, but there's the geopolitical aspect, which I think is really interesting for platform Kaplanson. At the moment, the US and China are facing off, trying to carve up the rest of the world according to their tech monopolies, and Europe is looking on, being like, we want a piece of the global platform Pi as well. What this is leading to is massive state intervention and industrial policy everywhere, particularly in light of the global supply chain crisis that we see right now, semiconductors trying to find a PlayStation 5, nearly impossible right now because of these supply chain crises. That means the countries are now trying to take what was once done in Taiwan, now bring it back into domestic control, industrial policies. There is, I think, in terms of the platform economy, there is a real push towards these more sort of Keynesian approaches, which again, we're trying to figure what's going on at the upper echelons of power. I think that's important to recognize. I see, that's, I was going to bring it up later, but I think it's so multifaceted, you kind of can't stay in just one lane to talk about it. Okay, so yeah, there's the economic question, there's the political question, there's also super power competition, and let's say there's a class fracture within American capitalists, right? What made neoliberalism so successful is that there was class solidarity among capitalists, but now there are real fractures, different people need, let's say they want to reshore industry, someone to offshore it, different interests causing these fractures. Alongside competition with China, there's going to be a necessary belt tightening among some bloated sectors of the American capitalist class. Say, for example, we spend twice per person that any other developed country spends on healthcare, maybe Bob who owns all of the healthcare industry in the US could stand with a little bit of belt tightening because that's going to benefit all of the other capitalists so that we can maintain competition with China. So there's various competing forces and politics, economy, super power competition, all of these things drive a reintroduction of the state into politics, shaping markets, playing a larger hand in society. I feel like I don't want to lose track of this question as we move forward. We passed a critical threshold, it was about five years ago, you gave a talk at ours industrialists, and you said something I'm paraphrasing here that within five years these platform services, meaning in that case Uber and Airbnb, will have to transition to luxury services. And here we are, and they've just pretty much made that transition. Do you feel like that description of the gig economy is in a different category than platform capitalism in general, or is that a broader indication for a trend that's about to be rolled out across all of them? Part of the reason I wrote platform capitalism was simply because I was reading about platforms and the digital economy at the time and couldn't make heads or tails of what platforms are supposed to be, just because it seems like at the time so many people had so many different concepts and definitions, and there wasn't really any clarity, Uber would be called a platform, but Google was a platform, but clearly they're very different. So I was trying to, the book was very much an attempt to clarify for myself. It was one of my favorite GJ equits, and he's asked about his rating process, and he says well, the idiot that he writes for is himself. And I sort of feel like that's my writing process as well. Platform capitalism was very much an attempt to try and come to terms with what platforms are, but then the distinctions between them, and I think that's really important over the last five years. Because you do have things like Uber and Airbnb and what I call lean platforms in the book, and they're continued to sort of do their thing, but as you say, they can no longer supplement the costs, the way that they once did, increasingly, particularly in Europe, but I think also increasingly in the US, as we'll see over the coming years, the legal loopholes, which allow them to underpay their workers, are disappearing very, very quickly, which means higher costs again for them and higher costs for consumers. You know, it's higher costs, but it's really just a true reflection of what's actually going on. So there's sort of, you know, progressing along these lines, but they continue to be relatively minor in sort of the grand scheme of things. Now, Uber is a very big business, Airbnb is a very big business. They've worth billions and billions. But then you have companies like Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Alibaba, Tencent, all of them are on a completely different level from any other company. You might want to include Apple in there as well, but I'm not really sure that Apple, for a variety of reasons, I'm not sure we should include them. But so I think over the ensuing five years, what we've seen is some of those companies continuing along and doing their thing in their particular narrow industry, but the other ones, particularly with the pandemic, just growing and expanding everywhere. The amount of companies that these other companies are gobbling up is immense. The industries and the sectors of the economy that they're tendrils are going into is spreading all the time. And you know, you mentioned healthcare and the exorbitant costs in America. Amazon and Google are looking at that and thinking, this is a trillion dollar pie that we could carve up and take a big chunk of. This is what these companies are doing. And I think the pandemic has only accelerated all of that because we've become so dependent on virtual networks for communication, for the economy, for society in general, our dependency on these platforms is grown significantly. If I was to write platform capitalism today, I'd probably care less about Uber and Airbnb and the company. It was, you know, this moment in 2015 era where it was like the sharing economy. That was the big buzz term. And so that was included in the book because everybody was talking about the sharing economy. But really platform capitalism today is maybe six companies globally that are really crucially important. A platform is a very abstract thing to try and define. When you talk about the sharing economy, Uber, Airbnb, etc. It makes it very graspable. People can kind of understand this thing quite easily. But I think there was also an expectation at the time that those, that kind of economic arrangement for lack of a better term was more scalable than it actually was. There's an important study from the Bureau of Labor Statistics that comes out 2018. There's an expected 10% growth in the gig economy. And in fact, it shrinks by 3%. It turned out that people quit driving for Uber and went back working for Walmart. And so when we talk about platform capitalism today, we're really talking about Google and Facebook and these massive, massive entities. I feel that platforms are as difficult to describe as neoliberalism in so far as software can be ideological. Google and Facebook may be neoliberalism, instantiated in code, in the way that people compare Bitcoin to being an arco-capitalism or we chat as state capitalism. Yeah, but looking at, say for example, Harvey's definition of neoliberalism, that these are more or less invisible institutions, massive, but receding into the background, not immediately visible. They attempt to move human interaction, all social interaction into the domain of the market. That sounds diagrammatically very similar to a platform to me. That sounds like Google and it sounds like Facebook. What's interesting in part about platforms, this goes back to your earlier point as well about potential planning possibilities, is that in many ways, neoliberalism is about building markets. This is what I take it to be. Neoliberalism is fundamentally about building markets in every possible area, which is different from classical neoliberalism. This is why it's neoliberalism, is that it doesn't just say that the state steps back in the markets suddenly emerge. Instead it says, well, actually, markets are their institutions, their sets of rules and laws, and they have to be built. They have to be built by the state. You look at carbon markets or fantastic example. There's no natural market for carbon. Instead you have exhaustive processes to build a market in that area. That's neoliberalism. It's to say we're going to use the state not to wither it away, but actually to use it to build markets and support markets. What's interesting about platform capitalism is that in many ways, Amazon, Uber, Google, Facebook, they are the market. They're not to not building the market in the same sense, but they simply are the market in a rather unique way. This is where, again, the planning stuff comes through because rather than have basals in his team of capitalist lackeys decide to run that market the way they want, why could we run it democratically? Why couldn't we take some of these basic principles and think about how to run them in a way which was democratic, which was socialist, which was respectful of the necessary labor required to run these things? I think there is a difference for me between neoliberalism and platform capitalism. I think there's not always obvious, but I think there is a conceptual hinge there, even if it's not necessarily all that different in practice yet. Talking about neoliberalism, it seems at this point, at this stage of historical development, very difficult to revert to the capitalism of the 1970s. Post-war embedded liberalism to return to social democracy. Do you still feel that way if we are crossing this threshold where states are beginning to look back at, say, Keynesian policy at the least, but also a more firm present-hand in shaping markets? Is there maybe a synthesis between these two ideas now or a new opportunity that's opened up? I mean, I'm still quite skeptical. I think the post-war moment, that sort of social democratic moment, was historically unique and the conditions which enabled it are not something we should ever want. You know, it was the great depression and the massive destruction it went to in particular. You've got your reduce to rubble, and under those conditions, it's fairly easy to get German manufacturing going, for instance, when German manufacturing has to rebuild everything. And likewise, you've got a situation where the massive cultural imposition and the state-driven drive as well to keep women in the household and put men into factories. That gender defines that to be crucial to the social democratic moment as well. It's easy to give everybody a job when half the population is working from home. Or it's, you know, working from home in unpaid ways. All of these things are historically unique. And then it also goes back to that fundamental issue of productivity. I follow the economist Robert Gordon in this when he talks about, why do we not have productivity growth right now? His sort of argument, his fundamental argument, is that, well, it's the wrong question about why we don't have productivity growth now. The right question is, why do we have productivity growth from the 1920s to the 1970s? And his argument is that there was a series of technologies developed in the decades prior to that, which were one-off periods, telegram, electricity, the railroad, steam engines, things like this, things which made a huge one-off impact on the economy, which improved things just so immensely. However, you measure it, whether it be GDP or living standards or whatever. But that one-off period can't occur again. Or at least, you know, speculatively maybe we can imagine something like it happening, but none of the technologies we've ever invented since have come anywhere near that surge of technologies. You know, we like to think that we live in a period of rapid change in all this technological transformation, but going from like riding horses to riding trains is a crazy guess. You know, that sort of thing. And you know, Gordon is really good in his book, The Rise and Fall of American Growth About This. He looks at, for instance, Air Travel, which the time it takes to travel from one place to another hasn't decreased since about the 1950s, because you start taking into account all the different security clearances and all these different things. And of course, we had the Concord in the 1970s, and that got canceled. And you know, we've actually gone backwards on some technologies. So this sort of period of productivity growth occurred and allowed for massive economic growth in the 1940s to the 1970s, was a one-off thing which doesn't appear likely to ever happen again. So then the question becomes, what do we do with that? And I think that's where fully automated electric commuism comes in. We can talk about that at another point. Yeah, it's funny, because rhetorically that's what the iPhone was supposed to be. This revolutionary technology that was going to have an impact similar to the train in the telegram and what have you. And instead, it seems to have caused even more stagnation than there was before, economic but also cultural. All of these things are of course intertwined. Okay, well let me, I'm trying to think of how to phrase this as a question. There's a thesis that is floating on maybe the populist left and the populist right that especially after the pandemic that there may be some necessary reshoring of key industries and that this would reverse one part of the trend of globalization. So I wonder if, and I say that say for example, compounded with the unaffordable childcare costs in the US where record numbers of people are quitting their jobs because they simply it's cheaper to stay home and care for your kids than it is to pay to send them to some private school. We may be on the threshold of reinventing some of those conditions that allowed for the capitalism of the 1970s. Now, it may be weird, contorted, undesirable way. Can I ask you about re-industrialization? Does that thesis sit comfortably with you? Do you think it is one possible? Do you think it is too necessary? Is that a populist pipe dream that is not going to be actualized? I do think it's entirely possible from what I've seen of the data so far, it hasn't happened yet. So global trade is still sort of clipping along at the same level it has been. It's not seen the sort of surge in growth that's on the 90s and 2000s but it's continued clipping along at a decent pace. So it hasn't necessarily decreased, reshoring hasn't necessarily happened yet but there's clearly a lot of political interest in it and economic interest in it. Part of the challenge is that in many cases, you can't just build a factory somewhere, suddenly reorganize an entire supply chain around it. The supply chain is connected in so many different ways. And actually, if you look at the academic study of this stuff, it was called supply chains for a long time. And the chain has this sort of image of being a linear process of step by step by step. Nowadays academics will talk about global value networks. And networks, I think, gets to this point that actually it's not linear in any easy way that parts are being sent all over the place and then they're being recombined into various ways and then those are going off into other places to be combined with other sort of metaphors. And eventually you have this finished product. But it's extremely complex and you have to start thinking about how much does a shipping container cost at the present moment? How does that factor into your economic decisions about where you're going to place a factory or anything like that? On top of that, the most sort of, I think, strategically interesting industries like semiconductors, they don't get built overnight. So building a fabrication place to build these things is incredibly expensive. We're talking billions and they take years and years to build. So we look right now and we say, OK, we've got not enough semiconductors. So we're going to build semiconductors factories. And suddenly, five years down the road, we've got all these semiconductor factories that are, they don't have the demand and suddenly we've got an oversupply semiconductors. So you've got a sort of oscillation in that timeline between actually what do you want to do and then actually building it and then having the impacts of it. So I think, you know, re-showing is very, very complicated. The other issue is that there has been re-showing occurring over the past 10, 15 years. The garment industry is a really interesting one. So you know, garments were outsourced to places like Bangladesh, China, and elsewhere. Because labor was so extremely cheap there. It's been brought back in certain places, particularly with the rise of things like fast fashion. You've got garment industry rising in the UK and in the US, but it's coming back in a form which is mostly automated. This is, you know, the owners of capital able to make a nice, tidy profit off of it, but they're not bringing jobs with them. You know, the sort of manufacturing jobs that were lost in the 60s and 70s later on, those aren't going to come back because what's coming back is in an automated form. Now that's not to say I think it's all a bad idea. I think there are obviously these complications, but I think there's also good socialist reasons to, you know, want to push re-shoring. Once you get rid of any sort of nationalist discourse around justifying the re-shoring, but we can also think about, well, long supply chains are generally, not always, but generally bad for the environment. So actually, shorting up supply chains is probably a good thing. The other thing is that the main reason why supply chains became global was because labor was cheaper elsewhere in the world. In an ideal world where, let's say, the living wage was the same everywhere, or, you know, people didn't have to work for a living that'd be even more ideal. But in a case where there wasn't a sort of wage differentials between different countries, in that case, there would be no economic reason to have these long supply chains either. They only exist to take advantage of wage differentials around the world. So I think for, you know, socialist reasons, we can also be arguing for, let's say, a more rational organization of supply chains. I don't think we can get rid of them, not if we want to maintain any semblance of modern life whatsoever. And, you know, there are efficiencies that I think we would want to keep regardless of what society we live under. But there are much more socialist ways of organizing these things. And I think re-shoring will probably be part of that in many ways. One of the inflection points that we've seen in the last two years of the pandemic relates to something you called folk politics. A lot of people discovered that there was really no level of mutual aid that could outcompete or fill the void left by a supply chain that disappeared overnight. And that some of these solutions are going to have to be rather comprehensive in their scope, in their planning. And this, I think, relates to a larger level of state organization and a general turn in left-wing politics away from the folk political, as you describe it. I'm wondering if you sense a similar thing. Do you think that left-wing politics has gotten more or less folk political in the last few years? Yeah, definitely less folk political. By folk politics, we, at the most abstract level, understood it as a sort of politics of immediacy. It was a politics which was focused on changing things at a local level. It was focused on temporally limited interventions, the momentary uprising of an occupied movement and these sorts of things. Which aren't occupied Wall Street was never meant to be a permanent fixture. It was meant to be a temporary thing drawing attention to issues of inequality and ostensibly creating a community that could go and build something different. But yes, if a politics is all about this immediacy, and I think, you know, for us, the real issue, and this is, again, it was Alex and Mark and I were talking about this a lot. It was basically just a question of why did occupied Wall Street fail so badly? You know, despite the greatest crisis in capitalism since the Great Depression, despite millions of people coming out, you know, why did the left make so absolute impact? So yeah, folk politics is sort of an answer to that. It was to say that what the dominant ideas of doing politics at the time, primarily based around horizontalism, just weren't going to be able to change these abstract and global structures. They were going to inevitably sort of be insufficient. So, I think, over the past decade, actually, it's not just the last few years, but the past decade, you have seen a move away from horizontalism. Most obviously you've got pademos, you've got ceriza, you've got Corbin and the labor party, you've got Sanders and the Democratic party. There is a turn towards institutional, more vertical infrastructures. That is a clear change from the 2000s. But of course, what people are running into now is that these institutions are designed to reject any sort of radical change. So, you know, we've run into the limits of them in many, many cases. I think people are now, at least in my experience, you know, the group of people that I'm close with politically and have gone through the Iraq war movement, the Iraq war movement, the Occupy movement, that sort of turned towards parties over the 2010s. They're now much more, let's say, pluralistic about what we do. It's a matter of sort of like making interventions where it's possible, and that could be, you know, big interventions in terms of a political party, but it also could be minor things, you know, building a tendency in it in your community and that sort of thing. And that sort of pluralism is, I think, probably, when I can gather, I think, I think that probably, when I can gather, it's fairly common nowadays. I think fewer people are like devoted to a particular political party. Of course, those people still exist, but I think as a proportion, there are fewer people. And I know hardly anybody who sort of wed it to like a horizontalist approach anymore. I say, you know, there is a lot of different actions and just trying to, you know, find out what works in any particular moment. I will say as well, Rodrigo Nunes is, I think, the best theorist of this stuff as well. So he's written a book that came out recently, but basically thinking about, you know, beyond this sort of horizontal versus hierarchical divide, you know, how do we think about organizations in a way which is much more interesting and hybrid and reflective of what people are actually doing in practice? One of my favorite points about his work is his argument against in the 2000s, a very common argument that we want no leaders. And actually what we don't want is the absence of leaders because then nothing happens, but we also don't want a single leader. What we really want is the possibility for multiple different groups and people and individuals and organizations to take up leadership rules when it's possible. You know, I think he calls it at one point a sort of mobile vanguardism, which I think is a really interesting point that there's not one designated vanguard to lead the revolution, but actually a particular point in time and a particular historical conjunctures, different groups and different organizations and different individuals even can become a vanguard in lead movement. And I think that's probably, you know, the best we can do at the moment. It feels like forever ago. These are now very familiar conversations to us, but I think there are probably young people in the audience that this is maybe their first time hearing it. During the era of Occupy Wall Street, these were very fiercely contested ideas. And in some factions of left wing thought they still are contested. But there was a point where a certain type of left wing, really radical horizontality, seemed to inadvertently, unbeknownst to a lot of the participants, total line for the interest of the platforms in that if you could dismantle a left wing movement and atomize everyone into individual participants on Twitter, for example, that this was in some, in my opinion, goofy, factions of left wing thought that this was actually more desirable than having a hierarchical or organized party or something like this. That no longer seems to be the case. And what I tell participants in the community and students or people who read the syllabus is that if you're spending a lot of time in the newsfeed and you're scrolling Twitter and you're kind of hanging on every update for a story that's in the news cycle, you are really missing the picture. And what you should have is like a collection of maybe six really good books that tell you the story of the past 40 years. And so you understand what neoliberalism is, you understand what platform capitalism is. And then you can kind of just check out of a lot of the newsfeed because it's really just wasting your time. You're just on a treadmill and you're not going anywhere. And what you need is a good analysis from the beginning. And that sets you in the right direction. And then you're equipped to understand the things that come your way. And you can kind of check out of a lot of the newsfeed that just soaks up your time, but doesn't teach you very much. I'm going to shift gears for a second here. This is a rather abstract question. So bear with me for a second here. You mention a pile of money that tech companies are sitting on in Dublin. Some estimates 1.1, 1.3 trillion. This is years ago now, so I imagine it's just comprehensively much larger at this point. One of the things that I'm very curious about, the robber barons of the past of an earlier era of American history and definitely of European history as well, people who sat on that amount of capital would find something to do with it where they would make a beautiful, expansive public library. That was open to everyone. Or they'd found an art museum or something like this that just broadly enriched the public interest. But instead, there's what I would call the platform capitalist class seems to be sitting on an extraordinary amount of money without any desire to give back. And I have my own ideas about why that is. I'm curious if you have any insight and then maybe I'll offer my thesis. I don't want to color your interpretation to see if you have a different opinion. Yeah, it's an interesting question. So the cash glut, as it's known, is sort of the confluence of a number of different things. Primarily, the fact that these companies are so based upon intellectual property for a lot of their potential revenues. An intellectual property, because it's immaterial, you can just locate it wherever you want. And these companies basically just write a piece of paper saying, oh, well, we've moved it to this tax haven. So then the profits that get accumulated on these particular intellectual properties end up getting charged at various rates. Now in the US, it was also partly the fact that what's known as the repatriation of profits. So taking profits earned abroad and bringing it back to America, the tax on that was, I think it was 30 or 35 percent. It was very, very high. So these companies are basically like, well, we're not going to bring it back to America because we're going to have to give away a good chunk of it. So it was kept abroad in these tax havens. And you know, it's interesting as well, what different companies do with it? Because Apple basically uses a lot of it to give away dividends. You know, they give their stockholders get to nice payment all the time. They're increasingly buying back stock as well, which means that as the supply of stock goes down, stock prices go up. Looks good on the bottom line. Looks good for anybody who's still holding stock because your prices are going up. But that's, you know, that's what they were using a lot of their financial heft for. Whereas a company like Amazon is sort of the exact opposite. Amazon I find, you know, beautiful in a horrifying way because they are like the archcap list, I think. They are the company which says, no, we're not going to take any profits and give it a stockholders. We're going to reinvest it so we can grow bigger and more powerful. And that's what terrifies me about Amazon is that they know exactly what they're doing. Whereas Apple's just like, we don't know what to do with our money. We have too much. Yeah, and then it gets to, as you say, the issue, you know, well, why aren't you doing the sort of public outreach charitable things? I mean, partly it has to do with the financial structure of these companies. So particularly like Facebook is a good example where Zuckerberg has set it up in such a way that he continues to control it. And, you know, it's dominated by him. He does then go and spend money on charities and tries to make a good name for himself. And I have this, I have this inkling that he really does think he's doing the world a favor with like metaverse and stuff like that. I think he really thinks that like this is his investment in improving the world. That's the contemporary expression of that classic robber baron buying libraries is Zuckerberg creating a virtual library on metaverse. I was going to say as well, you got you got Bayzos and stuff like that. But reportedly Amazon Prime is a money, money loser for them. And one of the key reasons why Bayzos continues to spend money on Amazon Prime is reportedly because you want to get close to Hollywood and you know, be next to the fancy actresses and everything like that. You know, it's just a way for him to pick up. Yeah. Yeah. I guess this is an ill society. Totally is. One other thing though, which is interesting is you've also got the space race from a lot of these wealthy people as well. So Branson, Bayzos and Elon Musk, that fucker. Yeah. So you've got these three basically using their private wealth, not to buy libraries, but to build giant space penises and go into lower orbit. The space stuff is, part of their wager is that carbon is going to burn up the planet in the imminent future. And so rather than giving back and making a library or an art museum, I'm building the necessary infrastructure to preserve humanity or something like that, which is, I don't know, maybe admirable in a very limited sense, but I would personally much rather save the planet and survive. That's just me. But I wondered, there's, tell me if I'm missing the mark here. I feel like there's also an ideological component where specifically platforms like YouTube and platforms like Facebook, they were creating an outlet that gave everyone a voice. And so for them, there would be a conflict of actually making an art museum that elevated one level of cultural production or one object above all others because they were creating the horizontal platforms that allowed everyone to be an artist. So it was actually antithetical to their process of how they understood and wanted to shape society to allow for editors and curators and etc. Because what they were trying to do was disintermediate and break up those old legacy media institutions. And now we kind of see they're having to eat their words to a certain degree because once the gatekeepers were eliminated from these platforms and eliminated from media, it's been really disastrous for the discourse. Like it has gotten, I think, measurably by all indications worse. And certainly to the detriment of a lot of these platforms. That is maybe a more narrow analysis that applies specifically to the art world, but in the broad analysis of just global capitalism more generally, declining rates of profit, no states to de-risk innovation. And then you end up with tech money that should be used in venture capital in some way, but they just can't find anything profitable enough to put it in. And it just sits in Dublin and it doesn't move, which is dangerous because capital needs to circulate otherwise you get a crisis. Yeah, but maybe in the near future, things go our way a little bit, then states can facilitate this capital moving again and you can get maybe a little bit more intervention and shaping of markets. You recently had a piece in E-Flox written in collaboration with Helen Hester titled Shelter Against Communism. And this is about the role of home ownership, specifically in the suburbs, in propagating capitalist ideology, capitalist individualism. You also have a book coming out this year. I wonder if you would tell us maybe a bit about the book and how that recent essay relates to the topics and the themes you're looking at now. Helen and I writing a book called After Work, The Fight for Free Time. We're hoping to finish it up in the next month or two. We're very nearly done. But basically the core sort of jumping off point for the book is to say, well, we've got all this sort of thinking about post work recently over the past five, ten years. You know, lots of people thinking about, well, how do we end work? You know, what are the ways to get there? What can we do afterwards? But then you've also got a sort of curious absence in a lot of that discussion, which is the work that's done in the home. You know, we talk about, let's automate factories, let's automate office work, let's automate warehouses. But we don't talk about domestic work in the home. And we also don't talk about, you know, hospitals or nurseries or nursing homes or anything like that. The work of social reproduction, you know, the work that goes into caring for people, supporting people daily, but also reproducing, you know, the species over generations. All of the work that goes into that sort of social reproduction has largely been missed by post work. And when you do find people talking about it, it's mostly to say that actually post work can't really apply to social reproduction. So you know, the classic idea of post work, you know, simplest version is to say, well, we have this work which needs to be done. Let's automate it with a rope up and then we can have free time. With social reproduction, you can't really do that either technically, economically or morally, in many cases. You can't automate childcare in the same way. You can't automate elder care in the same way. We can't automate gestational labor in the same sort of way. And so it seems like, you know, there's this huge amount of work, social reproduction, and the discourse around post work, it just seems like they can't speak to each other. Our book is basically an attempt to say that they can speak to each other, but they both have to be revised in sort of particular ways to think about it. So it goes through, you know, history of different approaches to post work on social reproduction, and we're focusing on four different areas. Families, so the sort of social unit which takes care of ideological reproduction, daily care in general, technologies, so various technologies which could be potentially used to assist with reproductive labor, standards. So there's a really interesting story to be told about the increase in, for instance, cleaning standards over the past century, but also childcare standards. You know, weirdly enough, every single statistic we have shows that we spend more time on children today than we did in the 1970s. And that was when you had a full-time housewife. So there's this weird case where standards have risen up, and you know, we're now doing more work because the standards have risen. And then lastly, we have spaces, so the different spaces of social reproduction. And this is where the shelter against communism piece came from, is this sort of building off of some of the pieces from that chapter. So looking at the various ways in which alternatives to the individualized family home have been created, but also failed, so why they didn't manage to actually reduce work. But also why that particular household form, again, the individualized single family home, idealized in suburbia, how that was imposed after World War II, and why that was imposed. And I think there's a really interesting anti-communist story to be told about suburbs, which is, you know, this quote from one of the biggest developers in the 1950s, who basically said no man who owns his own home can be a communist because he has too much work to do. It's a perfect encapsulation of everything. But yeah, it's, you know, this really interesting point about how individualized family homes and home ownership that goes along with it were designed in such a way that they reduced people's free time so that they wouldn't become communists. And then also how that gets extended internationally because the US was quite forceful in pushing out a particular ideology around home ownership. Yeah, so we try and tell some of these stories in this book. And then, you know, in the concluding chapter we try and set out, well, what can we learn from these stories about how to combine post-work associated production, recognizing previous limitations and problems and issues? There are certain privileges in the art world that when we discuss politics broadly, we are not bound by other professional disciplines and we can be in some ways untethered to the current moment. We can be very speculative. As the crisis, unfortunately, deepens, more and more radical solutions are required. Greater imaginaries, greater scope and a more radical vision. Yeah. And so when I think of your work, I think of Helen's work, I think of the things that have been most influential for me in the past few years. We're looking at a future where there's going to be a level of social planning and smart cities and a green TVA smart grid that will require a level of social organization that just hasn't happened in my lifetime, certainly. But I don't think during the neoliberal era at all. So this level of maybe speculative utopian design is actually becoming not speculative, but very urgent and necessary. So it's an interesting, hopeful, but also terrifying time. So yeah, Nick, thank you so much. This has been a pleasure talking to you. Is there anything else to plug before we sign off here? Go out and build communism. Three things here to make, kings fun.",

      "text": "I first published Polydagram in the post-left as a short-run artist book in September of 2018. Approximately 55 copies were sold over direct message and email. In the years leading up to its publication, I realized that few, if any of my peers or studio visitors were familiar with the content and communities I was exploring. The original version of the book included a working journal of my art and life surrounding the project, writings on earlier work, anecdotes about travel and in-progress images. The essay was intended to be a handbook for artists who were curious about these online spaces but unsure where to start. I chose to print this material as a way to restrict the circulation to its target audience only. One copy was available at Codex Books in the NYC East Village. Sometime during mid-October, a Polydagram user visited the store and purchased the book along with several of their texts related to left political theory. The essay was scanned and uploaded to Discord. It circulated quickly. When I first wrote the essay, I assumed it would be one of a dozen similar projects to be published that year. At the time, there was a great interest in these topics and I thought that I was just quick to respond. Now, several years later, there is still nothing else quite like it. I've chosen to republish the text with only very minor edits in order to preserve it as a record of its time. If I had written it today, I might have made different choices. Publishing the essay, following the spread of research and encountering these unique and talented young people, transformed my practice and understanding of the world in ways that I could not have been prepared for. Record Scratch, Freeze Frame, yep, that's me. You're probably wondering how I ended up in this situation. It all goes back to some early studio visits in 2012. I remember telling people that much of the internet's viral content was made by young teenagers. This was usually met by strange looks and disbelief. Just a few years later, this idea seemed so common place, it's almost not worth mentioning. As part of the artist's collaborative jogging, I got to see this play out in real time on Tumblr. I would routinely encounter original content, OC accounts, run by pseudonomous tweens. Their viral images would reach audiences numbered in the millions. As an amateur anthropologist of internet culture, I've always made it a point to follow these accounts. As is the case for most visual artists, my primary social media platform was Instagram. My feed was an intermingling of the conventional art world and OC producers on the long tail of improbable subcultures, which thrive in the niche-ified environment of the internet. Among these accounts was a group of libertarian teenagers whose online activity began to rapidly heat up in 2015 alongside the American primary races. This particular community had an odd set of political ideals. Mostly intent on shitposting ironic or trollish content, they were self-described an argo capitalist. These kids were obsessed with various philosophies centered around property rights. Everything in the world had to be analyzed for the principles of non-aggression and homesteading. They would describe capitalism as, quote, a highly ethical system of voluntary transactions between mutually consenting parties. From their perspective, the true source of tyranny and oppression throughout history was the monopoly power of governments. Now don't let the capitalism part throw you off just yet. While they were deeply right-wing in their property views, they were also radical individualists and subsequently pro-diversity. The meme goes something like this. I want gay-married couples to protect their marijuana plants with unregistered firearms they bought with Bitcoin. They are anti-state and pro-freedom. Any disparaging generalization about a group was seen as an attack on the rights and character of those members as individuals. These kids would constantly battle mainstream conservatives in the common threads. To the end caps, everyone was a sovereign citizen. The inherent contradictions of their belief system, lack of historical knowledge, and clear desire to evangelize for civil liberties made this a fascinating and mostly harmless subculture to observe. This began to change in 2015. The presidential primaries are a generally divisive process for the United States. They ravaged social media in the form of endless Facebook threads and Twitter wars. For young ideologues, it sets off a dramatic chain of events that culture and media experts are still struggling to explain. In the end cap communities, these previously anti-hierarchical anarchists soon gravitate towards highly authoritarian ideas. Social media overflows with memes featuring libertarian thinker Hans Hermann Hoppe and dictator Augusto Pinochet. The desire for a society of civil law soon morphs into civic nationalism and ultimately into ethno-nationalism. The elaborate Rube Goldberg machine of avoiding contradictions in their own belief system is truly astounding to watch. In the mainstream media, this group becomes popularly known as the alt-right. Like most people at the time, I did not take this group seriously. I considered them to be just another anomaly in the cultural atomization brought about through the internet. I soon learned that these users are enmeshed in a much larger and highly active community called Politigram. This is exactly what it sounds like, political radicals on Instagram. In my experience, the demographic composition here is mostly young white males between the ages of 12 and 17, with some notable exceptions. Similar communities exist on Reddit, 4chan, and Tumblr, and just about every other platform. Instagram seems to skew the youngest of them all. Every political ideology you can think of is thriving and meaming on Politigram. While the far-rights impact on social media and public debate is more visible, there exists a great diversity of opinion in these spaces, which remains largely unexplored. At a time when the rest of social media had gathered into ideologically quarantined filter bubbles, Politigrammers were intentionally following their political opponents. These kids would constantly troll each other at all hours, the hosted video debates on YouTube and later Instagram live. In these circles, there is no greater cache than to embarrass your opponent through skilled argument. Slut for DPRK annihilates hox versus the revisionist and an epic common thread that is screen-shotted and regrammed throughout the whole community. For all their deep ideological disagreements, there is a remarkable camaraderie amongst the members. Virginia for Bernie can comment LOL on a post by Gecko versus the state, even though they are diametrically opposed in their political beliefs. As Politigram grew in size, various accounts emerged to organize events for the community, debates, model UN, and live stream interviews. Several accounts began to report on the community itself, relaying news about account admins, stirring up drama between users, and distributing screenshots of the all-time best comment burns. Politigrammers revel in adding as many prefixes and suffixes to their ideology as possible. As I think there are as many ideologies as there are members of Politigram, some of the more unusual titles have come across, National Trotskyism, Darmic Eco-Reactionaryism, Libertarian Neomonarchism, Traditional Primitivist Caliphatism, Christian Bolshevism, and many more. Similar to the identity politics culture of Tumblr, these spaces are deeply individuated and users often list their relevant info at the header of their page.

The individuated style of these profiles implies a latent anti-collectivism within the culture and the platform itself. We might ask what use is a political party of want? This is a topic for a whole other project. At the time, my interest in exploring this space is to find an online left that can compete with the social media impact of the alt-right. It seemed obvious that after the ubiquity of social media, any progressive political movement would require some degree of a popular space. This space would need its own department of outreach, the memeers, influencers, and online personalities that work to prime new followers for radicalization. The far right did this extraordinarily well leading up to the 2016 presidential election. My practice became an extensive research project into the underbelly of online radical groups. I would find the counter-movement, prognosticate its rise, and turn the tide of American politics. Or so I hoped. In a strange way, Instagram feels like the old internet of portal links. The interface is clunky and filled with cumbersome click-throughs. There is no easy way to use quantitative data or scrape analytics in this closed system. Politigram can't be visualized from the outside. It must be explored qualitatively from within. Search results yield mainstream meme accounts, paid posts, and merch stores ready to monetize their followings. Accounts which have been featured in the mainstream media or have too many followers are generally not trusted. They're normies. Even like Facebook, Instagram users do not mutually subscribe to each other's posts when connecting. In a one-way subscriber system, word of mouth has a high value. A shout out from a more popular account can be a powerful endorsement. Otherwise, sifting through the common threads is usually the best way to uncover the core accounts and OC tastemakers within the community. Politigram is a haven for both ideologues and trolls. They are interested in experimenting and trying on new world views. Remember, these are mostly kids in middle school and high school. Some users manage different accounts, aligned with different ideologies. Users often evolved in their views, deleted all their content, changed their name, and started fresh. Many Politigrammers will periodically take various political compass tests and update their followers about how their views are evolving. This type of post is most commonly referred to as my political journey. Think of it as a viral personality quiz for political extremists. Users will discuss where they started and where they think they might be headed. While these quizzes are certainly reductive, they do seem to be relatively accurate in that members of closely affiliated groups score reasonably close to each other on a consistent basis. Screenshot from summer 2017. My political journey. April 2016. June 2016. September 2016. November 2016. February 2017. July 2017. Without psychologizing these users too much, there is most definitely a profile that applies to many of the edglered teens. I try to keep in mind that these kids are products of their environments. They are shaped by cultural and economic forces beyond their immediate control. From their few and infrequent earnest personal posts often deleted within minutes, one quickly learns that many of them struggle with depression, social isolation, family problems, and trouble at school. For social outcasts, the temptation to troll the real world and so political chaos can often be overwhelming. At the same time, it is hard to have sympathy for anyone who openly advocates violence against others. My rules for this research were to follow, but not to interact, and to report any credible threat of real world violence. A full ethnography of a politician is a project for someone with much more experience than me. These spaces bleed into nearly infinite subcultures. I sat down to write this essay because I was inspired by the story of a specific group of online left anarchist teens whose political evolution is outlined in some detail in the latter portion of this book. I think their story might offer us some insight towards the formation of young radicals under our current media paradigm. It might tell us something about what is happening in the minds of young American male contents. This particular group began a self-described syndiculus, socialists, or otherwise lefties. Over the course of three years, they evolved into something much darker. These platform spaces accelerate radicalization in unprecedented ways. The role of memes in 2016 is a phenomena whose aesthetic significance cannot be overemphasized. To be clear, memes did not win the election for Republicans. Still, the appearance of memes on mainstream media and numerous posts by members of the administration and first family are all evidence that these images are not going unappreciated. If you were to describe the 2016 meme war, absent a political ideology, it might sound structurally similar to some of the reasons my generation of artists first got involved with art and social media. Consider a mass, leaderless online movement, organized around open source digital images, which create cultural agitations and contribute to a major shift in public discourse at a volatile time in history. It sounds a bit like some naive California ideology, but certainly those aspirations align with the more techno-yotopian hopes that myself and many of my peers shared when we first started getting involved with art online. As young artists, we thought that social media was going to liberate culture and society in general. Many to many networks would rid us of the corrupt gatekeepers and institutions. The artist would be set free. LMAO, we quickly learned how flawed that strategy was. Now all of social media has learned it too. While it would be a mistake to assume that all political accounts are honest narrators, communicate their politics in good faith, or are aware of their underlying motivations, it is extremely clear that among them exist users with earnest and strongly held ideological convictions. As time goes on and the barriers to entry increase, the ratio of ideologues to trolls goes up. To be fair, I do not want to oversell the level of discourse going on in these communities. Part of everything is trolling, and the other part is still the work of mostly ill-informed angsty teenagers. What I found most curious is that in a moment where mainstream political debate began to narrow into what is realistically possible within the existing system, the overtune window for these radical kids grew wider than ever. This window of political possibilities generally shifts left or right in accordance with the cultural forces of the time. Any moment of bidirectional expansion is an anomaly worth investigating. As the culture wars many of 2016 accelerated, I took sharp notice of these divergent trends in my newsfeed. Today, the electoral strategy of quote, aiming for the center has been proven to be a failure. No one gets excited to compromise. The level of discourse in these online circles was mediocre at best, but I can't help to wonder if there is something important we might learn from their viral tactics and broad horizon of political possibilities. At the very least, watching their activity might help tip us off to new ideological currents before they hit the mainstream. Transhumanism and the radical right. In Kill Old Normies, Angela Nagel accurately describes the alt-right as, quote, preoccupied with transhumanism. By now, I had watched this community for a couple years and I had seen these techno-elitist aspirations escalate dramatically. Anarcho-transhumanism was a subculture of the ancap and classical liberal spheres. Transhuman trans believed that deregulated capitalism was the most efficient way to achieve their goals. While these accounts would generally post different content, the two groups shared close ideological unity. They would choose to structure a political economy in the same way. I was most familiar with transhumanism from clickbait articles and videos, people putting magnets in their fingertips, miracle brain-enhancing drugs, and vaporware cyborg mods. Transhumanism was just about to be released and would soon transform the world. I had always thought this stuff was pretty kitsch. Some startup is 3D printing prosthetic limbs for amputee orphans whose families were killed in a war extracting resources from the third world. But now we are going to force them to become cyborgs too. These tech solutions are like trying to save a drowning person by bailing buckets of water out of the ocean. Transhumanism was also a popular topic in Lower East Side Art Circles around 2014. I remember people getting into new tropics for a while. It's fun to think about Kurzweil, immortality, wetware, and stem cells. I get it. I'm a sci-fi fan too. So I did the deep dive. Of all the exciting and radical innovations that were just about to change our lives, basically none of them worked. Life extension salesmen spent years hopping from one foundation to another. They would raise funds, yield zero results, and then set up shop under a new name. Researchers have fallen for these scams since the dawn of time. After all, who wants to die? It's good clickbait, but it doesn't take long to figure out that's all it is. You can't wish the Johnny Debt movie into being real, no matter how much money you have. To be fair, most transhumanists see themselves as apolitical sci-fi nerds. The specific group I'm describing is an outgrowth of various right-wing ideologies applied to technology. They worship venture capital. This type of singularitarianism is a near religious conviction. So if the tech doesn't work and transhumanism isn't going to make us immortal, what's the deal? Why does anyone stick around? Well, imagine the movie Gatica, designer babies with an IQ of 200 and the bodies of Olympic athletes. But in this case, it's a society architected by in cells. Humanism flourishes in these online communities as a result of their fixation on human difference. They look to explain social and economic hierarchies as the product of purely biological processes which have no root in history. To them, the current social order is just innate individual ability and niche and will to power. This type of narrative fits comfortably into the worldview of the auto-diedact internet skeptic. The topic of, quote, human biodiversity is largely adopted from the alt-right and works to reinvigorate theories of race and IQ. Transhumanists push these topics of, quote, human improvement to make class an empirical and biological reality. The ultimate objective is to create a master race via technology. When these abstract goals translate into a real political project, there are rather few options. Either a libertarian exit is necessary or democracy must be abolished. They will happily take whichever comes first. I originally wrote this next bit of text as a press release for a show in January of 2018. It makes a decent introduction for the community we are about to explore. Globalization versus the Left. At a moment when globalism sits at the center stage of public debate, extreme positions are moving into the mainstream. These pictures imagine two speculative futures which the internet knows well, and Capastan and Transhumania. Each of these ideologically uncompromising worlds demands radical deregulation and the privatization of nearly all aspects of social life. They are frequently invoked by branches of the libertarian right which view the existence of government in general as either tyranny, bloat, or plain old fashion corruption. Their proposed solutions most often involve creating a dynamic and competitive marketplace for governance. In these systems, citizens vote with their feet by leaving one sovereignty to join another. This manifests as the voluntary secession and breaking a part of larger states into self-organizing patchwork of micro nations. And of course abolishes the federal government, income tax, and most all regulations that get in the way of market efficiency. Contrary to open borders, so long as the border community likes you. On social media, the radical Left had poorly organized and smaller followings compared to the prevalence of high engagement far-right accounts. The Liberals, environmentalists, Demsauks, Cyndaglus, MLs, MLMs, Incomes, Trotskists, Left Combs, fully automated luxury communists, communists, communizers, Pasadis, Maoist Third Worldists, Tankis, etc., etc., and so on all hated each other. The online bright was equally divided, but somehow managed to coordinate cultural agitations that contributed to events which are now reshaping our political reality. As image makers and students of culture, i.e. artists, all of this should be really important to us. We can probably learn a few things. If a 1970s stack is not working for today's internet, then the same goes for the art world. Both spheres are hamstrung by similarly outmoded tactics which bar us from wielding real influence. We remain trapped in the 20th century. After two years searching social media, I have found little evidence towards the online Left Unity for which I had hoped. What I did find were many vibrant and surprisingly active communities of the post-left. Anti-civilization eco-anarchist groups scattered across various chat servers. Their style is witty and cutthroat, radically inclusive, multicultural, LGBTQ, pro-diversity, posting 24 hours a day at the speed of 4chan. Race, class, gender is a social construct and we must do away with all of it. They reject traditional strategies of collective bargaining and coalition building. They conceive of markets as essentially a head of regulation. How can progressivism be progressive if regulation itself is reactionary? Technological progress creates new markets faster than they can be regulated. Civilization means an inevitable drift to the right. Anything other than dismantling civilization is only a temporary stopgap which by design cannot hold back the brutal efficiency of capitalist acceleration. Themes of nihilism are pervasive within this group. Some are self-described cyber nihilists. Many have favorable opinions towards various eco-extremist organizations. Literally teenage delusions scholars who sympathize with Ted Kaczynski. I'm okay with the possibility of dying from a toothache because the true costs of technology means that many others must die or live as slaves. These pictures are exercises in photographing the future. They tell narratives of imminently unfolding dystopias. A micro-partement renter stockpiles dried goods while high-rise dwellers to Uber Chopper from superstar architect buildings across the skyline of a flooded city. An isolation estate, a top of man-made island, imports all of its goods as residents are luxuriously weighted on by automated robot servants. My time studying this space seems to indicate and correspond with a broader trend of young ideologues and activists losing faith in the goals of the old left. Better jobs, higher wages, equality, a government for the people, or generally any meaningful improvement in their material well-being. Our failure to present a compelling vision of the future is currently losing the younger generation to nihilism. For the second year in a row, life expectancy in the United States has dropped. Q the post-left, it has to get worse before it gets worse. Okay, so what is the post-left? These terms are always contested. For me, the best definition goes something like this. Where Mark says that alienation arises with industrial capitalism from wage labor and the commodity form, the post-left would argue that alienation begins even earlier with agrarian societies and labor specialization. They claim that our inability to be self-sufficient has alienated us from our own nature, our environment, and essentially domesticated the human being. Their ideal society is a band of nomadic hunter-gatherers living off the natural abundance of the land. They frequently talk about imminent ecological disaster and the necessity for degrowth. Back in 2015, the post-left is almost nonexistent on Politigram. A narco-primitivism is often the butt of jokes from just about every corner of the community. The few uneironic and prim or green-atterquy accounts that do exist have low engagement and post-infrequently. Animal environmentalism is an essential component of the zeitgeist on Politigram. It is rarely the focal point around which these users orient their politics. At the time, these accounts generally describe themselves as a narco-communist, syndicalist, or socialist. As the 2016 election ignites the whole of American culture, these young radical leftists undergo a curious evolution in their political ideology. At first, many of them rally behind Bernie. While his positions are often described as insufficiently radical and too centralized for their anti-authority leanings, they had a general consensus in their support. No candidate is perfect, but this one will do. When Bernie is ultimately defeated by the Democratic establishment, this group soon finds themselves without a suitable representative. DNC Collusion with Hillary's campaign seems to vindicate many of their long-held anti-state sentiments. All types of centralization are now discredited. Pro-anarchist posting flourishes. When democratic socialism is off the table, these users rapidly lose faith in electoral politics. When Clinton is defeated in the general election, all hell breaks loose online. For the burgeoning post-left of Politigram, this is the final confirmation they need. Post about anti-sitalization and nihilism are now in full swing. It seems like every aspect of society is moving further towards the political right. The collapse is imminent. It's coming sooner than we thought. The irony of being an anti-tech radical on the internet is not lost on these teens. Everyone in today's society lives in constant contradiction of their ideals. In these young corners of the internet, everything is simultaneously ironic and genuine. While they rarely discuss it outright, my general assumption is that their hatred of technology is symptomatic of the times. Teenagers' lives are more permeated by social media than any other demographic. Many of these users fit the profile of the Kekistan forechand type culture, isolated gamers and introverts without strong social ties IRL. Their banter is qualitatively similar in its edginess and rapid pace. Since 2016, politicized all aspects of pop culture and moved much of their demographic towards the right, these users radicalized in the opposite direction. Just a few years earlier, it would have been unimaginable to describe the 2016 Mimosphere and rightward political shift in youth culture. As the Overton window expands, new radical positions enter the mainstream. Young people have the most solues in climate change scenarios. Political collapse is extraordinarily effective in radicalizing Gen Z. The images and chats reproduced here are sourced from a small but highly active community on Politigram. It would be impossible to represent this community in its entirety. I've tried to collect the most meaningful images, comments and captions that may help give you an idea of who these users are and what they believe. Users like post-left communization, eco-anarchy, green-anarchy, anti-civilization, primitivism, left-com, nihilist communism, eco-com, among many others, are used almost interchangeably here. They refuse to collect under a single moniker. John Zerzan is a major figure within this group. Other contemporaries include Freddie Perlman, Derek Jensen, Kevin Tucker, and various writers associated with black and green press, named for the colors of anarcho-primitivism. The most credentialed living scholar discussed within these circles is James C. Scott, a professor in the political science department at Yale University whose work focuses on early agrarian and non-state societies. For many members of this group, the political left becomes a more-loathe enemy than the right. These accounts constantly distance themselves from both liberalism and failed authoritarian regimes. The tantalizing promises of the progressive left serve only to mask the terrible truth every primitivist already knows. The project of civilization itself is corrupt and irreparable. The left stalls the inevitable collapse and only distracts people from the truth. They accomplish nothing while enabling the right to continue its long history of hierarchical oppression. Green Anarchy is the only sustainable society. No one is green-pilled by a single meme. They are turned through constant exposure to these ideas over a long period of time. The political evolution of this group in particular seems to be the product of external political and cultural events combined with a youthful intellectual curiosity. To the best of my knowledge, this space has not been infiltrated by outside ideologues looking to recruit young people as new members. The anti-tech sentiment within the post-left organizations seems to present a curious hurdle for online recruitment tactics. A union of egoists If Stage 1 for this process is the rejection of technology, then Stage 2 is most definitely the adoption of Max Sterner. Sterism is always alive and well in the atomized culture of the internet, but these memes make a special resurgence in 2016. At the time, American culture makes a near-perfect storm for anti-tech ideology and radical individualism to flourish. The failures of the center-left establishment in American politics works to fuel anarchist ideology online. As social media induces depression and isolation, let-ite leanings become more pronounced. Egoism naturally emerges as part of the individuating and alienating processes of neoliberal structures embedded within social media. These are a few typical political style accounts which join in the post-left and Egoist Communism social media upsurge, most began in 2017.

With Sadie Plant in the mid-90s Various art world and art adjacent figures passed through the group Including Mark Fisher, my personal favorite Ray Brassier, Jake and Dinos Chapman, among others Burnt out from a drug-induced mental collapse Which involved taking speed and long binge-writing sessions In the middle of underground jungle raves Land disappeared from public life He resurfaced a few years later In Shanghai As a prominent fascist thinker Land's new theory is the dark enlightenment De is the guiding philosophy for the neo-reactionary movement NRX The high brow and even more radical contingency of the alt-right His new work is largely based on the writings of pseudonymous Silicon Valley blogger Menchus Moldbug AKA Curtis Yarvan Yarvan first gains mainstream media attention When he is protested for speaking at a tech conference In Missouri in 2015 Steve Bannon places the story on Breitbart Covering it as an issue of free speech Yarvan is a friend and political adviser to Peter Teal Who is also the primary investor in his company The web extends ever outward While he was in London One might have characterized Land's work as anarchist In Syrectonary Or possibly nihilistic But certainly anti-capitalist Today he furiously tweets and blogs openly advocating for eugenics and the abolition of democracy Knowing of him mostly through the far right I am surprised to encounter Land's earlier work within the post-left community The type of racism and fascism he now represents Is the complete and polar opposite of their beliefs I guess enough time spent marinating in technonialism Will do strange things to the way you think The post-left enjoys his mania And appreciates the fact that he is a pro-democratic And that he is a pro-democratic And that he is a pro-democratic The left enjoys his mania And appreciates the analogy of capitalism And the death drive Land's theory of hyperstition Is easily retrofitted On to Cerner's concept of property As a phantasm in the mind of the beholder Both thinkers have an interest in occultism Which occasionally makes an appearance in their work I can't pretend to understand Or summarise Land's position The levels of contrarianism run deep beyond trolling He speaks in 20 minute monologues is dismissed by most mainstream institutions, but thrives online. In the case of Politogram, Landian Thought is perfect fuel for anti-establishment teens. In these online communities, the philosophy of accelerationism is split largely into two camps, left and right. R-Ack is associated mostly with land and yarvan. L-Ack describes thinkers like Nick Zernick, Alex Williams, and Paul Mason. Various niche groups have collected around the term U-Ack, unconditional accelerationism, in an attempt to revive popular interest for land's earlier work. All manner of acceleration is agreed with Marx's fundamental idea that technology, at the hands of capital, is the force which shapes human society and moves history forward. This preoccupation with technology often metastasizes into a dark and nihilistic world view. Through what Ray Brassier describes as, quote, delusian machinic practiceism, and what I would call, taking shit literally, land refuses to engage in any theory as abstraction. He attempts to move beyond representation, reject the binaries between objects and concepts, and ultimately render reality itself as a transcendental illusion. This is arguably what drives lands and fetamine-induced schizophrenia. He wants to break the psychological confines of capitalism. For the post-left, these ideas align closely with the anarcho-primitivist desire to live without symbolic culture, and to be fully present in the world without abstraction or social constructs. Within this framework, Ted Kaczynski, the unibomber, quickly emerges as the ideal subject of lived practice. Kaczynski do all the loan, as a self-sufficient primitivist in remote Montana. He wrote prolifically about his ideology and battled with severe schizophrenia. He appears frequently in their images and chats. United Green Alliance Three days after the inauguration, several members of post-left political announced the formation of a new writing collective, the United Green Alliance. The group remains active for over a year. They publish a total of 59 articles, nearly one a week, from a combined total of 13 contributors. They disband in March of 2018. The quality of writing runs a wide range. Some articles feel like repurposed high school social studies papers. Others feel like polished academic theory. The group releases a one episode podcast featuring an interview with John Zerzan. Kind of related, there's a YouTube video from the Stanford Transhumanists where John Zerzan and Zoltan Eastfon, 2016 presidential candidate for the Transhumanist Party, debate on the merits of technology. That link gets shared a lot. Chase that of Instagram. A few months after the election, social media platforms begin to crack down on hate speech more tightly. Broadly speaking, any radical or politically dissident posts are now on the chopping block. Unibomber memes are most definitely not welcome. Many accounts, both large and small, are now set to private for fear of being flagged or deleted. As intended, these policies disrupt the community and cripple their activities. Soon, many Politigrammers retreat to Discord, a platform composed of private chat servers, like Slack for gamers. These servers are highly active around the clock. Discord allows them to mass chat and exchange reading material in a way that Instagram never could. The memes continue, but their focus now shifts towards the text. Radicalization intensifies. Here, I have reproduced screenshots of the typical banter, jokes, community building, and shitposting that characterizes these servers. The level of conversation is sometimes scholarly and sometimes crap. It changes pitch quickly and can be hard to keep up if you're not familiar with the lingo. The particular chat server we focus on was populated by many post-left Politigrammers and UGA members. The server was founded in February of 2017, but really kicks off that summer. Having been chased out of public on Instagram, these users no longer spend time debating with political opponents. Instead, they marinate in ideological quarantine. They become ever more deeply entrenched in their views. Every platform migration thins the herd, but those that remain grow more radicalized than ever. Who are the ITS? This image of mass figures appears in several memes and is frequently posted on Discord. It is one of the few photographs of a Latin-American-based eco-extremist group known at the time as Reaction Selvahe. The group began in Mexico in 2011 and has since spread throughout the region. Today, these dissident groups have banded together under the name Individualidades, Tendiendo, Alos Selvahe, translated to English as individuals tending towards the wild. The group remains active as recent as last year. They are highly secretive, not frequently reported on, and have made few public statements. ITS is many shades beyond the organized property destruction brand of eco-terrorism we are familiar with here in the United States. Keep in mind, when the Earth Liberation Front was at its most active, many of these Politigram users had not yet been born. ITS is responsible for numerous attacks and several deaths within Latin America over the past few years. The group is so radical they were publicly denounced by Ted Kaczynski last year. In their 2014 communique, ITS writes, The researchers will be burned along with their scientists. The businesses that promote artificiality along with their employees and executives will suffer attacks. In some, everything that involves civilization, technology, and progress will be fiercely attacked. And if for that reason, during an attack, some citizen is wounded or killed, we won't care. We will be indifferent and indiscriminating. The population, the mass, the people, the community, the sheep, the society, does not merit our consideration. Neither warnings nor calls to attention nor anything at all, because they are all part of the system. Let it be clear, if they cross our path, they are going to regret it. And we already showed this in the past with ITS. In April of 2017, ITS claimed responsibility for the unprovoked murder of two hikers at the foot of Tualok Mountain in Mexico. The group is extremely difficult to research. Online rumors circulate that they take credits for attacks they did not have a hand in, that they are possibly a false flag orchestrated by the deep state, or perhaps they don't even exist. These plastic bottles are filled with fuel or combustible liquids. The incense stick functions as a wick to ignite the matchbook and set off the IED. The feather is taken from indigenous spiritual rituals, similar to a saging ceremony, and used to cleanse an area of evil spirits. In our case, these evil spirits are technology and civilization. For the young IED logs on discord, inactive terror as both a functional and aesthetic object aligns perfectly with their penchant for delusion literalism. It fulfills the anarcho-primitive as mandate to live without symbolic culture, and recalls the situation as desire to transcend representation by merging life and art. Here, aesthetics and radical action join as a singular object which encapsulates the totality of the ego extremist worldview. To an outsider, these major concepts may seem awkwardly shoehorned into one another. The post-left doesn't see it that way. In my time observing this space, no users have committed or attempted to organize real world violence. The Black Pill. It seems that the end trajectory for every type of online radical is ultimately the Black Pill. The network itself works to individuate and isolate everyone. All roads eventually lead to nihilism. What begins as a casual engagement with funny memes can rapidly metastasize. The most common path for this particular group seems to arrive at something called cyber nihilism, a blend of landian technopestimism and primitivist anxiety. Enough time spent in this space culminates in a type of ideological Stockholm syndrome. Many of these ideas already exist on a continuum tilted towards nihilism. Joining a doom cult is not too far a leap. Afterward. Anarcho-primitivism faded from the niche radical circles of Instagram, but it soon rippled outward into mimetic culture at large through platforms like TikTok and YouTube. Initially, many readers were shocked by the age range of the subjects featured in the essay and their apparent levels of political engagement and extremism. In the years following the publication, many comparable events seem to show that this was and still is, a widespread phenomena that has quickly become a normalized part of today's internet. Eventually, the communities featured in the essay fractured into distinct but overlapping groups. Some of them logged off, many others found their way into real world organizations. Politigram seems to constantly reinvent itself. Few of the original class of 2016 still remain on the platform. Every time I think it's over, something new and unexpected happens. While today's internet is much more heavily moderated, the root causes of radicalization and extremism remain unaddressed. Similar stories will continue to happen and likely become more frequent.",

Welcome back to another episode of Finvvs' History. I'm here with Horatio Goulds. Yeah. And today, we're talking about Northern Ireland, the troubles. And I'd like to start this by saying that I do still want to sell tickets in Belfast. Right. I'm not doing that on the tour. Aren't you? Are you fine? I'm fine. So, yeah. And there's ever a short memory, which is actually a famous in Dome. I think, I think, famous in every very long memory. I think that is the problem. It's also probably the closest thing to a live issue we've dealt with. Yeah. Would it ever feel like it's not live to us? Because that's what I love about it. Not in our lifetimes. Yeah. What I love about this, I mean, first I've got to say that I'm coming in Hawk is one of my favourite. Top 10 history of being troubles. Yeah. For what reason? Right. It's... So, yeah, what, it places as why this is a good topic. Okay, so top 10, obviously, Nazis hit the World Cup in a hot air. Yeah, I was 9-11. 9-11. Blair Rock. Slobber Damolosevic, disintegration of Yugoslavia. We get it, you're straight. I'm a straight man. Brooks Drift, Anglosio, Scramble for Africa. Big yes. Yeah. The biggest gap is the... Troubles is... Is so 9-11, what, 3,000 people do? Well, I imagine the old Scramble for Africa is similar to... I don't know, you're in a long-term marriage and you remember that one crazy one night stand. Do you know you had on your youth? That it's sort of like an escapism, right? It's a feral, yeah. Six guys. German, a French, an Austrian. And we all have a very big meeting about it. You had no responsibilities, you know? Yeah. That's Scramble for Africa. Those are the biggest British ever. All that sort of stuff. Hold the ride, just wait a minute. The ride is top 10. Anyway, the trouble. So 3,000 people die in 9-11, I think. Charlie, can you just confirm how many people die in 9-11? I think around that. It's around 3,000. I think you ballparked it. What's the death toll of the troubles? I think it's about 3,500. So it's 9-11 over 30 years. Right, that's what you... Okay. Yeah, 3-600. Okay. It's like test cricket. 9-11. It's slow. It's worn out. The periods of intense... Yeah, yeah. The whole thing is fucking chaos. What I love about the troubles. Then it slows down. It slows down. You think, oh, this is a bit boring. Yeah, and then it... And then just wait. The fast bowl is coming back on... McGinnis is... Bobby Sands comes to... New baller from the Pavilion and Martin McGinnis. Fuck. McGinnis had entered... Bobby Sands in the crease. What, what's this? What's he doing? He's shitting... He's shitting on the crease. That's not cricket. He's shitting on the crease. I've never seen anything like this in my life. He's smearing a shit on the stump. That's God to be it. It's basically... There's also the accent. So 9-11 would be... I guess 2020, but it's more... It's 20. It's 100. It's like it's... It's a vine. Too much happens too quickly. It's a vine. Exactly. This is a Russian novel. Yes. This is... Yeah. There's like super narratives... Slowly unraveling. Slowly unraveling. It's boring for lots of it. The accent is close to the Nazis for me in that like... You know... Harken, schacken, schacken, laden, laden, laden. Like it gets there. You know what I mean? Yeah. As far as villains go, the tough Northern Irish accent is up there. Yeah, terrifying. Like terrifying. Yeah. If you're getting tortured, the gay German and the really straight Northern Irish guy are the two most terrifying guys to be torturing you, right? Yeah, because you know you're going to be fucked by this. Because the German, man, it's like I feel slowly peel your skin off. Value of arch. Yeah. That's terrifying, but the gay... I'm going to get a hammer and smash in your kneecaps. But it could be saying anything. You think you're going to be tortured. Do you want a coffee? I like you, a black coffee knife. Look at me again and I'll make you a coffee. The accents phenomenal. It's brilliant. I love the Northern Irish accent. The uniforms. It's also as... I love how... As two British men. As two Protestant British men. We are... You know, the default, as we've said. We have the default. The first thing on the Sims, that's us. As you said before, I love how it's impossible to talk about this objectively, no matter how objective we think we're being. Oh, really? Because you can say something... As opposed to how objective we normally are. We're afraid of objectives on the show. The show is a study in objectivity. But the whole thing is a mess. Like, if you go on the Wikipedia article for the troubles. Right. We're often on Wikipedia articles for military history. The bligerence will make even the least ADHD person overstimulating. Really? There are so many acronyms, the ligerence, difference ultimately is Catholic. Even that's fun to say. Even that's fun to say. Jarrarant. Yeah, it's... What I love about the Nori and Irish accent is you enjoy every syllable. Every syllable. They're sitting there. They're sitting down there having a long lunch. In every syllable. Silly wasted. With the Northern Irish. They're hitting everything. Well, Jarrarant. So it's... But even like, even if you were to say this is like... Britain's... Or you'd say even... See, even Britain, you know, you're leaving out Northern Ireland. So if you said this is the UK's Vietnam, this the troubles. Even by saying that, you are then implying that Northern Ireland's not in the UK, which would piss off one side. So it's just the linguistics of this. Yeah. Are so fucked. And that's what you love. That's what I love. I love just like, listen. You're not trampling over things. Oh, it's just going to be an absolute mess. It's a... It's a crapture. It's, you know, all the different... You've got the... Even Northern Ireland, that's political. Because I... Even saying Northern Ireland. The north of Ireland for Catholic. Well, it's like... It's like a dairy bracket to London dairy. Everything is trans. Everything's non-binary. Everything's using day-to-day pronouns. I call it England dairy just to really have a bro. Yeah, that's a England dairy, isn't it? British dairy. Like, everything is so charged. The language of it. You're constantly having to... You know, it's like someone with 20 pronouns. Yeah. And you're like, oh, fuck, so much. Yeah, because what you're identifying as... Well, when it comes to this, I identify as that. You know, it's very zzer. Before 11, I'm at bay then. Between the hours of 11 and 3, I'm zzer. You know, people who use z pronouns, are like, come on. Yes. Like, they, all right. But when you get to z in like, X and stuff, it's like... I guess it's... Why do you use your name? That's quite individual. What it feels like with the troubles is because it is... And you go to Belfast, it does feel... It feels like it could be a city in the Midlands, like, aesthetically, right? Yeah. So it feels very British aesthetically. So when you hear about this, because it's removed, it does feel like a dystopian fancy novel about British... Yeah. ...sidle claps. Yeah. You know, there's, like, children of men, you know? Yes, yeah, yeah. Where it's like, part of what makes it a thrilling dystopia is because it's familiar but strange, right? Yes, totally hearing. That houses, I know, look like that. But what's he, what the fuck is... Yeah. But what I love about... It's a civil war in our parents' lifetimes in our country. My aunt's from Belfast, so she lived through a lot of the 70s. I really... Just like... ...Police. Don't know, actually. Because that's the amazing thing. I imagine she would be. She lived over here. But that's the amazing thing is that it's like... It is the reconciliation after it, mostly. It's kind of amazing. And that's why... Maybe it's essentially a school draw. Yeah. Sort of. Yeah, is it partly why maybe it's... Is it an underrated topic? I certainly globally, but because obviously Israel, Palestine, that's the big boy. When it comes to this sort of thing. asymmetric warfare. Yeah. And everyone's kind of... A lot of people have interest in that. But the troubles, I don't know how much people care about it outside of the UK. It doesn't... Yeah, well Americans famously always get like... Go to Dublin, go to Berlin to be in the UK. Yeah. All that stuff. Okay, some Americans for sure. But yeah, once again, it's like cricket. It's hard to explain. And it's not for you. No, it's not for you. Yeah, and it's fine that you don't get it. I'd find it boring too. Yeah, it's 30 years and it's a draw. It's test cricket. All right? It's five days, no one wins. But it's just something that happened while we're a light, right? That's the point. Yeah. So what we're going to do in this episode, because this is a massive topic, and we... Yeah. We're burning through things pretty fast. The first time I've thought, I don't think we can do this in a week. Chairman Mell, yeah, we'll whack you in a week. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So what we're going to do is in this episode, we're going to explain the context of the conflict. Mm-hmm. Try and get us up to about 1969, which is seen at the official beginning of the quote, the troubles. In our next episode, Friend of the Show, the other part of the Insell Holy Trinity, Victoria Angeloni, will be with us. He's from Belfast, so it'd be good to have a British perspective. Yeah. You'll hate that. But we're going to do 1972, or we'll see how we get. We'll see how we do. We'll see how we do. But it's going to be an ongoing series. Yes. I did either the same length as the actual troubles. Who called it the troubles? Is that just... I don't know, I sure. Can we find that out, Charlie? Who first called it the troubles? I don't know, the troubles feels... Because you know the English Civil War, people at the time called them the troubles. The people from Gloucester, digging up turnips. Oh, yeah. They called it the troubles. They didn't call it the Civil War, because they didn't understand it as a Civil War. So anything that bad happens to Irish people, they called the troubles, right? No, but this is in English people, Oh! called the Civil War, the troubles. Right. Because they didn't know what was going on. It does have that great English understatement, the troubles. Oh, so he, yeah. So it was called the troubles pretty much as soon as it started. Because the troubles I think are like tummy troubles. Do you know what I mean? That's where that's where... That's the other thing is it's a brutal sectarian conflict, and it's just calling it the oopsies. Basically. The oopsies, is the no-nose. Oh no, another bomb. Yeah. Bit of trouble here. Yeah. That's totally it. Well, it's the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. So it's a British... Right. It's a Westminster partition going. What is it? Bit of a pickle over there. They've got a ducky tummy across the ocean or something. There's lots of bombs going off. So, bit of context. Island of Ireland as a whole is famously not British. Yes. Britain, great Britain, hang on, there's the UK, which includes Northern Ireland at the time of record. Yeah. And... You see what I mean? Just constantly trying to... We don't know. Just constantly trying to back yourself into every corner. Because there's about seven audiences you're playing to. You know quite the topic. Yeah. And all of them sound like shopping channels. UVF, UDA, IRA. They're all shopping channels. UVF, QBC. It's like, you know how people go on about, oh, there's too many letters in the LGBT thing. Yeah. That's just Northern Ireland. The troubles. It's like, there's so many acronyms. There's so many letters. All of them hate each other. Yeah. Anyway. So, famously, Britain and Ireland are different countries. Then, let's break, let's go right back to the... It all starts kicking off around the chooders, right? Family the eighth. Yeah. Big fat fucker. But we don't learn about Ireland through the chooders. No. It doesn't seem to come into the English imagination that we were doing shit then. The island remembers. Island remembers. Famously, they remember everything. Britain forgets. Yes. Britain needs to forget to carry on. But Ireland remembers everything. It's like a marriage where like a guy does something, like forgets to clean the cup up. Yeah. And the woman's going to remember that and bring it up in an argument 30 years later. Do you let anything go? Yeah. Surely you can understand this. He has washed out mug up 30 years ago. It's illegal. I mean, I'm not comparing, you know, bloody Sunday to a cup not being washed up. I mean, it actually is like, it's a bit like Russia, Ukraine, if we're doing more direct power-level. Go on. Right, that's our... It's our Ukraine, isn't it? Like a smaller country with a slightly different ethnicity, arguably, to a bigger country that we sort of... Over 500, 600 years have sort of oppressed at different points. But then there's a significant population in Ukraine in this analogy that wants to be Russian. Yes. There is... Yes, sir. Yeah, in the Donbass region. Right. There's lots of Russian speakers. There's Ukrainian, there's Russian. Yeah. They try to just... Stalin try to destroy the Ukrainian identity with a famine. Bringing up Stalin? That's pretty... Oh, yeah, that's true. Yeah. You know, that's... And try to get rid of the Ukrainian identity with the Ukrainian language and make them all Russian speakers. Right. And there's been at many different points things like that throughout its history. Okay. And it's just flaring up again. Yeah. Flaring up. This isn't flaring up at the moment. No. I don't think. No, but... They're going through their troubles. Yeah. The troubles. The really, really... The Bubbles. So, Henry VIII, Big Fat, greedy fucker, he... He's so greedy that he wants eight wives. And Ireland. And Ireland. He wants to fuck Ireland. Now, I'm just... I don't actually know this, but it feels like... So, a big thing with Henry VIII is that he got blue balls because it was kind of a period of relative like peace for England and all of his heroes. All people he learnt about, like Henry V. Yeah. Had gone to France and been absolute alpha chads. Right. And it feels like Henry VIII wanted that more than anything and then ended up just being like a guy who wore nice clothes and ate loads of food and had fucked loads of women. But he wanted to be a military hero. But there's no reason to invade France in the small period he's on the throne. Right. So, do you think part of it is him getting his rocks off with, you know, taking his shit out on the little guy because he... You know... It feels like he can punch the big boy. It's like going home and hit your wife because you're getting shouted out by your boss at work. Right. I see. Or your football team loses. You go home. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. So he clears himself, King of Ireland in 1541. There's then the Nine Years War, which is... We never know about this for sure. Gay Lake Irish lords... A hero Neil. That's here, here a Neil. Who'd started the O'Neill's bar chain? Yes. He started his O'Neill's bar chain. So he's mainly profiteering off Chinese tourists unless they're square currently. But he stops that to fight the English in the 16th century. The English win that. And then a lot of stuff happens with James I. This is his sort of third or fourth appearance on this podcast. The famously gay in the world of dance and I know not my... Gay anti tobacco, astrologist witch head. Yeah. Anti tobacco. That was his big... Of course, yeah. He was one of the first people to come out against tobacco. He wrote a long treatise about why it's bad for your health. And he was gay. He was very progressive man. In some ways. In some ways. He was also burning one at the stake. Well, again, you know. Yeah, no. Is that coming? Is that coming down again? The pendulum swinging. The pendulum is always swinging. You know, we've got me to now it's swinging back to burning. Burning woman. I guess those are the two ends, aren't they? Of the women, the women pendulum. The hashtag me to fire whoever you want because they look to you weird, to bracket to... I'm going to set you on fire for making me horny. The experience of women throughout his job. So James I begins the plantation... Well, actually, he begins the plantation of Ulster. I believe plantations as a concept begin earlier. And they also happen all over islands. In Virginia, where that's got... Oh, well, the strategy... This is the beginning of the world, right? Beginning of the kind of... Is it a new world around in the six years? Yes, it's just because Columbus is 1495 or 192. 492? Yeah. And it's kind of... This is 1609. So this is the age of discovery is well underway. Right, there's early days. Queen Mary, the first, begins plantations in 1550s and I... Now, when I think plantation, you obviously think brutal, but you do think tropical. Yes. The deep south. There's a level of exoticism to a plantation in my mind. Big white house. Kind of those weeping windows. White being the... Yeah, say a word. Big white house. For the white man. You know, but there's a level of exoticism there. The plantations in Ulster, I do not feel... Yeah, you know. ...will give... There's not as much kind of like... Hard work, I think. Colorful imagery. I mean, not to say that the plantations in Barbados wasn't hard work. It was a doth for the... For the slave. But I guess the slaves were at least in a nice climate, you know. When you clock off, which is about an hour a week. Maybe an hour a week. You can enjoy the sunset. I saw a motivational TikTok genuine from one of the psych pass, you know, who brought up the slaves worked 18 hours a day. So, so can you. Wow. So, it was kind of using... It was using the productivity of slavery... Yeah. ...to try and be like... To try and make that like a hustle grind set sort of inspirational thing. And that is the next stage of that movement. It is. It's people like... Or technically, if you're worked to death, you still work load. So, you could choose to do that and beat the competition, right? Free your mind and work like a slave. LAUGHTER Stop being a sheep or... And but come and save yourself. Save yourself. Yeah. Hand yourself in to a master who will work in a death. LAUGHTER Yeah, that's the closing of that, sir. Yeah, yeah. That horseshoe. LAUGHTER So, but yeah, you're right. I mean, else to plantations. You maybe get a bit about what life was like on else to plantation. Because it is. Rubbish. Yeah. I mean, it just, it sounds grim. LAUGHTER But there were plantations all over Ireland. Right. And they didn't, they all put in a lot of tape. What are they? Plantations. I don't actually know. I want to say potatoes that may be intensive. That might be insensitive. But also... What's the woke up? The bananas, man. Yeah. Yeah, sure. In Northern Ireland, they were planting bananas. You know, all those Irish bananas we eat. LAUGHTER You know, the big banana famine. LAUGHTER We've run out of bananas. There's no bananas anymore. LAUGHTER What were we planting specifically? I think actually it was anything. I think plantation is code for... Miscellaneous. Miscellaneous farming. LAUGHTER No, it's pineapples. The point is it's about... Oats. The main crops are growing with oats. Yeah, Irish pines start raising cattle and sheep. What you know what it is actually, is that... So the Irish at this point are mainly farming cattle. Famously Irish beef, still today. Brilliant. One of the best beefs. They've got Irish, they do four or five things unbelievably well. Anything dairy-related. So cream, butter. Milk, butter. I mean, I start beef. I actually think that's what... Elyse. Elyse. I think that's what Henry the 8th is going. He's the butter. He's a butter boy. Look at him. He's a big butter boy. He goes, this butter shits. What butter tourism, you think he's doing? Yeah, yeah, yeah. He's a butter tourist. Like a sex tourist. He's going to Ireland and licking. He sees their butter, he's like, we've got to get down this country. So I think he basically... I think in his head he's a butter king. Yes. Henry the 8th. That was very good producing from Utah. That's the quickest he've been on the sea. Henry the 8th, 8th butter, often for breakfasts. Butter was a common ingredient in chewed dishes. I think he also ate a congerial and poor poise. I mean, the guy... He ran out of things to do when you were the king. But also... He's not allowed to invade France. So he's like, yeah, I guess I'll try a fucking... What's that? Poor poise. I'll eat that then. Can I eat... Is that a fucking thing or an 80 thing? That's how he divided everything. He divided everything to fucking things and 80 things. Can I eat that? All right, I'm going to fuck it then. Think Verizon, the best 5G network is expensive? Think again. Bring in your AT&T or T-Mobile Bill to a Verizon store today and we'll give you a better deal.

No, the butter, the mecha of butter. Godly, the mecha of butter. Have you seen the clip of the two Irish women? There's an Irish podcast and they're talking about butter and one of them is maybe like a vegan or lactose intolerant and the way the other two are judging her is so phenomenal. She's like, oh, no, I don't really do that. And they're like, what? They're like, oh my god, you're killing yourself. Kill you. Live a little. Live a little. I'm getting a pass a carry gold. And they just like, but it's almost like they're talking about smoothies, but they're talking about butter. Is butter back in? Because there was maybe a period where you never left me. No, no, it never left me, but I mean in the general trend. I think lads coming back. I think it should come back as we talked about. We're kind of like with my RFK junior when it comes to this. I'm pro large. It's the seed oil that are killing people. Oh, see, fine. If you use it, you know, blood butter, that's what we're all healthy because we grew up to eating blood butter. Butters. I mean, I wish. No, but you know, like there was a trend, I feel when I was growing up where butter's cholesterol going to kill you. Yeah. And now it's the raw eating raw beef and fats are good for you, right? We're now going to the alpha chads. Leverking. We've had, yeah, we've had woke dietary things where it's mung beans and all that sort of stuff. And now we're pretending that raw beef and butter is the healthiest way to eat for a little bit. Do you know what? The woke war on food has been decisively lost. Yes. Because the vegan... The cold war on food. The cold war on food. The burden of war is falling. The Berlin war of tofu has crumbled. Yeah, because veganism has actually peaked. Now, there's an obstacle about that every year in the times because that's what they want to hear. They read this. But it has peaked. In the telegraph, they haven't even heard of veganism yet. No. What? Huh? Is that just people who eat cheese? But there is actually the supermarket shelves they're now filling the... They had, whenever the peak was, they had shelves full of all the vegan replacement products. And now they're just, it's a money pit so they're just getting rid of them and putting vegan. Yeah. Basically, it's the long-term effects of people who've been doing veganism for a while. There's some health effects when you just eat. Yeah. And also, if I was vegan, the stuff I'd end up eating would just be worse for me. So I'd just be eating chips and pizza. Seven then goes like, no, they're not doing it properly. It's like, because doing it properly is lame. It's so, uh, gross. Doing it properly is eating fucking the hair that comes off beans and shit. Yeah, I went for a New Year's meal once, uh, uh, uh, vegans. It was, it was like a spread. There's so much food and everything was horrendous. Everything was beige. It was bean loaf. Yeah, bean loaf. Yeah. And then it was like, um, yeah. Oh, do you want another slice of bean loaf? You know, loathe people, but my god, it'd be really rare. The words to bean and loaf should not go together. And that's just loaf bean, which is actually a slur. Such a meat eater. Yeah. So what is your slur? Loathe bean is a slur for a vegan, I think. I was such a meat eater and I was almost, it's probably a bit of a problem where I have to have meal. Me, basically two out of three meals a day, I have to have it. But I agree with that. I do do the odd, um, meat free Monday, meat free, and Monday dot com. Part of me, so yeah, a lot of people talk about this. Yeah, I don't see the, I don't see any point. What about fish? I like, yeah, meat or fish. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So I mean, like it has to, but otherwise, so I was at this vegan thing and I was like, I haven't had a meal without meat. I did it without meat for like four months. So I was getting the shakes. Yeah, yeah. It can be in load. The pudding was made, was like, I think, cake made with vegan mayonnaise. Mayonnaise and cake. Vegan mayonnaise. Mayonnaise and cake. Yeah. Because they don't count these buttons. So they're just fucking chucking vegan mayonnaise. But what's mayonnaise is eggs? So what's a vegan egg? Tofu, Flaxseed, Meal, chia seeds, Aqua Fable, which is the liquid from chickpeas. Sorry. So that little gummy stuff that chickpeas come in, you're making an egg out of that. Yeah. It's not right. But do you not feel that the sweet back? I did, I did flavoring like black salt to mimic the eggy taste. So Ireland having a real comeback culturally, that, you know, there are like, been almost like South Korea in the sense that. Yeah, there's soft power. There's soft power. There's foam, poor mezcal, all these, you know, there lots of stuff. But it's also coming in as now all the kind of bro podcast, I'm talking about the health foods now, is raw beef butter eggs. Eggs. It feels like there's some, there's an Irish hands going in that. There are cholesterol economy. Ireland. So they're really, I don't know, it feels like an Irishman has set this all up, where we're now pretending that to eat the steak and eggs for every meal is the healthiest way to. So Ireland is essentially, before, well, listen, the English are involved in Ireland from the 12th century. But before this point, the Irish are mainly doing beef and butter. And then the, when the English come in with the plantations, they say that beef and butter, they're like, they're like the woke guys. They're like, oh, that's not very sophisticated. The most sophisticated thing to do is grow crops, is because we're, at this point, this is like the Puritans with the, with the friends, the friends blue hairs like, you're eating beef, I mean, you're eating, I mean, yeah. So they're like plants and mung beans and shit. And that's, I think the plantations are for farming crap, rabbit food. Oh, yes, they're woke to the end. They set up woke food plantations all over Ireland, but most of them fail. And it's about, they're then making Scots mainly in Ulster land lords and dispossessing the Irish people of their lands. Scots of a big part in this. So the plantation of Ulster, which becomes the most successful plantation, Ulster, for those who don't know, is the county in the north. And it's a very short distance between Ulster and Scotland. So I imagine the route you can get people over. Well, I think that must be the accent, right? That must be the Northern Irish accent, it must be because it comes from Scotland. It comes from Scotland. And it goes down to Northern Ireland. It's Brendan Rogers, right? Brendan Rogers is the journey. It's the journey between Scotland and Northern Irish. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So that plantation of Ulster begins under James I, 1609, and he basically sends Scots, Presbyterians, who as we know, the hardest fuckers on this earth, what I'm descent, granite, diamond cut, fuckers, no one's fucking with them. He sends them over to Ulster to make this new breed of super Scott, the Northern Irish. Because they're arguably, if you're trying to find someone tough at the Presbyterian Scots, you go, Protestant Northern Irish. And both of those are the only people I would trust in a war against white South Africans. Yeah, because that's what... Who are Dutch Protestants? Essentially the hardest set of the clonialist. White ones are some of the fuckers. Yeah. Apart from Australia, because they're prisoners. Yes, yeah. They broke the law. Yeah. These guys make the law. And then Kat Canada and New Zealand have been cut out. Cut. They're watching the whole world get fucked from their backyards. They're not doing anything. So based the plantations, beginning 1609, busing hard, hard-nosed Scots, fuckers over to Ulster, the Ulster plantation is... Red nose. It's the only red nose, red face. To put that drink down. The whole Presbyterian thing is that drinking's a sin, right? Yes. And they're going into Ireland, which is drinking water is lame. Yes, yes. It's like a real culture clash. Yeah. I mean, culture clash is in one way to describe the troubles. Yeah, yeah. It's key with. So there's obviously loads of rebellions from this point onwards. But essentially, Northern Ireland is kind of... You could say it's inevitable when the success of that plantation happens. Right. So there's a rebellion against the postent in 16... Yeah, it's like a successful... Star Wars was a hit. They're going to make another one. Yeah. And they're going to make it a lot of them, which is the troubles. Yeah. It was a hit. What do you want to do? Of course, we're going to do another one. Yeah. And then we're going to leave it alone for a bit. And then we're going to make a bunch more. Yeah, of course. It's test cricket of sci-fi. It's Star Wars. So the rebellion in 1641, which leads to protestants massacring the Catholics as reprisals... Well, so those Catholics masquer the Protestants and then the reprisals. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's Tiff Attack. The whole history of Ireland or the... It's Tic-Tac-A. It's Tic-Tac-A. Right, if Shavvy and Easter... You can move. You can move. Triangle, little... Triangle as well. Shrink in the pitch. Highlines. Tiff Attacker. Tiff Tac-A. Tiff Tac-A. There's then the William of Orange now... And he's a big deal. He's a really big deal. To these guys. I don't really know him. Well, do he... Seems to be the most Protestant man ever. I think Orange is the most Protestant color you can be, right? Yes. Is that because you've gone orange from shouting? I think so. Yeah. I don't put that guy in, no! That's why it's the genre. So he's the most orange person ever. He defeats... So this is the glorious revolution, right? In England, yeah. You know about that. So this is the gayest Dutch guy over, right? Basically, one of the English King, once again, is getting too much fun. If everyone thinks he's Catholic, basically thinks he's a homosexual, globally. And then they basically ship in a Dutch King who's married to... Technically, next to the road through on the Queen. Who would be the Queen? So he's wife Mary, yeah. And get them in together. And he comes with loads of troops, but there's no... No one stands up for him. So it's like a glorious revolution, because no one dies. He just walks through. But that one is glorious. Right, okay. So people say that this country hasn't been conquered since 1066, but a Dutchman did just walk in and become King. We let the door unlock for the Dutch. Yeah. So he comes in solidifying the Protestant dominance in Austrian Ireland. I guess... Sorry, I guess William Orange is like final nail in the coffin, Protestantism. It's a dominoste. It's a... Yeah, but it still... It's still a minority on the island. Yeah. Because you're talking about the descendants of tens of thousands of Scottish settlers. Yes. So in a country of like five million, there's like one million, got prots. Right. For the next couple hundred years, the Catholics are discriminated against in Ireland, penal laws. They're not... They can't hold political office. I mean, yeah, it's a partite, right? It's a partite. It's right apart. White on white apart, I... Which is like... Which is not... Which is not win-win. You would think. But as white people, that would be like, well, great, fine, a partite. But the note, there is... It's proctor partite. Yes. Yes. Yes. Catholic a partite. Which is... Irish Catholics maybe are some of the biggest fumbleers of white privilege in human history? Definitely. And they think that's why... They're the whitest people and they've managed to... They managed to fumble all of it until about 30 years ago. Well, that's what's amazing about like... You've got the British straight white man. Yeah. Is in the popular imagination. Yeah. Is demonised as the embodiment of privilege. And yet you've been sent to... The whitest people. The Irish are seen as somehow charming, poetic... Yeah. Like... Slayers of privilege. They're seen as the... They're like, in his gardens, basically. Yeah. In the cultural capital. Yeah. I mean, to be... No, but you fare. I don't tell them a real tough time, but they're really enjoying themselves now, right? Oh, yeah, they're picking up a big time. They're picking up a big time. Because now they have all the white privilege. Yeah. Right, they're not getting stopped by police in America. You know, whatever privilege you get... Yeah. The accents call, they're getting laid very easily. Mess cows like the sexism. Yeah. They're in all that. And then none of the guilt. No guilt. No guilt. Not an ounce for anything. No. Just because they would drunk the whole time when we were doing all that stuff. They now got away with any guilt. I know. And they're picking up when they're gone... Oh, this is brilliant. And where they're going? Well, excuse me, what? Well, I'm now getting rich at the loss, as well. Yeah, we looked after you for three-five and a few years, and now we're the bad ones, are we? That was happening. We did. We did look after them, yeah. Famously. Well, this is where the looking after and really starts to begin, is the sort of 19th century. There's an active union... Tough love. Yes, yeah. There's an active... It's adopting a child who doesn't want to be adopted. It's Madonna taking an African kid out of a village and then calling him Blaine or whatever. It's got a year Woody Allen. Yeah, that's exactly what it is, actually. It's Woody Allen fucking his 19-year-old adopted daughter. Allegedly, or definitely, I get confused with those two. Definitely. Definitely, just for the legal definition. Definitely. Definitely. I'm not meant, definitely. Sorry, allegedly, I get confused. We should do an episode of Woody Allen, actually. Oh, we definitely should do that, actually. Woody Allen! So the active union in 1901 creates the nice kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. You then have... And listen to all this stuff we could do a whole episode about. Yeah. And if you're not careful, we will. Yes. If you keep subscribing, we'll end up here. If you don't, baby, just stop. Don't stop blaming yourself. We're going to do a whole episode of the 1801 active union. So then, listen, we'll just... We'll fast forward the 19th century. Big, famine, boo-boo. You got us. Sorry. We'll do a famine episode. We'll do a famine episode. We'll do a famine episode, of course. I'm just trying to get to the... Maybe we do a famine episode, we get Mike Rice, but we hog time. I think we should be at each one of Rags. But then we put like a... So you can't speak. So you're just there and we discuss the famine. Because there's a potato in his mouth. Hog time with a potato, and a string of up. And talk about this one. I think the optics would be quite bad, actually. Would you think? Yeah. People watching, is this ironic or... I don't know what irony is, if this is ironic, it just feels mean. So the famines, the 1840s, there's then a concerted effort to introduce home rule, which is self-government. So it's not even about being independent, it's just self-governing, because Britain has taken complete political control of Ireland. This is a big deal, even for Brits, actually. The home rule question. Yes. This goes on for 50 years, basically. And the World War I actually blows us out of the water. But this was kind of the crisis of the early 1900s, in Britain, home rule, was... Divide loads of politicians. It was a big deal that people actually cared about in this country. It was the undoing of prime ministers in the way that Briggs it was. Yes. But just because World War I was such a big deal, the home rule thing kind of gets a bit warped. Well, they signed home rules, and this is going to happen during the war. But then they went, okay, let's delay it again, because the war's going on. Right. And then the fucking Germans sent weapons to the Irish Republicans. So now we're getting into some of the terminology that gets used in the troubles. So we should... The IRA, the Irish Republican... A big part of the whole thing was, getting, trying to get weapons on the island, right? Because they don't want to make it. Ireland are always trying to get weapons in, because if they don't do that, they've just got cows and butter. So the reason that they're so easy to dominate from the English is that we've got guns, and they've got packs of butter. So they are chucking butter at us, and we've got muskets. Well, my... Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Get back with you. Have some more butter. And they're trying to push cows down hills into British forces. Anyway, home rule is essentially... Starting to get introduced. But... So are you saying that before the Easter Rising, if they hadn't risen, they would have got self-government, naturally? No, because it's Catholic emancipation. There's wolf. What's his name? The Tans. There's all this... How about you, or your black and tans? No, it's wolf. What's his name, Charlie? There's a guy... 19th century Irish, Phoenian. There's the Phoenian Rising. There's a huge history of Irish Republicans who are in the Victorian age, but I'm just saying, that's not this episode. We're trying to get to the troubles. Right, so the point is, that in the late 19th century, home rule is kind of gathering momentum. Yes. But the old-ster plantation, the Presbyterian hardnows, white-south Africans running a party in the North, they're like, fuck home rule. Don't want to give anything. We want to be... We want the entire island to be... As they consistently do around the world. Fuck home, fuck that! They want to be... There's 15 of us. There's two million of them. We'll fucking take them. We'll... They're drunk. We're not. Let's fucking go. Right? So they want to be unified totally with Britain. And there's this guy who's termed the father of Northern Ireland. There's a guy called Edward Carson. Right. Who is it? This point, he's called Anglo-Irish, because that's what you call if you... And like, if you look at the Oscar Wilde story... Yeah, this was never he. Yes. So, Edward Carson is an Anglo-Irish man, which means that... They're often... They learn at Trinity College Dublin. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Which doesn't let Catholics in at this point. No, I don't think so, yeah. So, Edward Carson is a lawyer. He's Anglo-Irish, which means he's... Of Irish descent, but living in England. He's a hot shot lawyer. So he's doing a show's bout being mixed race at the Edinburgh Fringe. Yeah, he's winning awards. And... To the Irish prejudice. LAUGHTER So he is called the father of Northern Ireland. Right. Because... Daddy... LAUGHTER He holds loads of cabinet roles in Westminster as well by the end of his life. Well, when you look at white guys in this period on Wikipedia, they have lots of letters by their names. Because it's the colonial era. Yeah. Wikipedia of any white guy. He's PC, I want to clear. Right, on the wall of the Lord. PC, PC, Ireland, KC. Oh, yes, PC, PC, Councils out. So he's very racist. I found a big fan of the racial joke. PC, PC, brackets, Ireland, KC, because he was a Tony General for a bit. Yeah. Anyway, so this guy, essentially, I think, founds or at least is one of the first leaders of the Ulster Unionist party, the UUP, which... It turns into the DUP. Maybe. Sort of, right. But it could also just carry on, because there's a real people's front of Judea, I think, with all this stuff. Right, yeah, yeah, yeah. So... Anyway, so he's a hotshot lawyer, and his biggest case is in Dublin. He takes Oscar Wilde to court for being gay, which is a crime. He represents the guy. Yes, yeah. Which is an episode in itself, because that's hilarious. It's a very funny story where he, Oscar Wilde is like, you know, he's a better the ball. He's a better the ball. Everyone loves it. He's team-frying. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And everyone's like, oh, he's so... I know it's illegal to be gay, but he's so cute. He's a bit of Michael Jackson. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like, the art is so good. Yeah. Everyone's like, ah! And the importance of being earnest, maybe his biggest play, is the guy that's running at the time of... That's the thriller. Yeah. Yeah. And that's opening at the time of him getting... Well, the trial. Yeah. Literally, it opens at that time. So Edward Carson is the lawyer, and, you know, Wilde makes the ball laugh. And this is the most furious British wiskery guy, is the guy trying to sue Oscar Wilde for fucking his son. Something like that, yeah. Yeah, that is it. He's just like, you can't fuck my... This is when I will sue you. You can't fuck my son. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I love that's how homophobic this here it is, is that if your... Gisan was not... We've got to fuck with someone else, you would sue the person who fucked you. Yeah, and he's so witty that he runs rings round him, but he's just like, ah! Well, you, why are you harder? Well, he does run rings round him, but Carson eventually flusters him, because he says, uh, did you fuck this rent boy? Yeah. And Wilde goes, no, because he was so ugly, I pitted him, I wouldn't. Yeah, yeah. And then Carson goes, so the only reason you didn't fuck him was because he was like, he was ugly, not because he's a boy. And Wilde goes, uh, uh, uh, uh, and like he gets someone the ropes, and basically Wilde says, uh, well, maybe I should think I'm trying to be funny, chill out, it's a joke. Yeah, it's a joke. And basically, I would say... That's a Jones defense. Yeah. It's a character. Yeah. So, you're not like Jones is very close to Ryan's gay junior. He is much bigger. I guess they're quite similar, maybe. But Carson, uh, I think what then happens is that the Wilde trial, uh, the wildest, the wildest actually suing the other guy for libel. That's what this trial is. Yeah, and then the libel case... The gayest man in London is saying something for libel for calling him gay. Yes, yeah, which is a very gay thing to do. Um, but these people are bad. I've seen, he's obviously a good lawyer, but I feel, I don't know anything about the law, but I feel I could have, uh, I could have won that case. Just drop your trousers. What, yeah, just drop your trousers. Just drop your trousers. Just drop your trousers. Yeah, look at him. Ticks out no bones. I'm going to be the guy with the Krovat. That guy's gay. Ticks out no boners. Okay, he calls a jerk and he's got a boner. And then he ends up wheeling out about 45 different people that Oscar holds fucked. Yes. And then we're going to get off that guy. Yeah, I fucked him. Yeah, of course. Well, that means your guilt is well, but that's a separate issue. We'll get to that. Um, but then a wild...

He also, I think, found the Ulster Volunteer Force, which is the loyalist, i.e. Protestant, i.e. unionist, paramilitary force that goes on to do a lot of damage in the actual troubles. But he's there planning to do stuff against the British Crown. Because they don't want home rule. Right, and it looks like that's where the tide's turned. And that does kind of go. And I think it's 1916, Easter Rising in Dublin, which is led by the IRA. But home rule, self-government, is home rule Ireland or they just get to run their own country? They get through the part of the British Empire. No, they're still part of the British Empire. They're still in Commonwealth. Fine, fine, fine, fine. But they get a parliament in Ireland. It's kind of like Canada would be at this time. Yeah, yeah. They're so not being independent. And that's the point. You can't British is holding them. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So, blah, blah, blah, Easter Rising. Again, that's an episode in itself. Irish War of Independence. This is where the IRA and Britain have a bit of it. So this is the point is that home rule has been signed in. And they've got it. But the Irish won independence. They want to reform a republic. 1920, 1921, Northern Ireland becomes a separate entity within the UK with its own parliament, stormont, that's, Alster, County of Alster then becomes. Right. So six counties in the north of Ireland. They want to buck. Oh, then in Shrine, there's Northern Ireland. And then the Irish Free State isn't Shrine in 21, which is still what my nan calls it because she's fucked. And then she also calls South Africa Orange Free State. Right. She's very old. She doesn't Bobway, Rhodesia. Rhodesia. My grandmother calls Kenya, Kenya. Kenya, yeah. That's the real sign. I remember I was saying his parents are going to holiday in Kenya. Oh, you can't be saying that. Help yourself, brother. Help yourself. Kenya. So there's then Irish Civil War, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. We get to the Second World War, which these guys famously sit out. It's a confusing one because, where's the Second World War? Yes. And they're finally the good guys. And it's a bit confusing for the Irish. But this is why the Irish, like, we know nothing about the Second World War. They just ignore it because we're the good guys for once. Yeah. So they're like, well, no, no, no, no. And they're also the whole thing of life. Maratively, it's confusing. My enemies enemy is my friend. They're like, well, you're like Hitler, do you? You're on the other side. Yeah. Think about that. Well, because we worked out with Victoria's, because we often make well-wild two references, because we grew up with British dads. And then they're like, well, I'm not going to say that. I'm going to say that. I'm going to say that. I'm going to say that. So you've got on here, side. Yeah. Think about that. Well, because we worked out with Victoria's, because we often make well-wild two references, because we grew up with British dads. Yes. And you can't escape well-wild two references. I think you know the way we rely. The thing you know the British dad, because he's from Northern Ireland. That's the problem with this thing. Is that even though Victoria is a Catholic. Yeah, yeah. And he probably, we'll get into this when he comes here. But yeah, that's the whole mind of it. But speaking of the Victoria, their well-wild two is the trot. So in the way that British dads are obsessed with well-wild two, I think if I was fighting well-wild two, I'd have been a hero, D-Day, all that stuff. Northern Irish dads is the trot. Yeah. It's making up that you did stuff in the trot. Yeah. You know, exactly. All that stuff. So we get into blah, blah, blah, whatever we'll do with it later. We get a 1949, and that's it. The problem of Ireland's officially leaves the Commonwealth. So they're not in the Commonwealth Games after this. No, which they're really gutted about. So when they were like, OK, if we go independent, do we not get the Commonwealth Games? And we were like, no, no, no, like please. Please, can we work out some kind of deal? Just something so we could please. Please, swim against Namibia. The Commonwealth Games is so shit. Yeah. Like, just who's watching that? Who's watching that? Yeah. And it's the less powerful Britain gets, the more awkward it gets. Yeah. Because what is it? It's Britain, it's the four-clin diamonds, it's the Pacific Island that still exists. There's loads of countries in the Commonwealth Games. In the Commonwealth Games. Yeah. But there's loads of them. But is it the same people that are in the Commonwealth? Does it correlate to who's in the Commonwealth? Yeah, pretty much. I mean, there's people who will make a political statement or not doing it. Yeah, which is pretty sure. Like Bangladesh, Pakistan, India, Canada, Australia. It's the Empire. And there's loads of countries. It's the Empire Games. Yeah. No, it's two. Unless it does less or more, it'd be better. It's a weird number. It's like, let's all, the whole world do it. Yeah. But it's the quarter of the world doing a World Cup of competitions. It's like Eurovision, but it's got Australia and Israel in it. You're like, what is this? Like, is there any integrity to this or not? Like the idea of someone watching Eurovision where there's a fucking like goth troll screaming to a microphone. But it's like, it's from Israel. This is competition to Joe. This competition's a fast. Israel's not from Europe. The collapse of Western civilization. Australia in your religion. I'm canceling my license fee. So, Ireland becomes Republic. There's then a border campaign where the IRA try and end British rule in Northern Ireland. This fails. It's about 62 they give up. Right. At this point, the IRA is still the official IRA. Still the, they've not split into now. That's what I call. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I can't believe it's not the IRA. And all the butter, actually butter, all that. That's the IRA, dietary, IRA. Yeah, exactly. IRA zero, which is what they have now. So, there's still one IRA at this point. Yeah. Right. Now, again, time is flying by, but we'll get to the 60s. Because that's where essentially in the 60s in Northern Ireland, which is the, now the juicy thing here is that in the Northern Ireland's majority Protestant. Yes. Yes. Just. But on the island of Ireland, the prostitutes are minorities. Yes. So, the whole dynamics is you have a majority, the Catholics in Northern Ireland are a minority within a minority. Yes. And then the Protestants are a majority within a majority. But everyone feels on the siege, essentially. Yes. Because it's a sticky one. It's a sticky wicket. Martin McGuinness has come onto the ball. And there's foot marks. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And there's also shittled over the steps. Bobby Sands was up to opening, but he should not be opening, because he can't keep his balls close. It's like the relinika shot on the pitch. Right. Yeah, Bobby Sands wought, so Paul or Radcliffe could write. And Paul or Radcliffe famously couldn't run, because she's shissing us. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Who's your biggest inspiration, Paul? Probably Bobby Sands. Could you just shout and crack on with it? No, the thing is, if I ever shit on camera, shit on stage, shit, like, you know, if I'm ever caught shit myself, I'm in the situation that liniker and Radcliffe fans have. Yeah. You have to make it a protest. Right. Don't you? Because it's so embarrassing, shitting yourself. The only way out of it. So I'd have to probably go like free garter. Are you saying that Bobby Sands shat himself and then retroactively went, no, no, I'm embarrassed. I'm a Republican. I meant that. He was apolitical. I meant that. I meant that. You got it. Look, I'm putting on the walls. Look, if you shat yourself, you're caught and shit yourself. Yeah. What are you then making up? It's a free hit, isn't it? You've already shat yourself. You might as well donate it to a cause of your chasing. Yeah. Stop wailing in Japan. Hang on. Are you saying? Are you saying? Are you saying? Are you saying? I mean, someone shat yourself and then someone calls you out. You should. The first thing you say is your only opportunity to name a court. You have to think of a cause. Yeah. And that's your one out. Yeah. It would be about how the post office scandal was dealt with. The president of the government is a dirty protest. So you could. Did you shat yourself? The rising IT scandal is an absolute tragedy. And I will not wipe my ass until it is so off. I will keep shooting myself until it's off. So yeah, you have to. So you have to always keep that weager Muslims. I think they've been badly treated. Yeah. And then it's like, mate, you're running out of causes. You've done three post trousers. You've done three post in your pants. You've not changed your trousers yet. So if you're leaving the house with a dig your tummy, you should also be armed. You should go on Twitter and see what kind of place it is. Get ready to play it out. Arm yourself with a cause. Stop whalers in Japan. Stop the whalers in Japan. I did actually ship myself in as an adult in Edinburgh. It was late night. I'd just been drinking the Tom stayed. Right. Okay. Well, say no more. Exactly. You probably put some mad LSD in my drink or something. And I was crossing a road. Yeah. And as I was crossing the road, I farted and it was shit. Right. And I immediately just turned left and started walking to where my house was. Right. Because I think that's, I think if you ever see someone move like a chess piece in that way where they're walking and they immediately turn it like a knight in chess. They just shut themselves. Yeah. Because you know what? The knight doesn't just. Yeah, you never do that. You'd always like go round. But it's just a hard term like a sort of a. Well, the context is the situation is very different. You know, why are you walking that way? I've got clean pants. I've got shoes in my pants. That's you can see in the line of deviation on like a map. Clean pants please. It's like a nonsense is different. Yeah. You're playing a different game. If you have Gary Evelyn, Jamie Carriga looking at the footage of me walking. They go, you can see just where the shit is his pants and the immediately. Well, yeah, it's all like holding your right. He holds his run and then and then he's. He goes. You see the ball the ball is played the shit is panties. That's really covers run. So anyway, what the fuck were we talking about? Sorry. I think we hit the 16. So it's grown discrimination against Catholics. So my point is is that in Northern Ireland, the Protestants have all the positions of power. There's the RUC, which is the Royal Ulster Constabulary, which I think is essentially. The RUC. The RUC. You have to be. I think it's 80% pro, but essentially no one's rejoining it if they're not. Prots. There's a bit of crossover with loyalist paramilitaries. Yeah. No, T boys. They're all quite naughty boys. Yeah. This is the real story of the naughty boys. They could help keep in their hands up the cookie jar these guys. These guys. These are some wrongs. There's some real wrongs on all sides. So the RUC, RUC. It's essentially it's yes. No, are you seeing? I can't see anything. The RUC are. Yeah. So the Catholics essentially second-class citizens in Northern Ireland. It's apartheid. It's apartheid. It's apartheid that they're doing it against white people. That's how fucking apartheid it is. Yeah. South Africa. Look at this guy. Yeah. That's the party. That you're going for. That's the party. Yeah. I mean, this is just against the blicks. Yeah. There's no. Yeah. Because you reckon there was anyone in South Africa who was like, can we chuck some of the shit whites in those? Well, my mate, John's, we've got some, got no stories. Do you reckon he could you take other white when it comes to ethnicity when you do? White other. White other than shit. Just like a shit hang. Hey, hey, Steve Beaker. Come on. Could you take my mate, John? He's the annoying white. He's got no chance. Yeah. Christ. And if you're annoying some Africans, then you must be really fucking annoying. Anyway, so. So the Catholics are, the second class citizens in Northern Ireland, they're like, um, Oh, it's like this. There's housing. There's housing issues, which to play devil's advocate, they're also fucking loads of them because they don't work condoms. Well, that's why Catholics are going to overtake Protestants pretty soon in Northern Ireland. Because they're, yeah, it's like a sort of birth rate panic. Yeah. Because the Prods are having one kid because they're like, I've got to work. Yeah. I've won child replacement. I'm done. I mean, it's like a sort of congal line of shagging that's got to go. Yeah. And part of the reason that the troubles is so entrenched and bad is that when any one person dies, they've got 20 brothers and sisters. Well, I welcome home. Yes. So it's like, you killed my brother and it's like, fuck, how many brothers is this guy happy? Yeah. It's because they're Catholics. So there's so many of them. Yeah. They're all related for the blood family. Exactly. You only have to kill three people. You killed my third cousin. Well, that's pushing a bit like you're all third cousin. Come on. I see my third cousin. I couldn't name my third cousin. Who cares? But because the Catholics like their families. Yeah. And they've got massive families. You killed my fourth cousin twice removed. I'm going to kill you. It's like me. I couldn't. Christ I didn't even speak to my aunt. You know. So, so there's housing. There's Jerry Manjering as well. That sounds like a slob. There's a guy called Jerry Manjering. Well, Jerry Manjering sounds like a slob. You know, he was out Jerry Manjering. He was caught Jerry Manjering. Yeah. It's a bit like cottaging, isn't it? Well, it is cottaging. Because you're rottering Jerry. Jerry Manjering is cottaging. Jerry Manjering is cottaging. But when you move the borders slightly of the toilet. Right. Of the toilet stall. What is actually Jerry Manjering? What is it? It's where you fuck with election borders to make sure that you're going to win. Oh, I see. It's a genuine Jerry Manjering. Jerry Manjering is used as a shorthand for other stuff. Wouldn't you just fiddling around? What you're saying is, it's when you go, when you go and nosh them off in a service station, but you open two stalls of the toilet. So you move the wall slightly. So that someone essentially has to put their cocktail on. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Jerry Manjering is like glory-hulling, except you push the stall of the toilet so far one way. You manipulate them into a glory hole. You remove the boundaries of the cubicles. So that someone is shitting in the toilet. And you take the separate wall away. And then you're a gay guy looking different. So you suck off the guy. Anyway, so Jerry Manjering. Jerry Manjering is the head of the IRA. No, he does not have any to do it. So in the 60s and Northern Ireland, the Catholics are dispossessed and Jerry Manjering, housing and jobs. They can't get jobs. And they see what's happening in the US with Martin Luther King. Right. And they essentially start the civil rights or civil low rights, as I call it. This is the Northern Irish civil rights movement. Well, I imagine Southern American black Americans cannot understand this. Yeah. But you're white. What the... You guys are all white. How the fuck are you? Yeah. How did you end up here? Yeah. Exactly. What did you do? How the fuck did you fuck up? Did you see what I called? Yeah. How the fuck I said in my life? And they're like, we're on the plantation as well. What the fuck? What? What? Honky on a plantation? And then they're like, well, your music must be good. No. It's pretty gay. Go on Irish country. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. To be fair, I guess, post-Skin Irish music is real bad. Yeah. No, Irish kids, they want to be... They want... Yeah. They need to be oppressed. Yes, that's true. The cranberries did you have to? Let it linger. Did you have to? I don't know the cranberries. You know the cranberries. Did you have to? Did you have to? Did you have to? Let it linger. The right slap. So... The start of the troubles is 1969. The NIR, the NICRA, then an Northern Irish civil rights activists, something that's founded. And there is a... So, where we'll leave the episodes is in 1969 in Derry, which is a heavily Catholic city... All London Derry, the perfect... Well, at this point, yeah, yeah. I don't actually know when it becomes London Derry in the eventacular, but let's say Derry for now. Yeah. And that's not me pinning my colours to a mast. I deliberately worn the grayer suit possible to try and not... If you wear a hint of orange, you're immediately committing. So, in Derry, there was a big protest in... I think it's August 69 against the state that Catholics find themselves in. Right. The RUC, which is the Ulster Conservancy, which are mainly Protestants and they've been a bit across over with loyalist stuff. They come in with batons and they basically start playing Wacomold with the Catholics. How many fuckers are there? So many fuckers. And it's... But also, this is known as the Battle of the Bogside, right? Because the Bogside... No, that's the... Bogside is anywhere in Ireland. You're honest. Or you haven't exactly narrowed it down, have you? Yeah, the troubles could just be called the Battle of the Bogside. No, the Bogside is the heavily Catholic area of Derry because it's near a bog. Well, there's so many bogs in Ireland and if you go to Ireland, what preserves any of their like pre-tuda history, right? Is anything found in a bog, right? Yeah. That's how anything is... Because there's so much bogs. Bogbodies, is the same. Bogbodies, bog butter, I think this thing. Look at bog butter, I'm pretty sure bog butter is... Bog butter, again, that sounds like a slur. This guy's bog buttering. Have you heard of this guy who's going J. Andrew and bog buttering? What is bog butter? Bog butter is an agent Wac she substance found buried in peaked bogs, particularly in Ireland and Scotland. Bog butter, is there not a more Irish? Is the two sides of being Irish? You have to take the butter in the bog. Do you know what I mean? There's the good and the bad with Irish. I can't believe it's not bog butter. So, as a little side note, a little teaser, I think we'll probably general what we'll do is next episode will start with the Battle of the Bogside. But this is Martin McGinnis's origin story. Right. The big, the hard man. This is just for the credits. This is... Yeah, he enters the scene. It's like the end of Rogue One, when not beta comes in. McGinnis is a young man in Derry, in the Battle of the Bogside. Bobby Sanders is still shitting in a toilet, but that will change. But at this point, this is for Martin Luther King, who's shitting himself. It's only when the stop clock is right twice a day in the 80s that he shits himself in prison, and he says it's for the Republican movement that everyone's like, oh, I guess he meant that. Bobby Sanders has IBS. And it's just trying to attach causes to make his shits mean something. The fucked bowel is right twice a day. Anyway. So, guys, thanks. In our next episode, Vittoria Angeloini will be here. Our first guest, and we're going to talk about the trouble. And we're going to tell him about the trouble. We're going to tell him, and he'll be here as to offer British perspective on drums. Now, that episode is already on our Patreon. Yeah. I think Vittoria's going to stick around, and we're going to do a Patreon bonus with him as well. Brilliant. So, if you want to sign up, you get early access, and there's ad free and everything. Brilliant. But either way, thanks very much for watching, listening, and we will see you next time. You",

      "episode": "12 Stephen Merchant.txt",
      "text": "Hello then, welcome to another edition of I Like Films with me Jonathan Rossin. Today, my guest here at my office is the brilliant comic writer, actor, producer and now director Steve Immurchen. Now all of us I think, especially in the UK, no Stephen Bess for his world with Ricky Gervais and the office and extras and they co-wrote and co-directed the film, a geometry junction together a few years back. Well this is his first solo project as a writer director and it's a movie which as we're about to find out came to him via an unusual source courtesy of Dwayne the Rock Johnson. The film's out now, it's called Fighting with my family and I can't recommend highly enough, it's a delightful and poignant as well as very funny kind of triumph of the underdog movie. I hope it's a massive success for him, it deserves to be and he is, of course, splendid company and sure about to find out. Stephen congratulations fighting with my family, just that now it's been cinema's everywhere, amazing reviews. You know the reviews in some ways are the sort of gatekeepers of these films which are not massive blockbusters, don't have a lot of, you know, if you Batman will sell himself but you know a movie about a family of wrestlers from Norwich, they're harder to pitch to the audience so the reviews is sort of the first, yeah, how did you say the first hurdle? But you managed somehow to get the biggest movie star in the world today to appear in the film and in the substantial and crucial part as well, you've got Dwayne the Rock Johnson. Well I wish I could like credit for the origins of this movie but it began with Dwayne, he was in, he was here in Lothar who's filming far so far as six, he was in a hotel room and he couldn't sleep and he was watching Channel 4 which is a lovely image to me just up Dwayne, he's in a hotel room, I assume it's the presidential suite of the global lodge and he's, you know, he's had the free shortbread and he's watching Channel 4, he never misses grand designs and on comes this documentary about this family of wrestlers from Norwich and he's from a wrestling background obviously, he's from a wrestling family and he kind of really responded to them and sort of fell in love with them and met up with his producer Kevin Misch, you could see that he was a kind of rocky style underdog story at the core of it, wanted a British writer, director and my name bubbled up and here we are. Did you know the Rocks on before? Did you know him? I did a film called Tooth Fairy. Of course you did but you are only a tiny role but a vital one. I mean the telling powerful, less we forget that movie involves Dwayne becoming the Tooth Fairy because he doesn't believe in the Tooth Fairy and he's doing that as a sort of punishment and who's his probation officer? The merch man. Weirdly that he's also based on a crew story. Exactly. So it comes your way and so what about it attracted you? You presumably you mentioned Rocky then, it's an undock thing, I'm Rocky is probably the finest example of that kind of a movie, were you a fan of that film? Well I love Rocky but I also I did not know anything about wrestling, I never really watched that, I would occasionally watch that seven is wrestling, British wrestling when it was World of Sports. Very different. If people's image of wrestlers is Ritt Dues like the Rock doing backflips, that was then with the physics of Darks players just sort of throwing punches that never landed. And even the televised version, it was normally in fairly grotty locales, it was kind of grimy hallways and you know people wouldn't take their overcoat off, it was a lack of permanence. Well you got the feeling that the rooms were very cold, that no one was putting the central heating on. So the old ladies, they would thwap the wrestlers with their handbags. I just love that for the old ladies. Yeah and it was the likes of Big Daddy and Giant Haystacks, one of the great wrestling names, because if there's one thing that strikes fear into other people it's some hay. Yeah. You try finding a needle in that way. That was all I knew about wrestling and so when this came along and they sent me the documentary, Dwayne and this producer, I honestly I sat down and thought oh god this is going to be hard work. And I just really fell in love with this family and that was what connected me to it, not so much the Rocky story but more this relationship between this family, they all wrestle. It's this thing which keeps them together, it's almost like growing up in a cult in which wrestling is the God. And then the core of it is this story, they wanted to get their kids into WWE, the big leagues of wrestling. And that of course is a big American thing. So they're watching that via sat like TV from here and it must have seemed like more or less an impossible goal. Absolutely and I think that's what it represented for them and what it represents in the movie is it's like making it in Hollywood or it's making it on Broadway, I mean it's as big as it gets and the daughter page got signed, the brother didn't and that was the hook for me, the fact that the brother who'd always assumed he was going to go off there and become a superstar didn't and he got and what do you do when you get left behind and that story of this sort of this sibling's getting torn apart by this family dream seemed like the real hook. But that is what I think gives the film it's kind of hard in a way, it's the fact that you then follow the both stories. You see his life going on without that chance for Stardom and Faming the field that he always thought was kind of sort of his entire life. He's for the taking, yeah. And her going out and then equally struggling, I mean not having it given to her and that I think really works well. We just go back to ITV Westing of the 70s briefies for a moment, there's something I want to share with you which is that and this is key to what I'm going to ask you and it's going forward which is the kind of the preordained nature of wrestling match. Yes, the kind of level of in which it is not necessarily an actual sport with no no now come. Lou Gray, the great Lou Gray, the impressoria who's ahead of ITV, he was asked to press conference ones. But Lou we want to know is the wrestling fixed and he took a path on his trademark so that I said well it is and it isn't. But it kind of eats the answer because on the one hand the athleticism and the skill and the sporting qualities that you look for and the excitement, that's for real. Well I still haven't quite got my head around it. I did a big deep dive into the research of this, hanging out with the family watching them wrestle, watching the American guys do it. It's a little bit like the magic circle in that you can be friends with the magician but they're not going to really give you any way to decide. Yeah, scoop and so although of course there's a lot of planning and in some ways there's obviously a lot of choreography to a degree. If you saw two wrestlers, if they came in here now and you said you need to do a match in three minutes time, they would have a 30 second conversation and then they would go in and improvise essentially. A 10 minute wrestling match and so the idea that it's all pre-ordered is not quite right because there's a lot of it's very strange, it's weird mix of sort of the actuality and showmanship, stunt work. Well it's seen as a form, it's like unscripted entertainment almost doesn't it? Right. But I guess the point is now one of the things that it relates to the film is because in the film one of the big kind of like the big grammatic climactic finale is will she succeed and it's not my moment and I was wondering whether how much of that legitimately was what happened or how much of that you massaged into the shape that you needed to make your narrative work as a film in that you know I'm not going to give away the outcome but but did she know stepping into it and had there been a discussion about how that match would play out because in the movie that clearly isn't what you give us. Well let's rewind for a second so the problem I had in the scripting was it suddenly struck me oh dear unlike Rocky where within the reality of the Rocky world when he punches a polo creed if he sends him to the mat it's a real punch and that the victory is a real win and it means something huge and as you say in wrestling the outcome is pre-determined so what is her victory going to be if you understand that there's some some element all-query in there. Some discussion has taken place beforehand and so that became a problem and but what was interesting to me were a couple things one was that the real girl told me when she had the experience of being in that ring when she finally got her opportunity for the big match in front of thousands of people millions watching at home the adrenaline of it when the outcome happened was as real to her as if she had won a gold medal at the Olympic Games. She had caught on a long journey to get there it was very very real and then the and then Dwayne told me something as well which is that the real victory of wrestling in terms of your career is do you win over the crowd not do you win the match but do the crowd are they one over to you when you get your opportunity on the on the big stage do the crowd take you because that's what keeps you at the top that's what makes you a star and so then it dawned on me well this is as much a star is born it's it's kind of gold diggers of 1930 it's 40 second street does the does the kid in the chorus like get their chance at the time in just in a kind of like purely kind of like very small weight that's not the issue the issue is did she succeed did she become that star that night exactly doesn't the fan yeah take to her and but at the same time what was interesting was in real life she had been told the outcome of the match and it she had been told by Dwayne and so we dramatized this scene where he talks to her backstage at wrestle maybe the night before he tells her we shot it so that Dwayne tells her the outcome and so the all our audience our movie audience would know what the outcome was of the final match and we shot it like that and we and we put that in front of a test audience and the test audience told us very clearly we don't want to know what the outcome is we want to watch it and enjoy it like it's a rocky match and so you know it's interesting that you know so you face the bit of a quandary that right and and actually it occurred to me that really how you you want to watch the end of this movie like if you were watching a wrestling match on TV you may know there's a predetermined ending but you don't know what that ending is that makes absolute sense yeah and it and it must have been I would have thought um I mean when you're having those test screenings and you're getting those cards back up the end a lot of directors I know a lot of what is they push back on that a little bit they don't welcome that process because it is to an extent you are perhaps being told if you look at this way well what you thought was right is actually wrong plus and you have to be I think fairly open to change it and presumably you were presumably you were quite relaxed about that well I went into the preview the test screening it was in it was deep in the valley in Los Angeles it was tested with an American audience first before we tested it with the British audience and incredibly nerve-wracking because I don't think people always realize they hear that the movies are tested but they don't necessarily know that you as the filmmaker sit in the back of the video yeah you're wet there you're there you are watching the reaction they don't know you're there and you're also having to sit there when they keep a handful of people back and they then have a Q&A afterwards and you and you know that idea you know people talk about imagine going to your own funeral and hearing what people talk about you I mean it could be like that we were lucky that the audience went for it and were on side so actually the the suggestions were not too cruel but one of the things that bubbled up was people questioning that sort of the ending. Were the suggestions they made which you chose to ignore? the bigger sense I think was the most useful thing was the ending and it was also about just pace and I think sometimes it's hard to know when you've made a point yeah and sometimes you can make the point too much or too strongly or sometimes not enough I guess because you've lived with that script and you know exactly what that moment meant to represent it in the now it's here. Well and what was tricky was I wanted to make a film that was for the wrestling fan but also the non-wrestling fan. For the non-wrestling fan you have to explain just enough that they know what's going on without boring them with lots of wrestling jargon and so that was a fine balance to get right. Putting the audience first and making sure the audience get it that's very much at the heart of I think the continued success of the lock himself I guess I mean I imagine and so he was involved as a producer on this was he involved and he was and he gave us feedback on script and on and he worked with our actors and he actually helped shape the resting matches themselves because I didn't realize this but even a resting match has a movie style three-act structure in which the good guy the baby face is kind of beaten down for the first two acts and then miraculously comes back to win love it yeah and so he helped us shape that stuff what I didn't want to do is although yes I wanted it to appeal to you know the rocks audiences it were I wanted to keep its Britishness and its authenticity and there were jokes which I knew weren't going to make much sense is a line where Nick Frost referring to someone's hair says it's like kissing an afghan meaning an afghan hang on like but I mean I think for Americans it's like kissing a person from afghan Nick Frost is amazing and it's amazing and it's amazing and the two kids are great and as well and I guess casting is a huge it's a massively important and I would have thought very difficult part of putting a film together well your particularly when it's real life people that you're building it on and the main girl page who had been resting since she was 13 and without giving too much away ultimately became very successful in America has enormous charisma has enormous talent and it's a great kind of showperson and so you needed someone who an actress she was willing to come in and sort of could do all of that who could convince you that she was a working class kid from Norwich and sort of carry a movie on her shoulders and I saw maybe 60 young people for that role it was very tough to cast and Florence who previously I'd seen in Lady Macbeth which is a much more contained you know role and a very different very different wrestling scene at the end of that for me correctly yes that's not weird right right right so it was very tough to cast but there is something very exciting when you're introduced to these new talents you haven't seen before they just electrify you and she walked out in front of 20,000 people on her third or fourth day of filming to recreate that match well and it was and she was about 90 when we shot it and she was just unbelievable I genuinely felt very invested in the family in in in those more parts of the performances but also the script I think is very very finely shaped and I really I really enjoyed the movie I mean I really felt the end and I kind of felt something with anger to you for manipulating my emotions of course these sort of films are quite manipulative I want that I'm proud of that because I like movies that do that to me I like being taken on an emotional journey I love it where I suddenly find myself choking up at the end of something and I think it's very hard to do and that's something I'm proud of about this film is that I think for most in terms of most audience reactions people get a little teary-eyed by the end and I think that's quite hard to do in a narrow and hard I think it is very hard and you succeed and this is your first solo directing as a film for a movie that's right yes yes how does that differ from previously I know you did cemetery junction with your vice and some various TV things yes so how different was it stepping out first time as a solo director I think the directing itself the mechanics of directing doesn't change dramatically from TV the big challenge and the thing where you miss having a collaborator like Ricky or someone else is you don't have that sounding board you know when you're working with someone as closely and who's taste you trust like Ricky you you you are making a lot of big creative decisions with each other and you sort of have there's a lot less angst in a way because it's a collaboration and it's a collaboration and although I'm surrounding myself with an amazing team and the DP and the producers are all great they all have slightly different agendas and so it's left to you to try and watch a scene like why isn't this quite working or is there something missing here and so you're you're sort of doing this extra leg work because I've written it as well to try and just cover every base because you don't want to get in the editing room and find oh that doesn't quite make sense whether it doesn't work or by the emotion and writing it on your own as opposed to with with the key to a so other people I mean that is once again I would have thought it lobs you off that second third voice it lobs you off the chance to bounce ideas from and feel confident that you've you have a consensus that you've arrived at the club right? Well I think it's that's the thing it's arriving at that consensus more quickly when you're working with a collaborator is what's tough when you're writing on your own because you're you know for instance the brother the real life brother told me this wonderful story about meeting his wife that was such an engaging story and for ages in the script I had this whole subplot about his his relationship with his wife and of course I couldn't ultimately fiddle that in and I think if I'd be working with a collaborator we'd have jetz and that much more early on but because I was sort of in my own head about this stuff I couldn't see the wood for the tree and presumably if you'd written it well and you like the way you'd written it I guess you don't want to sacrifice it. That's it that old phrase about kill your babies is so true and it's very hard to do that it's sometimes very hard to get the distance on what you've written which again a collaborator has you know I mean what's interesting is it's very well-directed I think it's not shall we at all you're unobtrusive in your duration style it's a meeting potato style which I like true of cemetery junction as well I think I mean you guys have never gone in and there's a couple of bigger shots in this and I guess you need that to capture the scope and scale of the arena but more often than not it's very focused you are not drawing attention to your princess over there what is a couple of reasons for that one is because my heroes are people at Billy Wadder who although incredibly talented filmmaker it is not someone who's overly showy and I and and so I like that style I don't I'm not such a fan of movies that constantly reminds you they are movies because so there's partly that but also you're telling us about wrestling which already has a lot of theater and artificiality and camp and showbiz and so to me if I then try and add a layer of sort of showy cinematography or or fancy moves or whatever on top of that for me I was worried it would take away from the realism of this family and of who they are and the kind of authenticity of their world which it was a very smart decision I think I mean it's interesting though because we think about it so often I find when I'm aware of the director's presence often I find that really irksome in a film I mean I was talking to Joe Cornish Caprius about the favorite and obviously you know some tremendous performances in that particular I live here Coleman but I didn't either way it was directly because I was almost constantly aware there was a director work what he uses those big fisheye lenses that are very and they constantly are reminding you there's a presence behind the camera and yet other times watching say touch of evil also most to give a really kind of really big example that opening sequence where you cannot be not be aware he's it didn't bother me as much yes although it's just easy because that although it's that one long tracking shot it there's so much going on and I think also it's probably one of the first times that was done and so it's showy but it always feels like it's in service of the of the story I think Scorsese is one of the few people that I feel like when he's showy it seems like it's somehow relevant to the story like he often will have characters who are you know Jordan Balfour in in Wolf of Wall Street who are kind of larger than life characters and there's something about the sweeping camera and the movement that Scorsese brings that seems to somehow be right for that story and Hans he's he's character on the screen rather than yeah it's interesting because when talentino uses it occasionally I find that annoying I mean like in in glorious bastards there's a shot where the young woman is about to set fire to the cinema spoiler and he shoots it from above really weirdly and then puts that conky David Bowie tracking from cat people and he like right it was a horrible moment for me completely destroyed the movie for me well go back to Billy Wadder I mean he he once said you know why would I put a camera behind the flames in a fireplace and shoot a living room scene from there I would never experience that moment from behind the flames of a fireplace and so I kind of I'm slightly of that opinion I don't want you to be mindful of me making clearer decisions behind the camera it's just for me it's naturally out of the reality of the world I imagine though partly this is also because you you you're approaching for it you wrote it so you're already in service to the script more than many directors might be well I think it's also a trade-off I in my experience is that there's always a trade-off between clever camera work and performance you have very limited amount of time this was a very low budget film we had very little time to prep the movie and if you want to focus on performance and you want to give the actress time to shine and try things out you there something has to give and one of the things that has to give is a clever you know tracking shot that starts you know one room and ends up somewhere else because the time the planning it takes to get that right is very time consuming and the actors have to get it right and that means that they don't get as much time to to play around it and so I take pride in the fact that lots of the kind reviews have been very complimentary about the performances and that's I hope because we gave them time to do their job I you and presumably you'll be directing more I mean is this but can you see the day when you you only want to be behind the camera because you're very good by the way Steve's in a very telling cameo in this film very funny not I'm once gonna feel a little cheated not wrestling sorry I mean did you consider putting on the pants and get them I've never skied I'm not gonna step in arresting very different discipline you'd be amazing imagine swinging those big arms in the wing no one could get close to you again I didn't even think about putting myself in it it was one of those things where I needed someone I think I'm one of the great reactors Jonathan I'm a terrific reactor even if you do say so yourself thank you very much and and I needed someone who could react to Nick and Lena being in areas and I know that what I'm here I'm on set I'm the right age I'll throw myself in or grow a creepy moustache and jump in but but to go back to your question about doing more one thing I have to say is I made a list recently because I got time on my hands and I'm a filmmaker of my favorite 500 movies oh that's a big list a big list and it's such a varied list with everything from my family I don't know how to do any movies why bother making a list of your favorite 500 movies there's only been 600 movies made in this in the world it was an easy list I just I want to see I want to see the 100 that didn't make the car but so it's such a varied list from sort of 60s art house movies to die hard and predator that I I feel like I'd be happy to make any one of them and so I kind of feel a bit like I don't know where to go next that's an interesting challenge to face that because presumably and this will I think do well I mean you know you made it with a small budget you have some big stars in it some amazing performances and it's a great story and once again I can say it's all genuine is I found enjoyed it I hope you do go and see this film but you will be offered more work I would have thought and so I guess the challenge is what do you do next what do you actually want to do you know in all seriousness do you know what I've been offered to other scripts other wrestling movies of course I mean that's the wrestling guy now that's a that's a weird whoever thought you never thought you'd be the rest the go-to guy for wrestling the go-to guy for wrestling so you're going to do something very different I make and I'm making it won't be a kind of a triumph of the underdog kind of feel next I don't think it will and I and I but I don't honestly don't know where to go because I would love to do a genre movie in an action movie or a thriller but I would love to do a small sort of intimate art movie I'm sort of fan of all of it really and and so I'd like you know I'm my hope is that I'm still making films at the age of 85 like Clint Eastwood or someone and I've done a bit of everything along the way and our word from our sponsors Thaver is a simple blood test you do at home it's a finger prick blood test that allows you to track your health

future use the code film 50% off thank me later I imagine character will come first for you in whatever you do next because in a way that is what attract you to this it wasn't the absolute that's still I think the thing which I have to engage with I want to care about the characters in the world and like I said I'm less interested in movies that are kind of referencing other movies or that are a comment on other movies that seems rather self-adulgent to me I like stuff which has an emotional core and controls you in it's interesting because the way you signal is at the moment it does seem to be harder to get I mean it's fine if you keep into a micro budget but it's harder to get things made which don't have a big selling point already you mentioned Batman earlier on and Batman a Batman movie even under the last few Batman appearances on screen they've been in terrible movies I mean fairly almost objectively I think one could say that but they continue to make a lot of money because he's a brand name that will go around the world and so that's why they're safe making those kind of films and if you were launching something else it is tough to get a larger budget so I guess you are going to stay in the immediate future in the fairly kind of like small to mid-range it's a shame isn't it that there's not that that mid-range movie that used to be made I'm thinking of things like Shawshank Redemption or those kind of I guess now they'd be sort of 40 to 60 million dollar films that were sort of prestige enough that they might get good critical notices and perhaps even some awards but that they had a populist appeal is one and they don't really go for those movies anymore I mean someone like Clint Eastwood can make them but or Ben Affleck but on the whole they don't make those movies because they're sort of they're not a they're not a surefire they move to TV that's right that's the thing and and so I wonder there is that something where we might see I mean I know it's a bigger in a way a bigger commitment and you don't have to direct every episode of course but are you thinking about TV I mean I want to mean TV I mean like HBO TV I mean Netflix TV rather than you know channel 4 grand designs well I would like I would like to do that and actually you know there's also a lot of good movies that are made for TV but there's something about you know as I was saying them a lover like you there's something about making a film which is projected on a big screen in a room where people have come out and they grouped together in the dark to watch it there's there is something satisfying about that and there's something satisfying about telling a story in 90 to 100 minutes you know having done a lot of TV it's a much more it's a different skill set in a way and although yes you get more time to unfold the world and the characters there's a challenge that's satisfying about taking someone on an emotional journey in an hour and a half that that seems very interesting to me but often as well I find more and more with these big TV series is that often that that privilege or that kind of is abused or perhaps it's misused in the service of keeping making more content for less money you see a lot of TV said where you think okay this is just dragging on there's a lot more talking than it's necessarily it and that's because that's cheap well I also it never occurred to me when I was younger and it really until I started working in this business that of course the reason there's 10 series of friends is not because that's the best way to tell that story it's because they want to keep it on the air because it makes money and you forget of course it's in their interests to make more and that's not necessarily the best way to tell a story and people talk about well season five wasn't as good but hang on if we look at this in a different way and I'm not blowing smoke up your the backside here but the American office I mean the English office was great of course the American office who knew that would be as good as it was going to be and that took it off in a whole new direction and that didn't feel to me like it ever outside it's welcome I guess they would have carried on making them if everyone had agreed right they're probably wisely you know but they managed to do that and that and that that's that's remarkable yes but it's not that's not an easy thing to do and they and I in a weird way Steve Carell leaving was a great loss to the show but it opened up new characters and it led them to kind of perhaps refresh things in a different way yeah yeah and so comedy though I mean there is comedy in in fighting with my family but at the same time it's essentially it is a kind of heartwarming it's a kind of an emotional film it's a character based film but comedy I always you know you're obviously very good at comedy that comes out with a full fairly easily to you really yeah I still got to work on it and so yeah so that that something I think everyone would like to see you involved in a kind of full-on Adam Sandroesque comedy movie I would quite like to do a sort of balls out broad knock about comedy I just teach party or something like that right I just I just for whatever reason I I've never had quite the right idea for it they need to have very big concepts those kind of movies and I don't tend to think in big concepts I am more drawn to characters and I think the problem is I feel like I would end up wanting to to stop the laughs and try and make you cry or have some drama I don't I don't know I just I think be more fun perhaps to be in than to perhaps actually rhyme direct and is it is it fun acting in when you like when you made tooth fairy for example here's that's something where you're cogging a fairly large industrial style scale Hollywood machine that's that's a fun way I guess there's kind of less less on your mind when you go back to your hotel woman I guess you can see that's definitely true the pressure is off in that regard but I I don't know I like I did Logan and I was in matches Mississippi and I was in this tiny town and everyone was filming nights and I was there because they kept me on standby in case they needed me for a scene but that scene was never really on the schedule it was never planned it just it's a big movie they can keep you there and so Richard E. Grant and I were rattling around this tiny town in Mississippi going out of our brains we were it was it was so interminable and I know everyone thinks oh how privileged are there's people who got a dig ditches for living I can clearly understand that but indulge me this winch for a second we're in this hotel we don't see anyone else we know because they're all shooting nights when we're asleep they're working and vice versa every restaurant in matches of which there's two closes at 8 p.m. the coffee shop that only opens on a Tuesday as far as I can tell there is nothing to do it is the middle of summer it is sweltering hot the one hotel has no room service so can't even order a club sandwich and we went out of our minds it wasn't we therefore in this we were there for two and a half weeks there was never a chance of me being needed because my makeup job took three and a half hours and they were waiting in case there was some rain they were going to use me well it was never going to rain in the summer in matches for more than about 30 seconds yeah by the time they'd called me in and done the makeup the rain would have stopped and I knew this and so hang on hang on you're wearing makeup in that film I thought that was just you with the bed off I just showed you just shaved my hair and there was one night where we went we found out there was a pub quiz very exciting Richard and I we went to this pub quiz and I was so looking forward to it was like something to do and we get there and me and Richard were on a team I don't want to discrede the people of matches but there was just two of us and every other team had about 10 people and we were joint first there was a tiebreaker question and the tiebreaker question was how many people survived the sinking of the Titanic Richard by this box so angry that he was still in matches didn't even discuss with me the answer wrote something down on the piece of paper handed it in it was wrong we lost the quiz I didn't speak to him for two days wow I was furious we were like a married couple it was crazy that's intense what is the correct answer to that do you know I can't remember it's more than do you think oh yeah I mean I should imagine it is but I mean that's that it's sad that's what I took away from the stories I know just one of them oh no the answer is in case it comes up in a quiz yeah are you a big quiz I love a quiz yeah I love a quiz too I bet you're quite good I'm all right I always assume I'm better than I am but I match she that's why I privilege for you right there hey but here's the thing because you didn't study a proper course at universities that's why you don't have a breadth of knowledge because what did you say you studied some sort of film or media television you say books yeah that's not leisure pursuits it essentially is I mean should that be allowed I would hope they've they've stopped that now yeah you're just you've wore it because it was not a real course is there anything from that course which you have used in your glittering career let me think well I think they probably gave us some quite good stuff about structure sort of film structure yeah I remember that introduced us to feminist film theory and things like the the Bechtel test male guys as well male gaze and things like that so that was all good but I remember one of the first lessons they gave us a still from a movie and we had to write a very detailed essay on the composition of the frame and why the director reduced that lighting and that composition and as I've done movies you realize how rare it's really that carefully planned maybe aways Anderson film but actually so much of what is in the frame is what you managed to grab on the day yeah that's the clock was ticking I remember it does I think it was an interview with Kurosawa someone says to him why did you compose the frame in this way and he says well because if you pan left there's a hotel if you pan right there's a gas station you know that's the thing you discover once you start making these things it's so much of it is as people say you're making gone with the wind in the morning and you're making home in a way in the evening you mentioned Kurosawa one of my favorite directors of all time amazing and I think I've seen almost all of his films there's one one very early film with Johnny exists I think about 40 minutes of it and I haven't traveled myself to watch that yet but I can imagine there's one one of his only moves I don't know how many you're a big Kurosawa fan I would say I sort of moderate Kurosawa I haven't seen everything as much as you've seen high and low I think I've seen high and low but you probably haven't seen red be it so there's a very early Kurosawa movie I think it's just three war or during the walk one wonderful Sunday which I only watched recently in amazing film I urge you to seek it out I'll see if I find my DVD of it but what's interesting about it and I could see and I'm thinking someone should remake this or someone should use this a template for new movie and I'd love you to see it because it's about basically a very poor young couple who are getting together who can't and don't want to take their racies and they're still looks they can't afford a place of their own and they have this day it's just this one day and some good things happen some terrible things happen over the course of this one Sunday that's amazing but it's a moment in it of such startling modernity in which one of the characters I want to spoil it for you is addressing a sort of she imagines an audience there and she's talking to the audience about their life but of course she's staying straight to the camera so she's talking to us as the audience it's a it's a powerful powerful moment I'd love you to see it but I can imagine someone and it's the sort of thing I can imagine you taking into a new you know so maybe that's where you should look it's interesting that because you know one of the ways of getting movies made now is if it's a remake because it reassures people that the story works and it wasn't it yeah absolutely but it's you know but they generally like to remake movies that everyone's already heard of which seems perverse to me or I shouldn't say that no one's not the people haven't heard of this but I mean a film which is less well known to the modern audience and so I'm looking for I keep looking and digging around to see is there something that could be remade that perhaps is less familiar than just simply remaking ghost but well another Scorsese and not not Scorsese another co-star movie which Scorsese had the rights to is high and low which I reckon is even amazing kidnap drama and with the one period Mel Gibson was attached and of course we're all pleased that didn't happen but uh but you know I mean I I would see as being something as well as a writer being slightly less daunting than sitting down just with the blank page I think so I thought although I think what would unnerve me is that the surely the critical knives will be out for anyone remaking carousel not very few people are seeing that movie I only really mentioned it to show off what it's done is impress me and so you don't you genuinely don't know what you're doing next but presumably thanks to the office you've got enough money not trust a while that's the great privilege thanks to those um ten seasons or whatever of the American office but uh but yes but at the same time I you know I think I'm also a little bit um this one has taken a long time and it took a lot of time and energy and I think you know I was thinking of the day I think I started this in 2014 and I've obviously not been working on it every day but I think in terms of the money I've been paid for this movie I reckon per hour I have made less money than the cleaner who's the star of Roma well I think that character is getting a better wage than I am so I feel like it next time I can't spend this much time I've got I think I've just got to jump in and try not something out in six months you know and be one of those filmmakers that just keeps turning it out I don't think you will though Stephen I think you'll find that you won't be able to do that I don't want to be the cube rick who's waiting kind of now and now it's between things even no one's going to ever compete who by the way I think I've waited oh okay that needs to uh no I don't I don't four great movies lots to enjoy in all of them though wouldn't you say yeah but but four great what's the four that you're gonna need I would say Barry Lyndon yeah I would say 2001 yeah I would say clockwork Orange yeah I would say the shining okay you wouldn't put strange love in there no okay no fair enough I certainly wouldn't put eyes wide shine there right no what about his version of the leader yeah it's okay but you know what as a film I mean I love the film I love it but I don't think it's a great film and I think it's a kind of almost down film film it's one of my favorite books yeah yeah yeah so you think that's not a bad that's not a bad no no you only made about 12 films or whatever that's not a bad exactly lazy that's the problem with where's I'd put the only above him I would certainly put Kursana above him I'd probably put Scorsese above him oh definitely I think Scorsese has

or as a officer of still on I love first blood amazing it's terrific I I mean enormous fan of cop land good film that's James Mangal I like cliffhanger really I like cliffhanger although I haven't seen it for a long long time yeah watch it again and then we'll chat I like quite a lot of the Rockies I like Rockies one and two three is fun four is mental five's not right dreadful rocky vibe I was solid oh I love rock and both the creed films are pretty good what about the last of the the rainbow films that one I was in the chefano you didn't wear that say why because it was too blood thirsty for me oh there's people's heads being carved and there's such a thing there's two blood I can I do it with my age or something I don't I don't even have kids but I can't watch gruesome violence so you would rather watch a film with aliens are being killed if you want that kind of level of yeah to pull I think yeah but I've never been a Gore horror movie fan that's I what I do is I remember years ago when I was young I was watching with a bunch of teenage friends the Texas Chainsaw Massacre and it's starting to get very scary and so what I do is I just gently move my glasses down my nose so that I because I'm very short-sighted I couldn't see it because you have even just a blur so it appeared that I was still watching the film so didn't look like I was a coward today that's a nice thing to do because you didn't make them feel awkward that they had imposed this kind of unpleasant experience on you you were still part of the group yeah and yet you made it save yourself from that but have you changed into not just in terms of aging you say you haven't got kids so that hasn't been a factor but obviously partly as you grow all do you change these but also the climate around us has changed drastically I mean I find now that I will watch movies often I'll put on a movie just because they're like the fashion or the cars or the streets of that period so I watch the 1970s Italian horror film for example and now I will find it problematic and difficult to watch the kind of wholesale slaughter and the kind of like almost sexualized killings to go on yes I mean the women in that period which previously 15 20 years ago I would not have questioned that's right that presents so partly the changes in the world around us to change your taste as that happened to you as well yes definitely and actually I've watched a number of movies that I love and which are classics in my mind with my girlfriend who is in her mid 30s and so she's you know she's not you know she she's seen a lot of films but yeah I watched with her Billy Wadders the apartment which I love but it's tricky watching it now because it's dealing with the misogyny of those men in that office and it's dealing with that the kind of treatment of women at that time where secretaries are sleeping with their bosses and so on and so it and it's aware of it's not it's not celebrating that but it's nevertheless it's difficult to watch it's not celebrating but it isn't it isn't sort of a critical it's critical it's criticizing it as much as you would today that's right that sweet charity what sweet charity I've got my kids to watch sweet charity because I'm a big Bob Fossie fan and my daughter then was kind of furious with me she said you made me watch all that film just so that ginger woman could go off unhappy at the end right yeah that I mean it's not the most succinct review of sweet charity obviously but she has a point you know sure and then and it's much more noticeable than you think that particularly gratuitous nudity back in the day I mean I remember I remember sort of becoming aware of that perhaps even before this current climate I remember watching a double bill of weekends burn is we can never bring his one and two wow and we can burn his two let's be forget for those on exactly from the moment we can it burn his one so it's but it's basically one long film it's one long film and we can it burn is to um burnie your remember is a dead body uh he's dead and they tried to pretend he's still alive in the first one in the second one they need to ramp things up a bit so burnie is brought back to life through voodoo and although he's essentially a zombie he's now kind of a voodoo curse brings about now he kind of walks around Frankenstein style and anyway there's a moment where burnie gets his foot caught on a sort of one of those kind of beach gliders that you see and he's dragged a longer beach and he gets dragged across to um sunbathing women and he pulls off their bikinis and they jump up and you see their naked boobs um and I just was watching that even as a young man thinking wait those actresses they had they had to agree to that and also that that where they found their parents he's going you know we can burn his we can burn his two oh no and it's just and he realized oh my god they just wouldn't hopefully you wouldn't even you hope that would be a conversation it's amazing that it took a kind of a lot of attention being focused on the awfulness of that it's extraordinary to wake up to it absolutely it's it's crazy and that you think even back in days of the swini yeah they'd kick a door in and there be a girl with her yeah top of no other reason here's a treat it was kind of a thinking but now you heard it here first we can't at burnies three from Stephen merchant any day now I imagine any day but burnie is burner dead it's a woman this time yeah that's the way to do it but are you aware of that because obviously there's a lot going on a moment a consequence of the me two movement but partly also just the kind of lack of representation of women behind the camera there's a movement to get more women producing white directing there's also a move to get more people of coloring on there and I guess as a white man in history in a way this is the worst time for you to be jumping you know and not that we're trying to make some great case and make some great plea for sympathy here but there there you must be there's an awareness of that there was certain projects that you couldn't throw your hat into the ring for that's right and yes I'm certainly not going to say oh woe is me you know I have I've had a good run and and and and and and I think it's sort of it's like you were saying what we're just saying then about the gratuitous nudity is it's not until you know as someone who is a white heterosexual middle class middle-aged man you don't realize how much is absent from the screen and behind the camera until someone points out you because you're always seeing yourself and so you're not as aware of what is absent until people start pointing out and it's absolutely shocking and and I'm as guilty of not recognizing that as anyone although I am quite proud of the fact that you know we have a very strong female protagonist at the center of our movie yeah um I mean it wasn't that we were trying to jump on a band I can actually began before a lot of that conversation was happening it was simply that hers seemed like a great story to me and so I I hope that just recognizing that this was an interesting tale um was the sort of that was reason I did it rather than thinking I must do something that is a sort of gender specific story and it doesn't come across that way either actually didn't feel like you're trying to do I mean it's certainly doesn't feel like band-reg and jump anywhere I mean to really to really lovely and emotionally a moving film about a group of great characters and I love the fact that you it's kind of obviously it's framed comically but the you are you are kind of brutal and straightforward in your presentation of them as a group of people who in many uh films society would see them as being the problem right not something to be celebrated well I think I don't whether you were familiar with page before this movie but here is a working class woman from a working class family in Norwich who has gone all the way to the top of her particular showbiz profession of resting and I had never heard of her and as I did my research there were no broadsheet profiles of her and her success she was this sort of anonymous success story that we if you like in our kind of you know liberal London media bubble had not identified and fun enough she had been celebrated in in the tabloids in the sign and things you know uh and it's just sort of interesting there's a lot of inherent snobbery and we are rightly celebrating people like Olivia Coleman for her Oscar and she is amazing she had nearly appeared of course in the office so i'm not giving it a thank you but you know we celebrate her and as we should but but at the same time there's this working class girl who's in wrestling and because of perhaps some snobbery towards that or because she's this kind of brash goth girl she'd been overlooked and now hopefully in some small way that has been uh dealt with and been we'd rest Steven love it spend some time with you thank you so much for coming over here to my glorious office which I know you've been admiring I have absolutely I wish people could see this do you is there any kind of online footage but a photo of our phone but it is it's partly a marvelous place and it's partly uh I think an outward sign of my mental illness and you think I think can you do that thing where uh you could sort of film it from all angles and then you can build a thing on the line where people could wander around your a museum room and see it because there's a lot of them wander around my psychoses yeah what is the impulse behind all this Jonathan is it you know it's a stunted adolescence it's part you know what it is it's it's a youthful deprivation and the feeling of entitlement that grew with me and therefore I bought everything I felt I should have been given as a child but sadly was not yeah that's it in a nutshell it is I mean does look basically like you spent a lot of time in a in a lot of um Japanese car boot sales I spend a lot of time on Japanese auction sites do you collect anything records I guess but I know how to go vinyl but not not as pathologically as I used to I used to keep concert tickets in a draw and I have another thing but I remember thinking him probably in my younger in my 20s like oh this is going to impress a woman one day I realized as I got older no woman has ever said Steve you know time about the concerts you've been to oh I went to see you know well ACES here and David Bowing here okay great well I'm gonna sneak me there but only if you've got some kind of evidence of this well thank you come to this shoebox and I will show it uh we're tragic family we just it's all for really don't count me in your eye I put that's not too no I've I've put aside my childish things I kept a hat kept a handful of annuals and comic books from my youth but I certainly haven't built like a shrine to them wow that's some tough tough tough love well is it love there was some tough hate coming my way Stephen thank you thank you there you go I hope you enjoyed me chatting there with Steve a merchant as I said the film fighting with my family it's out right now and it's great fun please do go and see it thank you to Jess Kerry and Amanda for helping us sort out this interview thank you of course to Steve him for giving us this time and thank you for listening remember if you haven't done so already please press subscribe and we'll keep making more I like films just for you",

I'm here with Horatio Gold. Today we're talking about the Cuban Missile Crisis. The Cux war. Would you say so? Yeah. This is a war for people who don't want to actually get involved. No. They just like to pay for some from the third world, do do it. Yeah. So can you put this in context for Alice's at home? It's not ever on the news. You have to assume that the people are obviously completely sick of us. Yeah. So the Cuban Missile Crisis is the early 60s. So this is after World War II. But before Lizo started presenting on news round. Okay. Yeah. So in that kind of gap, before Lizo really comes to prominence, Lizo was not reporting on the Cuban Missile Crisis. Yeah. And they wouldn't, if you said... Well, they did report on 9-11, which is quite funny. Did they? When news round had to do something about 9-11. So is news round for kids? Yes. So what was it? And then open wide. A bunch of kids tried to eat their dinner. So yeah, if you spoke to Kennedy or the average American, they would have, they wouldn't have a clue who Lizo was with they. No. No. Yeah. They have no idea. They wouldn't even know what news round is. Well, I think British news round is sort of the equivalent intellectual of a lot of American, I don't use channels. Sure. Yeah. But anyway, there are three major characters in this story. Yeah. There's John F. Kennedy, American president. The horniest president there's ever been. Well, your hornest president has ever been. But then you see the family comes from. It's Catholic. You know? Yeah. It's Catholic. He's got about 15 brothers and sisters and they're all shagging. His dad was the horniest man in life as well. Really? Yes. I think that was almost just like, yes, so John F. Kennedy's dad, I forgot his name. He was constantly cheating on JFK's mom. Really? And they all knew about it. He would literally be like, right, sorry, I'm going to pop out for a bit. I'm going to go cheat on your mom. Yeah. See you later. And he just couldn't stop cheating. So JFK is almost like the way that JFK was cheating. It felt like he just literally thought that's what a man does. Just you just fuck everyone. You have to. But he makes, John F. Kennedy makes Bill Clinton look like Greta Thunberg. He's just fucking everyone. He's like Greta Thunberg's the least horny person. I think I'd say so. Yeah, yeah, she's not cheating on the planet. I guess. The planet with any human relations. You have stolen my future. Greta, she's super sweet 16s. That's the worst ever episode of that show. Yeah. Greta, we've got you a car. There's big. You know, big. You know, you're performing at your own, it's even 16. She's fucking hate. Big daddy with all that oil, he's bringing up. Yeah, yeah, that's true. I wonder what she would find. What do you think? If Greta Thunberg, if we solved climate change, do you think she would be? She'd find another thing to bang on about. I don't think. Do you think she'd be upset? Yeah, yeah. I think if like, if let's say Elon Musk just comes up with this new thing, solves everything. That'd be funny. I think people would be annoyed. Yeah. Because think about Extend to Rebellion, all of that lot. Yeah, what do they do now? If it was solved, they would be like, nah, because that machine actually uses this rare kind of like strain of like limseed oil that we, is destroying the planet, they'll definitely keep pushing, I think. But yeah, JFK, even during the Cuban missile crisis, he was like, he was very stressed, obviously, to be fair to him, one of the stressful times ever. Well, no, we're not shipping in women still. Yeah, well, the, so we'll get to this obviously, but he doesn't actually get told about the missiles on the night they arrive. Right. Because he is fucking a prostitute in the White House. Ah. And so I actually think he always gets credited for like, keeping a clear head during, you know, saving humanity with the plan. When you think about it, if you think of post-nut clarity, yes, this guy had the emptiness balls of any man that's ever lived. Right. So he could, he was in Matrix. So then I don't know if cruise chef, cruise chef was quite committed to his wife. I don't think cruise chef has ever got his end of way. No, I mean, his wife was quite a taskmaster, cruise chefs. And they're like a very committed long-term relationship. Definitely sex left that relationship 30 years ago. So he, you can, and he's bold as well, which means he's horny and there's more come inside him. That's the fact, isn't it? Well, the more bold you are, the more testosterone you have, the more horny you are. That's why hair pills make you less horny. But the more hair you have, the less horny you are. Well, JFK didn't have any come inside him because he couldn't possibly produce enough to keep up with demand from all the women he was fucking. Yeah, exactly. cruise chef is the opposite. And actually JFK stands out in the story because he's the one person in the Cold War who's, who's not fuck ugly. Yeah. Everyone else is, and that's why it's called the Cold War. Yeah, that's supposed to be the fucking hot war. Yeah. Fucking hot war. Yeah. Because everyone, I mean, if you get a Charlie, you get a photo of Brezhnev, who I think comes a bit later. This man is, there's a photo of him meeting Mal and it's one of the ugly, it's one of the ugly things of the ugly things I've never seen. Yeah, Brezhnev, if we're ranking Soviet guys, yeah, Brezhnev. Oh my god, look at that. That's Nixon. Nixon's hardly a look at that. No, Nixon's not good, lucky. My Nixon lost that debate with Kennedy when Kennedy was running because he was ugly. Because he was like, look at this guy. Fuck me. That's ugly. Yeah. Right, if we're doing it, can you get Gorbachev up? This is what I mean, the cold, this why it's the Cold War. And Gorbachev, the ugliest of all Russian Premiers, I think, that's a, that's a tie. Let's come up. 100%. You think there's an ugly one, the Gorbachev. I think Brezhnev, let's take a look at this. Are you telling me? You don't, you have a, I don't want to. Okay. I, I, I, I, yeah. He was so ugly he had to end the Cold War. That's what, that's the point, it's because it's mutually short destruction. I mean, no, American could get uglier than that. But he's saying that Russia actually won the Cold War. Yeah, but it was ugly off. That's what the Cold War was. The American's looked to go up to him when, okay, you win. There's no way we can compete with that. So having JFK makes America pretty vulnerable in the ugly wars, right? Yeah, he's on the ropes. He's, because they've got this hot piece of ass who's fucking everyone in the white house. Yeah, but JFK was so horny. It was almost like he was sort of humping the air and his aid would kind of put him. What's the way he was humping intermittently? It's sort of scattered around. He's constantly fucking. He's like a wind-up doll that's fallen out. But if he falls out, he's just, they have to put him back up and stick prostitutes there. Yeah, that's right. That's like that. That's not what you're going to do for your country. Like, no, not that. Okay. Yeah, so it's amazing, but this is kind of seen as his finest hour. But again, I think that's because he had more clarity of thought than anyone ever. Yeah, we're not going to be him getting shot in the head, is it? I don't think he got shot in the head. I think his head exploded because he had to sit next to his wife for six hours. That's what I think. Well, because he was on camera for so long, he couldn't shoot on his wife for more than... Yeah, so he was just there. And he said, just... That's my theory. I mean, we're doing episodes. Well, there's a lot of theories. Yeah, we're doing episodes in the jazz class, isn't it? There's Madder conspiracy theories in that, I think. But James Cage also got... He saw a pair of tips in the grassy knoll. He's not the grassy knoll. Looks like one tip. Yeah, that's it. Oh, like a man. And he just had exploded. Yeah. So he was also there with his brother, Robert Kennedy, was a big part of this as well. He was another Kennedy. He was also assassinated. Yeah, he was assassinated. Take a warning. You know, Robert Kennedy's brother. Yeah. Do you know if he was horny? He sounds, they all sound horny, and then Robert Kennedy's son is RFK Jr. Yeah, so RFK's nephew is now the health secretary, even though he sounds like... Make America. Make America. And the unhealthiest man in the world. Oh, I'm gonna say, you guys stop eating your food. I live a worm in my brain that's driving me to make these joints. It's like Ratsatouille, but with the worm, that's kind of RFK's life. I do have a soft spot for RFK, even though all the man's shit, I just... He's so ripped. He's so ripped. He only excises in jeans. Yeah, yeah. So we sort of very... I guess that's one result of the cold war being over, is that now you have Americans excising in jeans, which is a very rushing thing. Yeah, yeah. Look at guys. Look at this. Look at that. But it works. You can't deny it. Right, yeah. And what I like about RFK is he's a new type of guy. I don't know if there's ever been a guy like this. Like, he's not... This is not a type of guy. There's not a type of guy who's like a ripped guy with that voice whose brain's been driven by a worm who keeps pet ravens who like eats roadkill. Like, we've never seen this type of guy before. Bobby Kennedy, so his dad, he had a... He had basically a zoo on his house. He kept like every animal possible. He was like, um, fucking Pablo Escobar, essentially. So there's probably way he got it from the old raven thing. Well, yeah, this is what happens when you're... When every single member of your family gets assassinated. Yeah. You either get killed or you end up like this. It's really long enough to become a fucking mentor. You're the one in the entire family. But JFK, so JFK is, um, elected in 1961, I want to say. Yeah, I think that's right. That is right. That sounds right. And it's been Eisenhower for 10 years. Who's... Again, fuck ugly. Fuck ugly. So they good start for America. Yeah, so the Cold War starts strong for America. Yeah. Eisenhower, get a photo Eisenhower up. Look at him. Bug. Absolutely. He was like, maybe this is a... Me thinking, I think I wouldn't mind being president in the 50s for America. That feels like you can do an autopilot, right? I think that's the best time has ever been. It's after I wore two before... If you're white or an a man. An a man. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Which we are. Which we go to that thing. But yeah, if I was, um, sort of like there's electric self-driving cars being president in the 50s, I'd say. Being a white guy in the 50s. Basically a self-driving car. Yeah, you can be on the motorway at sleep. Yeah, yeah. You can just have a blanket. Yeah. If I wouldn't mind doing that, I think I could do a pretty good job just doing that. Yeah. And guys just keep doing what you're doing. Brilliant. Oh, there's a career, I guess, wasn't it? It sends some mentor career. Oh, yeah, that was pretty. Ah. Yeah. We weren't involved in that. Or maybe we weren't. No, we weren't involved in that one. I think we were. But I don't know. Yeah. But anyway, that, but autistic dad has never talked about it. So it feels like we weren't that involved, didn't it? Well, yeah, we were probably involved about it. Then British guys would be boring you at Christmas. Which stories. But also it's too far away. I mean, my dad took, has taken me to Omaha Beach. Me and my sister, I was 12. She was nine. She gave us a backpack full of rocks and he timed us running off the beach. And I must stress that no one in my family was involved in the day landings. He just wanted to see what it was like. Were you going to do a stoning at the end? I think so. Yeah. I think if I beat my sister, I got to stoning her, I think. My dad's a very conservative little man. I should stress. But he's also fascinated by World War II. Anyway, so Kennedy comes into office in 61 and he's hot. He's very rich boy. And this guy, Fox. That's what the F stands for. Don Fox. Don Fox Kennedy. And he has very rich. Well, he's in like a political dynasty or they live in this sort of compound of kind of rich Catholic horny people, right? Yeah. He's got to talk to the drug. But you can say Catholics. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, makes sense. And he saw you places Eisenhower. And but he inherits this problem with... Yeah, I do feel sorry for him a bit here. Because it is Eisenhower's mess, right? Well, Eisenhower's gone like, yeah, we're going to fucking invay Cuba. Which we should pause and talk about Cuba. Yeah. Cuba. Cuba. Cuba. Cuba. Cuba. Is that Trump? Yeah, I think he said Cuba once. Yeah. China. In Cuba. I don't really know much about it. What the Cuban revolution? No, I mean, the country. The summer doesn't have to stop me making your opinion on it. But I know that it's got like two things in the supermarket and a good healthcare system. A good healthcare system? Yeah. To the actually. Yeah, so it's got for like the third world as the best healthcare. But you can only you can only buy bread and... It's sort of the trade off with the communism stuff. Yeah, I see. So you get like you get no choices in the supermarket. But there's what? But you can see a GP. Right. Like that day. Yeah. But there's one type of car. Yeah. Yeah. So that's kind of like trade off. Yeah. And but Cuba's not like that before. No, it's very unequal. But one of the richest in Latin America for some reason, I mean. And then there's a revolution in the late 50s Yeah. Where... Videa cat. Hey, Videa. Hey, Videa. Hey man, Capron. Yeah. Eth\u00e9. Is that what keep us on us? Yeah, yeah. Hey man, hey man. Anfidea cat, don't man. Sort of getting a bit narrow there. Hey man, hey man. Yeah. I got a takeover Cuba. Yeah. Um, smokes, smokes big fags. Yeah. Love spusting fags. Yeah. Only wears green. Yeah. Neckbeards. Yeah. Um, him and... He's pretty horny as well. He's got a dream of... He's, uh, he would stay in the Hilton Havana, I think, all like. Yeah. And that's where his dream of women would be. And with the many plots on his life, uh, they would try and go through the endless women he fucked. Look at this, I mean, come on. So this is it, it's, uh, it's a real horny often. He... Yeah. He's giving JFK a run for his money. So Ken, he's like, we've got to take this guy out because he's fucking... He's fucking... I can't have that. Yeah. Um, but no, Cuba's, uh, socialists. Yeah, but come socialists because of a revolution. Which apparently Shay Guevara helped with. What are your views on Shay Guevara? Uh, I don't really, I mean, there's the... I don't like people... There's people. I don't like people who wear the t-shirt. What's funny is my dad used to have the t-shirt. Really? So my dad, like, biggest captain, step-or-right. Uh-huh. Just like the t-shirt as well. Yeah. Which I think is kind of what Shay Guevara has become. Which is quite funny. Yeah. This is the most capitalist thing, but he's basically, uh, the sales t-shirt. Yeah, it's like a, yeah. It's like an I love London t-shirt. It's having Shay Guevara just because of the vibe. Yeah. But, you know, there's a photo as well. Yeah. And it's just, but it's one of those things. It's like, you just want to get killed before you can do anything bad. Oh, yeah. If he lived, if he'd lived, if he'd lived up and off, lived up and off, lived up and off. Like if Eminem got killed after his third album, everyone would say it was the best rapper of all time. To go. Yeah. But then he keeps pumping it out. He's so fucking alive. Yeah. Yeah. He did one recent album, which everyone hated, and then he immediately reached another album saying, I know that one was bad, but this one's great. And everyone thought that was shit as well. It's just, I wish it had. If you had a drive by shooting, it would have absolutely saved you from Rio Eminem. Nightmare. Anyway, so Kennedy and Heret's a plan for Mizenhow to invade Cuba, because they're like, we can't have these fucking Harry commies fucking women on our doorstep. Well, he gets told about this just before his inauguration. Okay, so like this is one of the best things about being president because you get in a room and they say, this is, by the way, this is what's happening. Yeah, yeah. So he doesn't really have much choice in this, but he has to do it. Where's the wig? Where? Hey, Cuba. Yeah. He's trying to fuck the person to tell you about the plan. No, no, no, no. Listen to me. John, please stop. Stop coming from my leg. Someone get a one in the air. Is that Marilyn Monroe? Get in here now. Okay, just put Marilyn in front of him, and when he's, when he's not in, I'll tell them about the plan. Yeah, he's got like ADHD, right? He has to have like, he has to be if I could someone to focus. Attention, high-break to dick disorders. Yeah, he's got like a sub. Is the subway server video underneath? His porn is him. What's your problem? He can only focus on something important if his porn-happing beneath it. Yeah. And that's why we all of his famous speeches, like we must not go, don't ask what you should do with your country, as... What's your country country? Who? No, the other round. But during that speech, he was actually getting hit underneath the podium. Do you know that? I can believe that. So the only reason that he wasn't like constantly humping is because he was getting attacked. Does it always today? Yeah, exactly. Ask not what you're country... Can you be... Ask you what you're... That's a weird amount. It's only time he can focus. That's why he said, he could be an iron balliner. Yeah. He said, I'm a doughnut. Because that's what he says when he comes. I'm a doughnut! Ah, fuck me. Yeah, he came so hard, he turned German for a second. Yeah. We've all been there. We're not cross-eyed. We're my wife. He ended up going... My wife goes, I'm fucking fat. It's like the end of downfall, my wife goes, my god, quite a sight. In blood! Is that bit in the bunker? The bunker. Well, the main thing is my girlfriend coming. Just slow-fury. Yeah, it is the leap god... Click. Himmels. I love that bit because I love the bit where he's like, if you can just do this, right? Yeah. And they're like, no, they... The passions are outside. So that's when I get to third base. She asks, she asks everyone else to leave the room. Which is fair enough. No, they're not everyone. They're still trying to... I'll still see you guys left, yeah. Just leave the guys watching. Just leave the three guys in the portrait. Yeah, it's like, can they really leave? Not you? No, you just... You just watch this. Kaka-kaka-kaka! Come around! I think to be honest, I'm glad... I think we've been too long without a hitter impression. Yeah, even though it's... We should have a clock on the wall when we...

This is the first time they've had a hot guy in power. He's 43, which is went at the time of the Q and Missile Crimes. He's also like fucked. He's got his back is knackered. Yeah, which is probably no one really knows about him. And he's got like jaundice or something. And he's got a disease called Adesons, which my wife actually had for a bit and then... Is that the first internet joke? No, no, that's a generally true. My real life wife. Have you seen the film, the new film, The Demi Moore about... The substance I've actually seen it. But I know it's the premise. And at the end... What's the premise? The premise is that there's this new... It's kind of an oz-em-pick parable, I guess. Is that the premise is that there's a substance you can parable. You can... There's a substance you can... I don't remember that. Parable. So that's an off to the good smaritan, isn't it? Yeah, yeah, yeah. The parable of oz-em-pick. Take this and you'll be thin. Yeah. But I guess it's L.A. people, they want to be thick. They want to be young. And there's this thing you can take where it basically clones you to a better, a younger version of yourself. And then you can only live as them for seven days and then you have to swap back to your old self rather than the old one like the new one recharges. So is it seven days on seven days off? Yeah, but the young one basically starts to take time from the old one, which makes the old one age faster. Right. And she takes more and more and more and then she gets so far... So the picture of Dorian Grace, the other thing? Kind of. And then she gets so far that she injects the new one with the substance, which then multiplies you. Basically it's... It's not typing Google into Google. Yeah, exactly. And the monster at the end is so... Like there's a tip here with some teeth and her face on the back of her head. And she's like, ah! It's like, that's the thing that's the internet wife. What is you in a... If your wife did a crime and you had to explain her to someone like a police drawing? Yeah, it's that. It did not draw in that. I was like a teacher in the teacher. There it got like a mouth on the ass. And she's like, ah! That's the closest representation you've seen to the... The fiction world. But obviously she can't be depicted like the prophet. But I'm not going to make you call it the picture because it'll make you think people angry. Yeah. If they see what she actually looks like. Anyway, my real life wife had a thing called Addison's, which is basically your end-of-crime system doesn't work. So if you fight or fly, nothing, you don't get any adrenaline. Really? So if you basically get hit, if you, if you like, broke a leg, she'd have to go straight, I mean she'd have to go. She's been cured out of Giza. Yeah, she'd be like, she can't walk, basically. So like, what's all the fuss about your legs? What do you mean? You're loosing your... Yeah, she's been hacky-slipped with her broken leg. She's actually why... When you were JFK was shot, he was fine for the first 20 minutes. What did you mean? What's going on? Well, well, he was quite a grown-up. No, but he was on some kind of... He's also just a 60, so he shouldn't have adrenaline. Well, I don't really know, Charlie, can you Google Addison's disease? Because that could be a superpower as well. Well, yeah, I guess... Maybe that's why he was so cool. When you think about it, they think of the factors. His balls are completely empty. Yep. All the time. Yeah. They fill up for a second and then... Ah! And then he comes. Yeah. He's got Addison's, which means that he can't really... Ego. It's a rare disorder that occurs when the adrenal glands are damaged and can't produce the hormone's cortisol, which is the stress hormone. So you can't get stressed? You can't get stressed. All right, so does he...? He's also something that stimulates the immune response. So when you're ill, if you have this disease, you don't... Your immune system doesn't like stars. I don't like... Anyway, I don't care. Why not get stressed because of it? She doesn't have any more. Right. Does she wish she had it again? I wish she had it again. My life would be considerably easier if she could not get stressed. Do you want to just take the kids again for two? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm going to go away for a while. Yeah, fine, yeah, fine. Absolutely fine. My point is, Kennedy is completely fucked. Yeah. And he was in World War II in the Pacific, in a little boat, and he got blown up, and he's got all come back. And that's all come back, yeah. And that's kind of... You don't see that because... With all the pressure. Because he's young, and he's coming in everyone. Yeah, but if you look closer, he's like... The women from the substance, yeah. Yeah, exactly. So... How was he actually that hot, or was he's outlying hot? Like, I think... He probably was, yeah. I just think for the time, when you look at his cabinet... Yeah. Like... God. There's Robert McNamara in him. Yeah, this sounds like a matchmaker day presenter. McBundy. Yeah. McBundy George Bundy. Yeah, he's a fit guy. Look at that. Yeah. Yeah. He's got a charm to him. Teeth. Um, anyway, so he's, so he's pretty fucked, basically. But comes into office, and Eisenhower has, has laid plans for invading Cuba, because the comic, the commies are there. And it's right on America's doorstep, obviously. Yes, it's like... The closest communist country to America. And they're obsessed with making sure the Latin America doesn't go in South America, they're stopping all these plots in Guatemala. Every time they hear about a communist dictate to they are funding counter revolutionaries. And they did that when they communism turned... When Cuba turned to communism, they started funding all the anti-castro. Yeah, yeah. All these Cuban guys that were like, they'd left with the commies right. They're working in garages in Miami, whatever. Hey man, I'm not gonna throw a bus on wheels. I don't want some wheels. He's getting, he's getting slightly more Chinese. Yeah. But, um, that is my, that is my detractive. Cuba was getting slightly more Chinese. It's influenced by Mao and China, wasn't it? Not in the policy, just how they sound. Yeah, is that clear? Hey man, what going on over there? Yeah. So these guys that are basically working in garages put in shiny rims on wheels. Right. Just like bouncing on the ground. That's the low riders. Hey, it's there. Gabron, those guys. Suddenly, Eisenhower's got a plan with a CIA. They're going to send those guys to back to Cuba. Yep. To start a war and overthrow. Yeah, and you sent like 15 of them, right? Or like, they're like, they're basically sent 15. They go, eh, 15 mechanics with a few rifles. Yeah. And then they sent, um, they basically started. They sent a couple of planes over the bomb, and they just, they're copped planes, which they painted badly. That was it. It was all world war two. Yeah, they went, they went, they painted badly so that people wouldn't know as Americans. They went Cuba Airlines, yeah. Like, in like pencil on the side. Not American. Not American, back in the US. But then everyone's just read American. Yeah, yeah. Because they'd written the not small on American big. The record was massive. Yeah, so it was a lot. It was bad, bad planning from them. Promise not the CIA. And so then everyone looked up and said, that's the fucking Americans. And then they got some barris. Right. They didn't do any more bombing. They didn't do any more bombing, even though they promised to the ex, the anti-casher forces in Cuba. Yes, they are. They're not going to help these guys out. And they left them bouncing in their cars with no support. On the bench. Yeah, and they had had the bouncing cars. Yeah, I'm got my big boys again. I'm going to suck me out. And then they just left them there. And now it's really awkward and embarrassing. Yeah, because Castro captured them all. It probably wasn't the nicest to them when he got them. No, that's the Bay of Pigs. Well, the Bay of Pigs, or the Bay of Pigs comes after that ride, which is after that, they're embarrassed, they were drawn, and then they send an invasion. Yeah. And the hope is that it will get all the guys and low riders to bounce Castro out of the car. And then I think Castro sends 20,000 guys to the beach. But the guys and actual cars. I'm just bouncing. Hey, hey, hey. And it's an absolute disaster. Big humiliation for JFK out the gate. And it just sort of feels like it feels like the emphasis is shifting to the Soviets now. Comment, this has been a big win for communism. Because also in the meantime, the Soviets have exploded the biggest fucking ever bomb. Yeah. And so I think with the build up to this, people need to remember, when you think of nuclear war, you're always thinking of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Yeah. But the bombs that they've made now are like, 50 times more than Hiroshima. Yeah. But what's funny about this is that they're basically both these countries, they're exploding these bombs in like remote parts of them. And they're basically going, look at that. Yeah. Don't fucking start on anything. Look at this. I like two neighbors working out and trying to get bigger than each other. Like, what is it? What's the other? I just want to do a Britain doing that in the fucking, in the Pete District. Look at that. Did you see that? Don't come over here. And then there's loads of villages that I will fuck you down. Milton Keynes. Yeah. Oh, you could, yeah, I reckon you could level Milton Keynes. I think the British nuclear test, actually, they had to use Australia, obviously. Do they? That's what Australia's for. It's one of the great barrier reefs, fuck, just. Yeah. But I don't know what we're just doing that. We still want to be involved, I guess. Oh, we've got bombs too. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's what it's like. No, we've got bombs. But so I, I was just to podcast and it said that it would take nine of these hydrogen bombs to entirely flatten America. Right? No, the big, the big, the big, the big bomb starts all of America gone. Yeah. But then Russia, they just got crazy with it. And they, I think they were trying to look for victories over America wherever they could. They was just building more and more. But so Russia made 10,000 of these bombs. Yeah. Which I, is that just because they can? Because you can. Is it because it's scary to have more? Because you actually don't need that many new bombs. No, you need nine. Yeah. Or maybe you need 18. Yeah, because if you want to do the rest of the world, well, you usually need a backup for. Yeah, spares. You need a hard drive and then you need like a backup hard drive. Well, when you're getting like Ikea furniture, this one has to give you spare screws. Yeah, you need a couple of those. You need to. Yeah. But 10,000 teams over the times. It's aggressive. But anyway, the so they basically fuck it a few times. And then then they start thinking we won't invade, but we'll kill Castro. Yeah. And this is probably, this is why this era is maybe my favorite in history is because the early 60s are when bass foreign policy is in real life. Is as close to James Bond as it ever is. It's it's almost like it's Roger Moore James Bond. Oh, yes, fast call. Like, can you get the list of assassination attempts? Yeah, Charlie. It's yeah, it's this clown music playing. It's umbrella hats. Yeah, it's like that fit woman. And give it this like they hide dynamite in pretty looking conch shells. So then when he dives, he's like, oh, then you'll blow up. I mean, sort of this period, it's like now, it feels like everything's going to come out. And they didn't really think like that. So all these meetings, everyone's thinking, how's history going to remember this. But this is still a period where you could do stuff covertly. Well, so the plot then becomes, we're just going to we're going to fuck Cuba. We're going to try and kill Castro. Yeah. Or just trying to fuck, but they call it fuck Cuba generally. They call this Operation Mongoose. Yeah. Operation Mongoose for sure. Yeah. And Operation Mongoose, well, so there's the Poison Cigars method. Where they they laces the guards with poison. And then I don't know how did it fail because he didn't smoke the guitar and cigars or the poison didn't work. So they tried 683 times and this is we're just going to go through 14 of them. Yeah. So Poison Cigars exploding cigar. Yeah. Where it basically just they just replaced the guy with a stick of dynamite. Yeah. And I hope you wouldn't notice. But yeah, I think sadly they should have painted it brown at least. Yes, they did. They laid it in the tray and they left them in. Oh, fuck. It's red. Yeah. The Poison Diving Suit, that's a good one. In 1961, the CIA devised a plan to poison Castro by lacing his diving suit with a toxic substance, like a fungus. Yeah. Right. Yeah. The idea was Castro had wear the suit while swimming in the ocean and the poison would be absorbed through his skin. The plan was abandoned as Castro never wore the suit. Either due to the timing of his dives or other just issues, he doesn't go diving. Yeah. So then, anyway, he'd like a poison cycling like crew, you know, they'd also be like, maybe he'll get into cycling. He's a 40 year old guy. Maybe he'll get into the tools that he used when you're hot climbing. They had like, they had like that, but asbestos. We're running out of hobbies here. Maybe he's going to get into chess. Let's put making exploding queen. He fucks women. He fucks women. His only hobby. Right. It's the 60s. You don't have hobbies. You cheat on your wife. That's all you do. They weren't poisoned milkshake. Sky drink milk. That looks like some expensive. No, it looks like some dollar. Yeah. We can read through it. So go on to some. It's funny how every outcome is the plan was never carried out successively as Castro apparently never consumed a milkshake. But this is like, yeah, this is back in the, this is back in the time where politics would be a group of white guys who all went to similar schools. Yes. So they all are all thinking the same way. Yes, today. So everyone has just got like the same way. No one's bringing news. Also everyone is, everyone's on speed. And they're calling it vitamins. That's the other thing to mention is that at this time, the fashionable thing to do was get injected with speed if you had a cold. Yeah. So I'm feeling about another weather. Yeah, I know what's all you out. It's like Joe Rogan or Chris Williamson on their podcast. They would be advertising. Yeah, the supplements. Medicine vitamins. Yeah, yeah. Make it stronger. Yeah. Right. Make your brain work. Yeah. They also then start. They also were like, let's poison him slowly. So he's, he slows his words and is less impressive. And there's some point that he went, well, let's just try and make him a bit shit. Rather than killing him. Let's just make him more. Yeah, there's just kind of like little shitty passive aggressive. It was passive aggressive foreign policy at this stage. But it also seems like the guys in the CIA were like, they're like in a writer's room just banging coke. Like, okay, right. No, that's not worked. Right. Right. Let's go back to the guards. Yeah, this is the guards. Yeah, this is TV execs in the 90s, you know. Poisoned toothpaste. Let's poison his toothpaste. Does he own a developer plan to use poison? Do it a method of assassination. Sadly, Cassidy doesn't brush his teeth. Does he have a man do anything? But fuck. I love this one. So they've done, they've had 10 ones are going to go poison toothpaste, bad luck hat. Number 12, bomb in the head. Cautious. Fuck it. Bomb him. Just bomb him. Again, never have the wrecked pot. Yeah, I think more direct. Involving part of the bomb in Cassidy's in quarters where he regularly helped meetings. The bomb was supposed to explode, but it didn't. Anyway, so they're constantly trying to kill Cassidy. They can't. He's like a cockroach. Cock a roach. And so, but tried the smartest one they did, which is not here, is they try to go through one of his ex-girlfriends, which I feel is the way to get Castro, where she was going to give him like an ointment that was actually poisoned, obviously. Yeah, yeah. But then he was like, ointment, I don't know, I put a put it in there. Yeah, but it was like, I'm, I'm, you're my ex. I'm, hey, Capron, I know. He's his current ones, you know. At one point that we're going to make his car so bouncy that he just flew off from. He just flew into the sea. Um, anyway, so we haven't talked about the Russians yet, though, should we? No, we've got to talk about Cruchev, who is my favorite in the story in my work. Cruchev, little one is bio, please. The little squat man, he looks like the ghost of a hemorrhoid. Big, and I was speaking at the UN, he's like, oh, is he? Yeah, yeah, he's really, he's all, he's all punches. I have a saucepot for Cruchev as far as Soviet premiers go. I don't know what it is. If you found a Cruchev on your low back, you'd have to go to a doctor, wouldn't you? Yes, yes, yes. Like, yeah, yeah. That's not what you want to see as a man when you're heading into your thirties. If you find Cruchev down there. You're a little down to see that. LAUGHTER So if you find a Gorbachev down there, then you're, then you're, it's probably too late. You're, do your turn, terminal. terminal. You look down, you see Gorbachev's head. Too fair. You probably could go through all the Soviet premiers post-Styling. Yeah. And all of them are. As different stages of, of testicular cancer. That's sick. You know, Cruchev, this round hairy ball, but then you get in Brezhnev, there's like, weird hair on it. Yeah. You get to Gorbachev with this clear growth on it. Any of Boris Yeltsin, that was just so puffed up. So Cruchev's kind of the opposite of Kennedy in many ways. Right, can we go on Cruchev's bio, right? So he was raising a poor peasant family, worked in factories and coal man's as a young man, joined the Communist Party 19th-East after the Russian Revolution. He was basically like the ultimate politician. Yeah. Like, if you've seen Death of Stalin, he was played by Steve Bouchemme and everyone's got their special thing, but his was just like, he was just like, good at talking to people and making friends and telling jokes. So Stalin kept him around because he was the funniest. I reckon he's slapping people a lot. Yeah, exactly. He's just like, he knew exactly how to play it. And of what, every, he's survived so much because for like 20 years, all of his colleagues are constantly getting executed. Right, yeah. Like, this is Stalin, he survived all the curses. And when someone kills somebody, he's like, yeah, that was funny. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So it's, yeah. Amazing lead tense time to what be at the high command of Stalin because every other week, one of your colleagues is getting killed. Yeah. It's sort of like, yeah, it's kind of like a squid game type thing. It's kind of like squid game where you get a bit being Stalin's to the high command. Dada, da, da, da, da. Oh my god, actually, do you know why? It was more. In many ways, because what I like, Cruychev is to replace Stalin or even survive Stalin. It is sort of like Takeshi's castle. Yeah. That's how they did Russian politics back then, where you go into it and 90% of you are going to be killed. Yeah. Or, you know, it's very unlikely you'll survive. Yes. But if you win big bribes, right? Yeah. You get a castle. Yeah. And then Cruychev as well, when he became, brought me, he just did a massive speech saying, you know, like Stalin, fuck Stalin, because he's dead. Yeah, yeah, he's dead. Apparently, which they had in the death of Stalin, Cruychev's wife, who I can't remember the name of, but it was quite a big part of his life. Google is hopeful. It's quite a big one. What does she look like? But he treated the people in the way. I'm going to guess bad. Let's have a look. Yeah. Oh, she looks very sweet. Yeah, she's sweet. Sort of, sort of, homely woman. Yeah. But she, they would make note to the jokes that had landed and didn't land with Stalin. Really? So it would be like, we're not talking about, you know, we're not doing that bit. That bit didn't work. That bit didn't work because... He did not like that. Which, you know, it's a community. You know, it's a community you've got to respect. You've got to play with what's in your ass. You've got to respect the craft. And I think there was a lot of humorous guys there and he knew like my, at least I know how to structure a joke, you know? Well, he walked a line. Yeah. Much like many of us do. I think when he pretty did the Chinese accents, Stalin absolutely loved that. He loved that. He hated Mao, Stalin. He fucking hated Mao. So Cruychev was doing the eyes and the teeth and Stalin's like, this guy, I like this guy. Yeah. And then... And then, I'm like, George and Stalin didn't like that at all. That's not funny. That's not funny. So you just don't need to... Yeah. Cabbage water again. But safe. Details in Yamava.com is be 21 to enter. Please gamble responsibly. Bullings and marcas. Reba has wow. You're running, if you're, I don't know, in the Polo Bioros High Command, right? Yeah. You're one of the guys in the ring. You're Stalinist communist Russia. Because you're not, you're not a very communist man, right? Me. But... You're still, you know, you're still an ambitious man. If you were in Soviet Russia, yeah. You would be playing the game a lot, I think. I think it's impossible to live in Soviet Russia and not play the game. Yeah, so you got... So it's interesting with these people, it's not about if they're communist or capitalist. You wake up, you're in Soviet Russia, you wanna end up... I'd like some bread today. What do I have to do? I'd like some bread and to not be shot. Yeah, so whatever you think of communism, if you set up there, you're still gonna try and thrive. How are you, you're in the Polo Bioros, what is gonna be your tactic with Stalin? Are you gonna be the JAPESTA? I am gonna cross my fingers behind my back. But yeah, I'll do that. And then I'll wink at everyone. You'll do what? I'll do whatever he says. Okay, right. And then I'll wait to walk. If you step away then I go, NADD! NADD! Because you got to cover your back, right? KC, in case... You got to play both sides. Terrifying. Yeah. So hard. It would be very stressful, I think. So boring as well. Yeah. So boring, just constantly having to think about how you're being perceived like that. Yeah, because it's like... The stakes are really high. Yeah. But it's still working in an office. And wearing shit suits. So it's kind of like... I don't know, it's just like working in recruitment. Yeah. But if you get it wrong... Yes, sure. Yes, sure. Or though I do think more Foxden's agents should live under the threat of being and summarily executed. Yeah, it would be good to have a Stalinist head of that. Yeah, I think so. Yeah. And a real power show. Well, just saying where they eat themselves... Well, I wouldn't mind having the top Foxden guy, but I want everyone else to die trying to find out who that is. Yeah, right. Okay. So KC's castle... But Foxden. But Foxden. Yeah. Right. So Krishov rose to power. Complete opposite of JFK. What I like about Krishov as well, he's a bit of a fucking... He's a bit of a mad cunt, you know? He's like, he's a big gambler, right? Is he? He likes to... Well, just... He makes big gambles with foreign policy. He's like... He's really like, let's just fucking... Let's see what happens. No, I mean, no, he is. Because it's... It's also... With this whole period, they completely misjudged each other's systems. Where he's... The people around Krishov, obviously, are handpicked. And people who think he's brilliant. Yeah. And agree with him. Or at least pretend to. Yeah. And he has complete control over all decisions. JFK has just come in. There's press saying that he's a fucking little bitch. Yeah. There's a press that he's too young to do it. He's trying to balance political opinion. Everything he does, yes, to think. Well, he's just around my people who are fucking him. Yeah, he's all the time. That's why he's doing it. Eh, why? But every decision he has to make, he has to also think, I need to... I need to say the world, but also I just want to get elected next term. Yeah. But Krishov... Krishov... I've got the stroke for life. But also, if you slag me off of the press, you are going to get shot. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I see what you mean. Right, yeah. So it gives them both very different negotiating powers. And I think that's what Krishov misunderstood about JFK was he was like, it's just two men playing a game of poker, right? Yeah. So we do a little bit here, a little bit there. But for JFK, he had to think about so much more. He has to go through so many more hoops. Because he's a fucking weak, damn right. He's a fucking weak, he's a guy with a bad back from fucking too much, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Rob was too Pacific, but I don't believe it for a second. So anyway, back to the story, right? So anyway, Krishov starts, or I don't know, somehow they put missiles in Cuba. After the Bay of Pigs, because of the embarrassment, America stops surveilling Cuba, right? Right. After they've done that badly painted plane, the PR is too bad for them to send anymore. Yeah. This is clearly a brief window opportunity. JFK or Eisenhower have also put missiles in Turkey. That's a big thing. Yeah, they put them in Turkey. And then Turkey was like, yes, please, my friends, yes. You want missiles? Please, please, come in, please. My cousin also sells a rug. Yeah. How many you want, my friends? Good price, good price, please. Missiles, fine, I take missiles. So they brought you on salad, do you want sauce? Yeah. They haggled a great deal in Turkey. They thought it was a great deal. Yeah, it was, they lost lots of money. The rugs weren't real. They also put missiles in Italy. I think if you're going to put missiles in Italy and Turkey, you've immediately got a weak hand. So I tell you something, you want those missiles fired? They're not being fired. You go, fire, they go, yeah, you don't mean it. You don't mean it, please. You won't wait my friends, sit down. It's fine. That's what happens in both those countries. Yeah. Both those countries have lag. They have Mediterranean. Mediterranean lag. Mediterranean lag. Is that a term you're going to coin potentially? That's, I've just coined that now. Mediterranean lag. Mediterranean lag. You ask the Mediterranean person to do something. And there'll be a lag of an hour to half a day before it gets done. Is there a point? Is there an epicenter where the lag increases? What is the epicenter? Where nothing happens at all. Right. Greece is just... So like, you push, you push to Spain. There is lag. But it's not as much as Italy. Not as much as Greece. Yeah, Mediterranean lag starts in Spain. Portugal doesn't have it, because it's windy. Right. Then it gets Spain and it starts to move. They have a NASA day or a bit tired. Because it's not Mediterranean. Portugal. Please, no, no, it's fine. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Portugal's Atlantic country. Yeah. So they lose the lag? They don't have no lag. Yeah. Mediterranean, Spain, sleepy. Italy, oh, it's not today. It's too far away. They're just fucking boring. They're just sort of sat, the fucking, getting, you know, in Sicily, you know, they can eat grita in the morning. Ice cream. How you start your day and you wake up, I have ice cream. I feel a bit, I go back to work. In Scotland, you have ice cream on wedding days and never again. You have, yeah, yeah. On your one scoop of ice cream on your wedding day and then you throw up immediately and you repent for the rest of your life. Yeah, this is far away from Mediterranean lag. So then you get to like, sort of cypress grita and then Greece just, it's literally fat man's out in a chair not doing it. Now, something that's close to the epicenter Mediterranean lag but doesn't have Mediterranean lag and that's why there's so many problems is Israel. Yes. You can see that Israel maybe are not meant to be there. By the way, they act. It's clearly, they're in the wrong times. You're clearly in the wrong place. Yeah, and that's why there's something fights going on. It's asymmetric warfare because Israel is doing things on time. Yeah. And everyone else is like, Hey, police, wait, wait a minute. I'm just going to Albert. But there's a natural order to things in Israel by going against the Mediterranean lag and fucked everything up. That's why that region is such a mess. Yes, no, I agree. It's all works on their own schedule and Israel have come in and come in with Scottish energy. Yeah. Yeah. So anyway, so, yeah, so the, so America has quite defunct Turkish missiles but they're shit missiles, right? Okay. They got, they are shit missiles, I think. I think they're old. Sure. Please, not good missiles. Yeah, no, very good. Very good price. Please, please, please. That's a rolled up rug. No, no, no. No, no, no, no, please. My friend is fine. He's fine. He works just like in all of this. Just let him go. He's setting fights with real leather. He's a real leather. Please, please. My friends, did that. Watch, watch, watch, watch. To the fight to the bottom of the rug. And they're like, where is the dip vats we sent out there? Well, sadly, the folks guys have got them to speak to their cousins and then they've got them to speak to their other cousins. They're lost in like a web of market stores in a bizarre. They're in a suit somewhere. They sold incense. Yeah. So, um, cruise ship thinks, well, they've got missiles pointed at us right on our border. It's, we need to get them back. In this tiny little window, cruise ships like, let's roll the dice. Snake eyes. He's just like, damn it. He's like, yeah, he just starts jacking it. Yeah. Well, he's not getting sex from his wife. No. But he just goes, hoping for snake eyes. You know, he's just a real like, he's a man. He's pushing the foot. But also, there's no one's going to tell him any different, is it? Yeah, right. He's just here. Yeah, he just goes for it. He's playing risk. Fuck it. He's not balancing other things. He's just like, let's put it in there. And masterfully, they do get missiles into Cuba. Yeah. And then when events start happening again, they just see photos of clearly missiles. Which is, you know why? It's because cruise ships on in Cuba, they were like, oh yeah, it's fine that you can, there's trees. Yeah. But cruise ships never seen a palm tree before. Of course not. So it doesn't realize. He's a Russian person. Yes, he doesn't realize there's no foliage at all in the palm tree. So from the air, it's just like, well, that's just a missile over there. He said the dense palm tree forest, which don't exist. Also, as you know that they got all the Russians who put missiles in Cuba were all wearing Hawaiian shirts. She knows that. What was it? What was it? The first time they've seen the sun? No, it was a disguise. They were like, right, don't wear your Russian uniforms, obviously. But just put on Hawaiian shirts. So it's basically a bunch of like 50 year old autistic men who go on game shows in this country. I like pointless. I was at Pointless contestants moving missiles onto Cuba. I watched Pointless recently. The prize pot. Yeah. I wasn't ready for how low it was. It was so low. So funny. Yeah. Because I guess because watching American games, I've seen Mr. Beast games, the Squid games were. Mr. Beast games, the prize pot is 5 million. Yeah. And they're giving loads of different prizes in 100,000 pounds. Pointless, the starting prize pot is 800 pounds. And then if you like pass with flying colours, you get pointless. Three pointless answers at the end. It goes up to 1,250 pounds. Yeah. And it's always like, so what are you going to do with that? I'm probably getting my two months rent, maybe. No, it's funny because it's basically their return fair home. If they come for like leaves, I guess it's peak time now. I'll leave it for five. Someone said he's going to, let shows what's your pointless. The guy won it, so he's going to put new shelves up. Brilliant. Right. Because of that yourself. So anyway, so to recap, Kennedy is absolutely ankle deep in clunge. Yeah. He's kind of, he doesn't know what's going on. Castro is bouncing his ankle deep in clunge, breathing a bouncy car. Khrushchev's the only guy who doesn't have a face full of moth. Yeah. And because of that, he's taking this opportunity. He's saying all of the other players in this really tense, geopolitical situation literally have not come up for air. Me in my sexist marriage, I've got a small window here in which to put nuclear missiles, about 100 miles away from the American border. Yeah. So he puts them there and he uses a bunch of pointless contestants. Just smuggle missiles, answers the Cuban mainland. Yeah. And then the pictures are because it's, they're on like the beach. Yeah. They're seeing all of these Cuban guys, these hot sexy Cuban guys who are playing like volleyball. Yeah. You know, it's just like, they're having the best time ever. And it's like, they're fucking... There's some pale men in Hawaiian shirts. What are they carrying? Is that a massive rolled up rug? What's going on there? Why did there's ones not like rolled up rug? That's like an actual missile. Not my friend, they're pleased. It's the same. It's the same model. Promise. So it's then that it starts... What happens? They take a photo. The U2, U2 surveillance plane, which is bono, the edge, and the other guy. Yeah. They're flying over Cuba. Before they decided to pivot into music, they did fly... We were in Colossians flights. But after this whole crisis, they decided that it was too much than they said we're going to make... You know, it's fucking tiring, lad. It's fucking tiring. The flights... The flights are all Cuba. Joe fucking far away, Cuba's. Who's flying the plane? Under fucking poverty. Because bono's not flying it, I reckon. He's just... Bono's flying it. Do you reckon? Yeah. That's why he's got those glasses. Yeah. Yeah. So the... So Operation Manga's still happening. Yeah. They're still trying to kill Castro. Right. We're getting into what? 62... Is that's what... Yeah, here we go. But there's a meeting, right? And this is the only time... Oh, he's coming. Sorry. The JFK meets... Chris Krelth. And this is before any of this happened. And it's also... There's a lot of tension going on in the Berlin Wall, right? So that's where the wall is just about to come up, right? Yeah. Because it's... Everyone's leaving East Germany to go to West Germany because they've got no bread, right? And so the East Germany... Well, everyone in East Germany is going like, is that... Is that a nightclub where people are just getting fished? I quite like that. Is that a nightclub where you can just go in and you just get fished in? And then you can leave. Right. Everyone's just kind of like... Yeah, I guess it's... Nice to listen to the three songs on repeat. Yeah. In a village hall. Those guys seem to be listening to like... techno. And they're having like sex parties and it's fine. And quickly the communists in East Germany realise this is unsustainable if we lose all of our guys... If they all get a burqaim, then we're going to lose everyone. So they're starting to build a wall and it's like, this is a real... They meet. There's a big meeting, right? I don't know where it is. I think it's in the end, I don't know. With the ender, yeah. And Kennedy's for E3. Smart guy obviously, but Cruchev's been around the block, right? Cruchev has won Takeshi's castle to be... Yeah. So he is like a real political navigator. And Cruchev just completely... He's also physically literally a bowling ball. So he's quite intimidated. Yeah. Cruchev balls full of cum. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely jacked the lines on cum. Yeah. Can a... Can a... Kennedy's woozy because he's got no cum in his ball. There's no like drive to him. Cruchev, it's about to blast out his head. There's no adrenaline, there's no cum. It's just... It's just empty. But by all accounts, Cruchev just completely bodies him. Right. He's the fluid. Yeah. He just completely like big time to him. Yeah. You know, and Kennedy just leaves complete. Like they even have like an ideological argument about capitalism versus communism, right? And yeah, and Cruchev completely bodies him. But then Cruchev's like, I'm going to put the wall up because everyone's going to burqine. Yeah. So he puts the wall up. Just stop people going to burqine. Yeah. And then Kennedy comes back and he's like, right, I'm, I've been out on week. Yeah. Right. So then does he start flying over Cuba again or... I don't actually know the time line. It doesn't matter. This is a podcast is not about what actually, who knows? At some point, you two are flying over Cuba. Yeah. Right. And Bono looks down and he sees the pointless celebrities holding missiles that are actually missiles. Yeah. Rather than some magic carpets, some boffemen sold the Americans in Turkey. Yeah. And maybe we'll leave this there and continue to party. So that's all the context you should need for the Cuban Missile Crisis. Yes, that's all you need. In part two, we will get on to the actual crisis itself. And if you can't wait to see what happens, that episode is already on our Patreon for \u00a33 a month, you can become a truther. The next episode is already there. But otherwise, thank you for listening. Either way, we'll see you next time. See you next time. For the limited time only, prices and participation may vary.

      "text": "Human history, like a river, will keep moving forward with moments of both calm waters and huge waves. We have before us the opportunity to forge a new world order. The problem with modern base unit power is precisely what we expect. The West is leading Ukraine down the Primrose path. We don't have enough tanks, we don't have enough vessels, we don't have enough planes. To bring chip productions here to the US. I'm Andrew Collingwood. I write for Bornbrook magazine and other online outlets on GeoStrategy, Economics and British Politics. My name is Philip Pilkington. I'm a macro-convictist who spent nearly a decade working in investment management. Both of us believe that the world is undergoing a once-a-century geopolitical and macroeconomic shift. After decades of American leadership, the unipolar world is finally ending. We'll be talking about economics and geopolitics, but most importantly we'll be talking about how they influence each other, how resource competition drives the great game of empires and alliances, and how that story is the great emerging tale of the 21st century. This is multi-polarity, charting the rise of the new multi-polar world order. Coming up this week. The post SVB banquron continues. It's been a week of the biggest deposit withdrawals since 1980. From Geneva to Wall Street, is there a mattress big enough to put all this money behind? The furniture revolting, but is Macron's recent trial by fire really a bay pension reforms, or is this just a spark to the cost of living tender now laid out all across Europe? Benjamin Netanyahu faces mass protest as he tries to overrule Israel's judges. As America's pool of Middle East and allies seems to be diminishing by the week, how will the State Department play this one? Back BB or bin BB? But first, tanking banking. Last week we were talking about Silicon Valley buying, which obviously collapsed due to the fact it had a very large number of idiosyncratic depositors who had very large deposit holdings that were over the federally guaranteed limit, the FDI at sea limit of $250,000. Over the course of this week, and probably the biggest story is the Credit Suisse also went down. That's a notable story for a number of reasons. First of all, because Credit Suisse is a very large well-known bank, not in America, so it's obviously not directly tied into the same ecosystem that Silicon Valley bank went down in. The other interesting thing about Credit Suisse is that it is one of the two large banks in Switzerland, the other one being UBS, and Credit Suisse was actually then gobbled up by UBS in a sort of a bay laid where the government backed the merger and put some sweeteners and so on in to allow the merger to take place. That's created a banking monopoly in Switzerland, which is an interesting story in and of itself. What I think where the watchers have now started watching is at least in the last few days and probably at the end of last week is whether there's broader movements in deposits. As we said last week, what respect to Silicon Valley bank, what happened was quite like a classic bank run. The buzz that's been going around, especially online on Twitter and so on, is are there broader movements of deposits now out of the banking sector in general? Are we about to see the first kind of post-virtual world mass bank run in human history? The technology certainly makes it a lot easier to do and we can go into that more later because you can move this money very easily from your bank account into, for example, a money market fund. But there's been a lot of watching that. I actually put out a few tweets over the past two days trying to get some good metrics on it. There have been metrics shared online, which show it to be the worst bank run in history. Since the data started and there were other metrics going around that said it was business as usual, what I found when I dug into it is there's a lot of bad metrics going around and a lot of people trying to sell a certain narrative. But ultimately, I think I put some pretty reasonable numbers together and I did the analysis properly and I found that yes, we are experiencing a major event. In fact, over the course of the week of the 15th, it's been the largest event since the data starts. In a nutshell, we had Silicon Valley Bank, which was a unique bank, it serviced one particular part of the American economy, the tech startup out of that economy predominantly because of the nature of that business, though that industry. Silicon Valley Bank had a large number of big deposits way over the $250,000 limit from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Now that would have been fine in itself because Silicon Valley Bank had dumped a large number of those deposits in very safe investments like mortgage securities and US treasuries, the US sovereign bonds. The problem came when the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, started raising interest rates. There's also increasingly interest rates on treasuries and mortgage backed securities. It's essentially pushed the value of those mortgage backed securities and treasuries that Silicon Valley Bank had on it, books down. Again that would have been absolutely okay because the bank regulation, the US allows banks not to realize those losses every quarter. They don't have to market to market. They don't have to market price those things when they're putting in their accounts. They can actually just price them as at par as the price they would get if they were held to maturity. However, when people started withdrawing their money out of Silicon Valley Bank, Silicon Valley Bank then had to sell some of these securities and then the losses were crystallized, and everybody realized there was big losses and Silicon Valley Bank went into a very fast doom loop and eventually went burst and the depositors had to be bailed out. This also happened in a number of other sectors but you're suggesting Philip as far as I understand that we're seeing it across the banking sector. Perhaps because the banking sector is offering what like one and a half maximum percent interest on deposits, whereas you can just dump that into a US treasury fund and get four and a half percent and US treasuries are every bit as safe as banks if you can hold them to maturity. I'm not sure if that's the reason but you're very certain that what we're seeing is a steady or maybe like a slow motion bankrum in effect across the whole banking sector. I know that credit Swiss was again a fairly specific bank because it'd been a lot of trouble even before it's denouement last week. It lost 70% of its share price from a few years ago as far as I remember. You're fairly certain that what we're seeing is a sector wide issue with deposits being withdrawn from the system. Yeah, I wouldn't say I'm certain we're seeing a broad bankrum. What we can say from the data is the data of the week of the 15th. We saw the biggest deposit withdrawal relative to assets. You have to measure the two relative to one another. We saw the biggest one on record since 1980. The other big ones were basically in 2008. There was another big deposit withdrawal week during the dot com bubble. At the very least, this is a pretty good financial crisis indicator I would read it as in retrospect. But if this continues, we could have some serious problems. Just to give some sense, in that week of the 15th, it was about $600 billion of deposits were withdrawn from the banking system. The banking system is absolutely enormous. I think the overall at the moment in deposits is close to over $18 trillion at its peak. $600 billion relative to $18 trillion isn't very large. That's for a lot of bullish internet commentators were saying, but you can't measure that way. You have to measure it relative to the asset base of the bank. How quickly that $600 billion is withdrawal? That's how you get the shock impact that can really mess with the bank's balance sheet like we saw on Silicon Valley bank. We have the biggest one on record since 1980 unless the data from the Federal Reserve is lying. We can say that with certainty. What we cannot say with certainty is if it continues. Another component of this that's been highlighted now is this interest rate issue. Obviously, interest rates have shot up because the Federal Reserve is raising rates, but the banks for whatever reason aren't paying these reasonable rates of interest on savings. Why that is, I don't fully understand, but I think the best gas is that these banks have had their business models seriously messed with during the zero interest rate policy era. They've got used to for whatever reason, paying these low rates on savings. Their entire business model is built around this. If they raise the interest rates that they're paying on savings and deposits, it will massively interfere with their business model. That would be my guess. What that means is, as you say, all the saver has to do, even if they're not concerned about the viability of the bank is take that money and put it into an instrument that will yield that. Yes, you could buy treasury bonds with that. Even more simply, you can put it in a money market fund, which just invests in very short term like with debt, government debt. You say, well, the government debt is as safe as the banks. The government debt is more safe than the banks because the banks are only backed by the full faith and credit of the US government up to the deposit limit of $250,000. Bonds are protected right up to infinite in a sense. If you're willing to buy a bond and sit on a total maturity, it's 100%. Unless the US government defaults, you're getting that money back. Of course, a bond, a 10-year bond, you won't want to hold to maturity. If you invest in a money market fund, these are usually three-month papers. If you keep your money in that for three months, you'll get your face value back. What you're seeing is two forces at the same time. Putting your money, transferring it from a deposit into a money market account will pay you more interest and it's safer. Why wouldn't you do this? What's happening is basically two things at the same time. You're being offered either a lower interest rate deposit account or a higher interest rate money market fund or something equivalent or something similar. The lower interest deposit account pays you less and it's less secure. Whereas the higher interest yielding money market account pays you more and it's more secure. It's a no-brainer where you should put your money. All of this is undergirded by the fact that because of the new banking apps, an online banking and mass access to financial products that everybody now has, moving your money from the deposit account into the money market account only takes a few clicks of a button. Again, who wouldn't do this? It sounds to me that there's one of two options here. Either this isn't really a big deal because the banks can just pay more interest. They could pay people a reasonable level of interest instead of trying to take like 400 basis points difference between their north point five percent and the four and a half percent of the US Treasury is offering. They can do that or the government can make sure that everybody know that their deposit are cast-iron safe and there's nothing to worry about and they don't have to withdraw their cash. In which case everything ends? It's fine. This seems to me a case of people are just concerned that banks have maybe some unrealized losses and if everybody withdraws their money then that's going to be a problem for those banks and maybe the government can't backstop it. Everybody had every bank which might be quite reasonable but as soon as the government makes a promise that they will then that should be safe or as soon as the banks start offering a slightly bigger rate of interest which this should be able to do. Banks traditionally don't need that bigger spread between the risk free rate and what they're willing to offer to make some kind of profit. It's not really how banks have worked in the past or the other alternatives that you may be suggesting here Philip is that the entire banking model and when I say banking out commercial the likes of you and I depositing our money they're getting our wages paid in there and maybe taking mortgages or loans for cars and the same for businesses then getting their revenues paid in there and maybe getting some loans as well. That kind of side rather than the investment banking side. That's all done for now because they just can't attract or at least it's going to be a lot smaller because like you say I can download any number of apps now for my smartphone and got access to money market funds, brokerage here and go on and invest in almost any security I want to. It makes up shares and traded funds and bonds commercial bonds and sovereign bonds as well and all kinds of things I can get access to now. If I can do that it really gives me as a consumer much bigger option than sticking my money into a bank especially like a term deposited in a bank where they pay a fixed rate of interest over a specific period of time when I can't touch my money. Why would I do that when I can just buy higher yielding instruments over my phone which at least is safe. There's two options here either the ground top of this and offer a bit more interest or the government steps in and say don't worry about it deposits they're all safe in which cases crisis over or the banking model is done for the commercial banking model anywhere it's finished especially at that scale. Am I missing something? Is there something deeper up here maybe have the interest rates increased to a level where banks are starting to realize very serious losses on their investment portfolios on the asset side of their balance sheet? My feeling is something is preventing them from raising those interest rates for depositors. We can go around and we can wave banners and say that it's greedy banks and have a nice occupy and Wall Street sit in but the reality of the situation is the banks are probably terrified and if they thought that they could raise those savings rates on deposits and keep everybody happy I think they probably would. I mean I'm not certain of that maybe the people who say that their greedy or whatever are correct but I just don't really buy it. If you're managing a bank the first thing that you have to do is just keep the doors open you know day to day stability and you'll do pretty much anything to save off instability including raising the rates on deposits. So it does suggest that maybe there is something deeper at work and I think it might be what you alluded to that for some reason there are possibly heavy losses already on the books because of the rising interest rates or the other possibility is that there's just some structural issue that the banks have gotten very used to these low interest rates and they've baked it in as being pretty much permanent and that if they raise the rates that they're paying depositors that they'll fall into net losses. If they won't have any more profits anymore and then they'll be then they'll be vulturized like credit suites. So it feels to me like there probably is some sort of catch 22 playing out in terms of the deposits and the interest rates and so on. The alternative explanation is greedy bankers that don't care about their day-to-day stability other depositors. That seems unlikely to me but we'll know with time in terms of the deposit insurance aspect. Yes the Fed could come in and deposit, blanket deposit, the blanket guarantee, all deposits. Now what that start people leaving for the more profitable vehicles it might not actually. We don't know how much of this is fear and how much of this is greed in a sense. But beyond that stepping in and guaranteeing all deposits, blanket guarantee on deposits is a big deal. I mean obviously Yellen and the rest of the crowd bailed out Silicon Valley bank. We were quite critical that on the podcast. Yellen then came out afterwards and said we are not giving a blanket guarantee to all depositors. Now I said on Twitter and I think he said something similar. Why would you give a guarantee to this group and not to everybody? There was no rationale for it. The claim was that Silicon Valley bank depositors were systemically risky but that doesn't stand up to scrutiny. I don't think that the regulators want to step in and give a blanket guarantee on deposits. In one sense I'm kind of pathetic to that. We spoke about it on the Silicon Valley bank episode. Capital is not something that the government guarantees. The deposit guarantees are there to ensure that there isn't mass bank runs and to ensure that people with their average savings don't get wiped out. But anything above 250 grand and frankly I think 250 grand is a very generous deposit guarantee in the UK. It's only 85,000 pounds which actually seems more reasonable to me. Anything above that is capital and it's capital that you have to manage. If we blanket guarantee depositors that's forever. That's something we can never walk back and that really does change the nature of the game, the capitalist game in a way that we've never seen before. And I can only imagine how many for seen consequences will arrive at a rise out of that. I can imagine many ways in which shrewd and unscrupulous financial players would use that guaranteed deposit system to make money, to make greedy bets, to do all sorts of things. I do have some sympathy with the regulators here that they don't want to step in and do the deposit guarantee. Now they may end up doing it anyway in which case our listeners will know the rules have changed. But we'll see. On the other hand, the same regulators who are refusing to raise the deposit guarantee are the very ones that gave us years of quantitative easing and zero interest rate policy that's leading to the current problems. As struggled to wrap my head around this on several levels, the first thing is that the root cause of this seems to have been that as interest rates shot up and the Federal Reserve really has increased interest rates at a very rapid pace. I think they felt that they were caught well behind the 8 ball. They left it too long to raise interest rates and now they're really trying to catch up so they've shot up at a rare old pace. However, the Federal Reserve also signaled that this is exactly what they wanted to do. The signal that they were itching to do it, the signal that they were going to go very quickly. I don't understand how the banks have been caught off guard by this. I understand that banks are required to hold very safe assets like US Treasuries, like mortgage bank securities. In order to be as safe as they possibly can be. But there's a very tried and trusted methods to get around this, which is to cycle into much shorter term paper when you realize that the Federal Reserve is going to tighten interest rates. Now, if I, Alayman, understand and know this, I'm damn sure that bankers earn literally tens of millions of dollars a year in wages and bonuses, should understand it as well. I can't quite get my head around how or why they've been caught so off guard by this. The second thing I would say is with regard to Silicon Valley Bank and the uniqueness of that, I read Paul Krugman's opinion editorial column in the New York Times. And he basically argued that case for bailing out the Silicon Valley Bank depositors was the same as bailing out Chrysler and Ford during the early days of the financial crisis that basically Chrysler and Ford, that there were a key part of the US economy. They had network effects. And if they fell, it wouldn't just be them falling. It would be like a whole industry and support industries that have built around the mode over the decades and I suppose century these days. I think it was Chrysler in general Motors, not Chrysler and Ford. Excuse me. I think Ford didn't need to bail out, but I might be wrong on that. Anyway, he argued that Silicon Valley was very similar. I think that's a kind of post-res argument, but that's the argument that they're making. And I think you're 100% right. They cannot blanket guarantee all the positives. That would just create so many false incentives. It would essentially be giving bankers free money with which to play because they would be incentivized to offer the highest interest rates possible and take the biggest risks in terms of their investments in order to attract all of this kind of money that would be free essentially because the federal US government would be guaranteeing it. But my final point, and I guess the question is I don't see how, you know, where this is going. It seems to me one of those strange slow motion things with the global financial crisis and subprime loans. You understood where the breaking point was. You understood the point at which, look, if we don't deal with this, you know, if the government doesn't step in to deal with this, it's going to be the end. Like this is going to be the end if we don't deal with this. I don't quite understand where that's going to happen. Like what just people are slowly going to withdraw all of their deposits out of banks, like beyond $250,000 in the US or $85,000 in the UK. Like where's it going to go? And also, how are central banks now going to deal with interest rates? On the one hand, it's like it banks are almost reacting to rising interest rates. Like divers react to coming up from a very deep dive. Every 10 meters is causing, you know, worse and worse, abends, right? It's like every 25 basis, points to the Fed, high-cups, is causing more and more pain with the banks. It seems that cope with between our rock and a hard disk, because inflation is nowhere near the target level yet. It might have started to come down a lot, but other faced with a choice between just tolerating pretty high inflation, risking letting it get out of control, risking inflation expectations, starting to anchor, I like 8 or 10%, which would be a disaster. The face with the choice being that, letting the banks suffer even more and causing even more problem with the financial sector, which could lead to economic catastrophe. Is that where we're at at moment? I've never been much of a fan of Paul Krugman, but I think he's really jumped the shark now. I mean, that argument is transparently absurd, and the only thing I could say about it is, I wonder what he'd be making it if Donald Trump was still president, frankly, because it's ridiculous. It's absolutely absurd to compare a bunch of startups, 90% of which will fail, within three years, just naturally, with these behemoth auto manufacturers that have been around for years and have a key role to play in the global markets and so on. On the second point of the, I mean, to use the nerd term, the maturity, a maturity of the portfolios of the bank, why they were continuing to be in this long-term government debt and weren't recycling into short-term paper. I think everybody bought into the inflationist temporary narrative. And frankly, I don't really blame this on the banks. I get your point that these are highly paid executives that they should know better, that they should be more original thinking and so on, but I'm going to tell our listeners a bit of a secret. To a large extent, the banking game is run more by being counters than by investment-minded people, and in the larger institutions, people tend to just run with the pack. Now, that may not be the case around the edge. There's lots of very good people in finance who are very good investors, in hedge funds, in certain corners of the investment banking world and stuff, and they may cool country bats and they come up with ideas of their own. But for the most part, the banking sector runs in a herd and it's just a structure of the industry. It's how they hire. It is what it is. And so the blame really lies for that at the top. Once again, what the Federal Reserve, because part of their mandate is to manage those expectations. When they say they're managing expectations, you can translate that as they're giving marching orders to portfolio managers in all the major banks. That's what they're doing. And they kept messaging that inflation was transitory. And then the Fed decided it's not temporary anymore, and Bob's your uncle were off to the races. The third point, where is it going? Okay, well, there's a short term and a long term components to this. The long term component could be that the current banking model has been destroyed and that it's been destroyed by Federal Reserve policy. I wrote an article actually this week for the Daily Telegraph, in which I didn't quite argue that, but I at least showed that the policies that have been pursued since 2008 are even worse than their worst critics ever said they were. Everybody said the QE and Zerp was going to destroy the banking system was vindicated. The people who were saying it was going to create hyperinflation, we're talking nonsense, they always were, and they were not vindicated. But the more reasonable people who said it's going to destroy the banking and financial sector, have been vindicated. In the short term, where do we get the big blow up? As you say, this feels like death by a thousand cuts, well, quite, death by like seven large cuts more like, but where do we get the big blow up? Look, these problems are as we've outlined them, their massive stresses on the banking system, they're calling into question the basics of the banking model. But I think where the blow up is going to come, where the real blow up is going to come is when lending standards tighten, credit standards tighten, and the mortgage market blows up. And I think that's probably going to happen this year, probably in the third quarter, although I don't like making such a precise prediction, but I think it's around that. Given if you look at the construction, employment and construction, investment figures, when that blows the lid, we're going to get another 2008 style crisis, maybe not as large, but maybe larger. We don't know yet. And that will come in on top of this boiling of the frog that we're seeing now. And yeah, I mean, look, maybe it'll all work out, maybe things that we fixed by then, but you could well be facing there in the mother of all banking crisis. Yeah, and I think what would worry me about that is that there is a lot less political capital and political leeway now for governments to aggressively going and bail out and ask questions later. Of course, Silicon Valley depositors were bailed out, but I think it might have been a different matter if the bank itself had been bailed out. I'm not sure of Britain in the US. There's enough political capital after what happened last time. Nobody went to jail. Everybody got paid their multimillion dollar bonuses and everything went on, even even the new banking regulations like Dodd-Frank, well, you know, we're pretty light-touchable, watered down even from there. And I think there's been a kind of a simmering resentment about that that still lingers on today. So if in the third quarter, as you suggest, give a take a quarter or three, there's another banking crisis because the mortgage sector blows up. Then that, you know, there'll be two sets of people. There'll be one set of people who are bankers who have bailed out before and didn't really change their ways. I'll pay huge sums of money and suffer a lot of kind of simmering resentments against them and their trade and their industry. And they're going to have battered balance sheets that they're going to desperately need to repair and they might go out of business. And on the other side, there's going to be mortgage holders who are in negative equity, who are defaulting on their mortgages, who might be getting kicked out of their family houses, who are all sorts of difficulties. And in that sort of situation, it's going to be extraordinarily difficult for the government in whichever country, whether it be the UK or the US or elsewhere in Europe to say, yeah, it's the bankers who are, it's going to be rich people and bankers first again. Right? You know, it could be a real situation where there's just not enough political capital to actually bail out the bank or to help them much at all. Then we would really be in a situation where we might get ATMs, just not working anymore. People not being able to get out money. French Toast. In France, for several weeks now, there have been protests about the President of France, manual macrons, plans to raise the pension age, I believe from 62 to 64. This has been a long standing issue with the French, the French pension age is lower than those of places like Germany and the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. France has got long-term fiscal issues within five or six years. It's debt to GDP even under government forecasts is looking at around 120% of GDP for its sovereign debt. And one of the ways that successive French governments have thought about getting the country onto a long-term, more sustainable fiscal path has been through lifting the pension age. This is something that a lot of western governments have sought to do or to look at in the face of aging populations. However, this has been particularly unpopular in France, has been tried a few times and it's been unpopular a few times. And the latest attempt by Macron has been particularly controversial because he couldn't push the legislation through parliament, so he did it through essentially presidential decree. And it's caused outrage in France. And the protests have been going on for several weeks now. It seemed to be not quite as intense or serious as the Gilles de Jean or the Yellow Vest a few years ago. Excuse my French pronunciation. However, now in recent days, it really appears to have reached critical mass. Today, there was around upwards of, perhaps as many as a million people around France, drawn in protests of various types. There's been a lot of violence involved in this. There's been a lot of scenes of pretty horrific police brutality. And it seems to reach a critical mass in France now. I'm not sure whether this is just biannual French protest and riot. There seem to be a lot more prone to that than we are in Britain and even perhaps the Americans are. But one thing I sense really is that this isn't just going to be constrained to France. All of, certainly all of Western Europe and Eastern Europe as well probably. Perhaps even the US as well have been really struggling with the cost of living. First of all, we had inflation caused by supply chain dislocations and some of the COVID policies. And then of course, we had Europe's response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which have sanctions on Russia and of course, Russia's the supplier of all kinds of European raw materials which filter through to the whole economy. And of course, that's really had a big effect on the standard of living in Europe. And I feel that while perhaps the pensions are the kind of the immediate cause of this, I think this has been a long-running issue. And things are really starting to bubble to the surface. And we might see elsewhere in Europe. The proximate cause isn't going to be Russian sanctions. And the fact that I lifted the cost of living, it might be wages in a specific industry, it might be increased utility bills, it might be changes to employment law. But because people are suffering so much in Europe at the minute with worsening cost of living, they're being hampered from various different directions. High utility bills, high inflation, stagnant wages, all of these things are creating a great deal of political instability and social instability, I would say. But I think you wrote an article about this in Onhurst, didn't you, Philip? I don't really trust the pension narrative. It's convenient. It also fits in with the wonderful Anglo-Predulous that the French are always burning down their own country, which is somewhat true. But I do think this is different. Let's turn over a few things. First of all, are the French more likely to riot and revolt? Yes, they are. Are, for example, the British less likely, yes, they are. But in Britain right now, we have waved after wave of strikes. Very British strikes, the sort of strikes that you always see in Britain when people get pushed beyond the limit. Strikes of civil servants, strikes of unionized public sector workers and so on. So this isn't just a purely French thing. The second point to make is that some of the most shocking scenes that we've seen so far were not in Paris or in any major city, and they were not related to the pension fund, to the pension situation. They were in Saint-Soligne, which is a rural district in Western France. And they were not about the pension reforms. They were a bit of reservoir. The local authorities wanted to build a reservoir in the local area to irrigate local farms, and there was apparently local opposition to this, and it turned into a massive riot. So why is that? Why are all these riots sparking off with these, as you say, proximate causes, pension reforms? Okay, fine. Yes, 1995, a Shurak government tried to bring in pension reforms that was shut down. I get it. Pension reforms are difficult in France. But number one, they shouldn't result in a giant riot. And number two, the reservoir has nothing to do with that. Okay? So what are the commonalities here? The first commonality that stands out is that the really violent stuff seems to be the result of far-left agitators. That's been pretty well established, and the Jean-Darm\u00e9ry have been clearly communicating this plenty of evidence for it. But that just pushes the question one back. Leftist agitators are always in France. It's a big thing in France. It's also a big thing in Germany. Usually they can't whip up a mob. Why are they able to whip up a mob now? And I think that comes down to the cost of living crisis that you said. So there was a poll taken across Europe in September 2022. And in this poll, majority is across all four countries that were pulled. That was UK, France, Poland and Germany, said that they were worried about social unrest, ranging from 57% of people thought there'd be social unrest in the UK to 75% in Poland. So if you poll the average European right now, they will say, yes, I'm concerned about social unrest. And of course, they said why they're concerned about social unrest because of the cost of living decline that they were experiencing. And in this poll, only one person in 25% of the French population said that they were comfortably dealing with the cost of living crisis. So to me, this speaks volumes. And then when you take this data point and you read it back and into the events and France, it makes a lot of sense. The protests against the pension reforms were not the first protest. Since October, there have been regular protests with tens of thousands of people showing up, often organized by unions, protesting the cost of living crisis in France. It's right there. The paper is just don't really cover it. You have to go on kind of world socialist website or whatever to read about them. But you can see the pictures. You can see the video. There's tens of thousands of people there. They're peaceful. They're fairly orgely. But that's what's going on. So this is, this feels to me like it's a stirring resentment among the people of Europe. And it happens to catch fire in France first because of the idiosyncrasies of France. First of all, because of their serious opposition to pension reforms, which has provided a kind of a spark to this. And second of all, because the French are more likely to write. I actually think that's 100% the right analysis. We shouldn't forget that yesterday, as of recording, Germany had its biggest strike in years. Now, the German worker through the German unions has really seen as an exemplar when it comes to industrial relations. They are not prone to strikes. They're excellent at negotiating with the industries for whom they work. And yet here we are. They swallowed the hearts to reforms under Schroeder. They've swallowed relatively stagnant wages for years. And yes, and yet here we are. On a Monday this week, Germany has a huge strike. It's biggest since the very early 90s. So I don't think that I think it would be unfair to say that, oh, the French are complaining that they have to retire at, you know, that they're not going to be able to retire at 45. It's really not like that. Whatever their approximate causes, whether it be industrial relations between airports and workers or raising the pension age, or I think that what we have to remember is that workers since the financial crisis of 2008 have really suffered very stagnant wages, even as economies have grown, wages have remained absolutely stagnant. And yet now we have a re-emergence of inflation, which is squeezing people yet farther. And on top of that, we had the European response to the war in Ukraine, which led to higher energy prices, high utility bills, probably higher food costs as well. And, you know, after so many years of being squeezed, the workers really being hammered at the moment. And I think that's ultimately what is leading to this ground swell of protest, not just in France, but across Europe. And I don't think that this is going to remain constrained within France. And I think this is going to continue spreading out with. And we are in for a period of political and social instability. Bebe's Boo Boo. We're not just seeing protests in Europe. There are also big protests in Israel at the moment as well for the poor kids. And but I guess for a quite different reason. Yeah, I mean, these are definitely not related to the ongoing rolling energy crisis. As far as I know, and cost to living crisis, as far as I know, there is no energy crisis or at least no dramatic one. Protests are over judicial reform. The basics of this are that they want to greatly soften the ability of the Supreme Court to engage in judicial review, which is of course when a court looks at laws passed by the parliament and says these are illegal. These are not in keeping with our constitution or our basic laws. I think they have basic laws in Israel. And so the law doesn't stand. So they want to put in place a mechanism by which by getting a majority of votes, the Israeli parliament can overcome any aspect of judicial review. Now this speaks to a much broader change in Israeli society. Obviously the Netanyahu government is a conservative government backed by ultra conservatives of ultra orthodox Jews and so on. And interestingly, part of the bill, as I understand it, or at least as part of the reform package that they're discussing, they were considering letting a rabbinical courts. This is kind of traditional Jewish religious courts, the act as arbitrators in civil matters, using Jewish religious law if both parties consent. And I think that kind of puts the feeling on it. So I think the judicial reforms themselves were being set up or tilted in such a way that the increasing power of the religious communities and very conservative communities in Israel are concerned that if they get the right level of votes in the country, that the country won't be allowed to change in the direction that it wants to change or that they want it to change, then being the majority obviously, because the judges would shut it down. So the independent newspaper here in the UK, obviously it's quite left-wing and liberal and all that, but they had an Israeli writer. She says that Israel is bitterly quote unquote, quote bitterly maybe even irreparably divided and identity crisis is coming to a head and that it's really an existential question for the Israelis. So really you have these two groups in Israel, liberal Israelis who tend to be quite like Westerners in a lot of ways, live in the cities and the conservative and even ultra conservative elements. These people are the ones having all the children and they're trying to steer the country in the direction that they want to go. I think it's strange that the reforms are sometimes somehow called anti-democratic. In fact, they're the opposite there. They're actually pro-democratic. They're actually putting more power in the hands of the elected representatives and less power in the hands of the Supreme Court, as far as I understand. I'm not an expert on Israeli constitutional law, but that's the way I see it. I think they are potentially maybe anti-liberal in that sense because you don't want your parliament to be able to vote itself out of existence in favor of a generalissimo. Okay, so there's that concern as well. It's the idea of having a Supreme Court and basic or constitutional law depending on where you are and the ability of a Supreme Court to strike down legislation. But it's certainly quite pro-democratic. It gives much more power to the parliament, which is the elected representatives of the people. What I found really interesting about this though is that of course there was the issue with the elections and the coalitions and the re-elections just recently. But in Israel at the moment, you do have a growing and large number of the ultra-orthodox people who are for once of a more delicate term outbreeding the rest of the country by a prodigious rate. So it is in future going to be a much more conservative and much more religious, less secular country. I'm not surprised to hear that some people in Israel feel that the country is going through an identity crisis. You know, Kuala Vadas, Israel, like, where are you going? Like what sort of country are you going to be? What's really interesting from a multi-polarity point of view though is this. I'm guessing that the current coalition in Israel isn't necessarily to the liking of the foreign policy blob in Washington or the type of liberal metropolitan who run foreign policy across the Western world. I think in America, anti-Israeli sentiment has taken a lot longer to catch up among liberal progressives as it has in Western Europe where for many, many years now there's been a quite almost zealous, I would say, anti-Israeli are feeling among certainly the far left, but increasingly also the liberal metropolitan progressives are quite pro-Palestine and anti-Israeli and this kind of Israeli politics really infects a lot of that. Where is it America? Because of the power of the Israeli lobby, it's taken the American metropolitan liberals a fair bit of time to catch up to that, but I've sensed over the last couple of years, certainly since Biden's been in power, a big cooling off in relations between the Democratic Party and Israel as a concept. I don't think the necessary like Netanyahu from a personality perspective, as respect he doesn't get on so well with Joe Biden on a personal level. And what seems interesting is the big media in America, the kind of the papers of record, the Washington Post, New York Times, we do seem to be getting into the stage now where the US is you know, I think naturally they want to support the sorts of liberal people who are fueling these protests. I honestly would fear that these protests could, or if not these protests, a continuation along this trajectory could be the Kishoggi moment. That created an outrage against the Saudis. It really did damage to the relationship between the West, especially America and the Saudis. And you know, since then the Saudis have effectively left the West to the sphere of orbit and they're joining the bricks and so on. These kind of diplomatic matters are very, very sensitive and they have to be handled with a great degree of sensitivity. You say that you've picked up, you know, anti, definitely anti conservative Israel, maybe even anti-Israel sentiment in America, among the American liberal left. I think you're absolutely right. I think it actually goes back to Obama. It was stewing there for a longer time, but you're right. It wasn't there as forcefully as it has been in Europe, but I think Obama, where at least the Obama era opened the box on that whole question. And I think things have been in kind of stasis or equilibrium because the way the world set up, you know, Israel were an ally, Israel were extremely happy with the way politics was going in the Middle East, at least, you know, they thought long-term and if the Republicans got enough influence and if the Iran deal never went through, there was a path there for them that they saw. All that ended two weeks ago. We spoke about it on the show. The Chinese are brokering these new relationships most notably between Iran and Saudi Arabia. And obviously the wedge that America tried to drive between Iran and Saudi Arabia, I mean, it was part of American foreign policy as a kind of a divide and conquer and make sure that Saudis on your side and that the other major power in the region isn't. But the Israelis love this deal. And I think we mentioned when we discussed it recently that there were leaks from Israeli diplomats and so on, which said to the Americans, you know, you guys are weak, you've lost control over the foreign policy in this region and so on. So the Israelis are already raging about new geopolitical formations in the Middle East. And now what's happening is the entire Western media or a great deal of the Western media are lining up behind these frankly anti-government protests. I mean, I saw that Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister there, said in a televised speech that he was putting away the judicial reforms, walking them back because he wanted to prevent quote an Israeli civil war unquote. That's if even if he's using slight rhetoric there, if that's how much the Israeli leadership are spooked by these protests, they seize them as a threat to the state. So the West needs to be really careful about how it handles these situations. They've already lost Saudi Arabia to something like this. In fact, something far less dramatic because although the killing of a journalist is horrible, it's not a threat to a state anywhere. If the Israeli party empower currently sees those kind of protests as serious civil unrest and a threat to the Israeli state, then they could lose interest in people who start backing those kind of protests in their country. I think it's really time for Western countries to step back and start questioning how much they want to not interfere but at least get involved in or take positions on domestic national issues within allied countries, especially allied countries in such difficult regions and who've just experienced massive diplomatic upheavals all around them. Yeah, I don't think it's too hard to imagine the Israelis panicking a bit at the moment because maybe panicking is too strong a word but starting to look extremely concerned about the situation because you've had a Saudi Iranian debt homes which is really the biggest shift because the ongoing conflict between Saudi Arabia and Iran was what was tearing apart the region after the US invasion of Iraq. But then you've also had a Saudi Syria debton which makes sense because Syria is the biggest ally of Iran and Saudi Arabia was involved in various ways in the Syrian civil war. As we mentioned a couple of weeks ago on the part, the Russians have been working very hard to build better relations between the Saudis and the Syrians but also crucially the Turks and the Syrians. So if you had some sort of detons between Erdogan and Assad or whoever comes after Erdogan and Assad that really the whole region would be stabilized to a great degree all of the issues that had led to the division and violence of the Arab part of the region would be solved. Now while the Arab Muslims were fighting among themselves that was fairly beneficial to Israel that kept Israel reasonably secure in relation to a unified and peaceful Arab world but now that seems to be changing very swiftly and at the same time and at the same time it seems that the liberal metropolitan wing of American politics is also starting to cool on Israel and come more toward the European position on Israel which is another big issue. So it's reasonable to imagine the Israelis thinking, well this is not looking good for us at all and on top of that you have these huge protests which I'm sure they're not and I don't mean to imply that they are so don't take this the wrong way Philip but they do resemble to a reasonable degree a lot of the color revolutions in eastern Europe which brought down governments and changed whole political systems in eastern Europe. I'm pretty sure that this is not a color revolution but it's the same sort of people protesting about a similar sort of issue and they have in the past brought them down so I think that really the West it has to be a lot more delicate in dealing with this situation than it has been with other situations I would say because it is reasonable to think that the Israelis could be getting a little bit nervous about the situation that's unfolding around them and Israel is a nation that's acutely aware of a relatively precarious strategic position far more so than we have in Britain or America we probably couldn't possibly comprehend the way that they feel in terms of their security so it is something that we're going to have to deal delicately with. Look the fact of the matter is a great deal of Middle Eastern strategy of the West was lost just in the past month and if Israel is ever lost if they turn around to you know China because China is the big deal maker in the region now and maybe China can get the medial where they can get something reasonable vis-a-vis around or whatever if they turn around and they do that the Middle East is over it's closed for business to the West completely it already may be partially closed at least for next few years but it'll be closed for business and no matter what people think about green-flying cars we're still reliant on hydrocarbons we've just cut off Russian hydrocarbons okay they're not flowing into the West anymore are we going to flow cut off the Middle East as well maybe not cut it off but are we going to not have any influence in that region because we care so much about domestic politics in Israel a country that many of us have never even visited before I'm sure it's a beautiful country but that's the reality of it it's as you say you're not taking a side in Israel I'm not taking a side in Israel it's not my country I just think that this is hebristic actually I think it's hebristic and it's dangerous and people need to pump the brakes a little bit and we need to separate our domestic politics from our foreign policy and our diplomats and our foreign ministries and so on need to put more effort into to separate those two things because the rest of the world isn't going to be like us no matter how much we want it to be we are fresh from a huge victory we are",

Ten positive steps to improve your life. Then open the first page and just in... Times New Roman font, wipe, wipe page, black text just says, don't. Oh! Mmm. Yeah, then the rest of the book is just pictures of Hobo clowns, like the Hobo clown paintings. But instead of looking sad, they look very angry. And one of them looks horny. I mean, you know, typical, typical printing area that occasionally happens, you know. I've made some books, I've worked on books. It's very typical for that to accidentally happen with a book. Yeah. You know, it's like an auto-correct area, you know. You type in some self-help words and instead you get stopped on a sad clown. They've got scratch and sniff... On it. Do you remember that? I do remember scratch and sniff, yeah. Scratch and sniff? I am curious how sad clown scratch and sniff smells. I mean... Potash. Several pages is just potash and... whiskey. I mean, I say it scratch and sniff. The book's just been soaked in whiskey. Every copy. Well, I mean, that's a selling point if I've ever heard of one. Yeah, well, I mean, you can't suck the pages. It's dry by the... You know when you like make a... When a kid makes a treasure map. Just because you can't suck the pages doesn't mean you can't rip them out and chew them and the whiskey's probably in there. And aroma therapy, we all know, is very popular. Now, imagine if instead of candles, you just had a stack of books in your home that produced a pleasant aroma of ash and whiskey. Yeah. And a little bit of puke. Oh, I mean, yeah, there is one... One page and you don't even need to scratch it really. Because they covered the whole page with scratch and sniff smell of, well, there's no other way to say it. Puke. I lied there. There's many ways to say vomit. Like just sick, sick. A rainbow yarn is one of my favourites. But yeah, the whole page, you don't need... Like, it's pungent. It almost overpowers the whiskey.

It wasn't even something that I was like when it was always available, I was like, I'm going to go bowling all the time. It just, but now that it hasn't been available to me for so long, I really have this urge. I've been having that this week. I've been having the like, the very small things that I've just been like, un-um-miss things that I could do previously. Yeah. Give me mundane outside activities, please. I look good now. I want to go out. Yeah, fucking hell. I managed to get into an XL shirt, which is huge for me, but not huge for me in another way. I got into tires, fuck, but... That's incredible. Oh, you should see the figure. Oh my god, I've got the most honest tips in Philadelphia. Those hips do not lie. Do you see the state of it? I don't know where that came from. Hips for days. I mean, there's fucking that a figure that is. So... Hips for months. Fucking hell. Oh, folks, wait till you see me at the Polyam co-party. Oh. On April 24th, you can see it on a live stream, 3PM ET, on April 24th, go professional wrestling on Twitch. Or an hour sooner, when me and Conrad will be doing a little pre-show before that happens. That's right. Yeah, Lauren Conrad will be pre-showin' it up. Oh, I might see FMV can get me some, like, promos and stuff and you can put them in. That'd be great. Yeah. That'd be great. But yeah, yeah, I'll... Hopefully it gets into... gets here in time, but the dress I have picked out is something I... Not even I am ready for. It's gorgeous. I'll for people who always ask, by the way, Torrid or LOQEE, ELOQII, that's where I get much of my stuff. Also, Torrid of the two of them sounds like the long to go for, because Torrid apparently put pockets in fucking everything. Yeah, EloQEE'd isn't so good at pockets, but Torrid puts pockets on most things. That's where I got the rainbow shirt, which I'm actually wearing now, the rainbow-played, and the pink and purpley played as well. But yeah, a lot of my cool stuff comes from there. Who was to talk about a video game this week? Anyone? Oh, see now, when you say that, it seems to be implying that you're expecting me to... Conrad Conrad, would you rather that I was like, okay, it's time to talk about Cames Conrad, it's your turn. Would you be more likely to do it if I directly told you or if I left the door open so that only you were really in a position to walk through it? Oh, I do actually prefer the latter, because it allows me to then just say nothing and insert an incredibly awkward silence into this. Conrad, you played Undermine and Rita Boy and Gator Robota, I tell you about one of them. All right, so yeah, well, okay, we'll start with Undermine, because talked about it before, we could breeze through it a little bit. I finally did a quote-unquote finish yet. You went back and beat the bosses that you kind of skipped over before. I went back and beat the bosses, and then, of course, there's a final encounter that that opens up, and I did that, and actually, once you've completely beaten all of the bosses, because the bosses do not return once they're dead, which is a cool feature. Yeah. And still surprised me somehow, because I had done the last boss before I'd done the third and fourth, and I came back to the last boss chamber, I was like, oh, yeah, that's right, it's dead. Yeah, it's an interesting way to have a game about multiple playthroughs, right? Right. But once you have defeated them all, it responds them all back in. Yeah, you know, I think that needed to happen, but I like that for a first playthrough that it's like, we're not going to make you fight all of them over and over again every time you go to the place, and I think that worked well. Yeah, and I'm in the middle of my, you know, now second run through, and I expect that I'll just beat them all again on this run. Yeah. It's not presenting a tremendous challenge any longer. Mm-hmm. Now, each time you cycle it, it's supposed to ramp up the difficulty. I can't say I've noticed it's significantly more difficult from one to two, but yeah. You know, it's fine. It's not the kind of step up I would have anticipated. Yeah, especially considering, you know, the sort of leap in difficulty, and a lot of that is just down to not having experienced the mechanics in individual levels before that contributes to the difficulty you're first encounter with a boss. Those things are spikes. Yeah. But that's, it's more experiential spikes than it is anything to do with the game actually being all that more difficult. Yeah. And so I'll see how many loops probably it takes before I'm like, okay, this is actually getting to be a little hard. There's also the other mine, which is I don't, I'm not even clear on what that is. Neither am I. I've yet to, I've yet to work it out. It seems to be a, some, you know, somewhat more random and challenging, at least based on the description of it. It seems like there's a little more intense waves of enemies involved. And now I have sort of poked around a wiki a little bit because I'm curious about the familiars. I've not done that yet. Did you work out what the ghost does? I did work out what the ghost does. Well, the fact is the ghost does. So what's interesting is about the familiars and the way they work is that at every level they gain some new ability. Now in the case of the canary, which is the one you start with, it just collects gold faster. And so it seems as though your effects are going to be whatever it did before it now does faster. But it's actually whatever it did before it does better. In the case of the ghost, and this was easy to overlook if you've already bought potion slots and not paying too close attention to how many potion slots you have, but yeah, it's potion slot. Oh, yeah. Oh, I did not tweak that at all. And at the second level, I can't recall exactly what it does. But at the third level, it functions like the blessing or the relic that will sometimes duplicate a key when you use one. Oh, yes. So you'll get another potion sometimes when you use a potion with the ghost. I've unlocked a few others. There's a gin that I really like, really like because it tells you where there are secret rooms. And it does this with an audio indicator when you come into a room. And it will indicate the wall that shining. You know, it will indicate with a shine automatically that there is a hidden passage in that room. Now at level two, it'll show you the rocks that have staircases underneath them. Yes. At level three, occasionally when you go into a room, it'll just drop a key or a bomb for you. Every, every few rooms, it will drop that. So and it's great. And it's especially cool because I got the curse that makes it harder to find secret rooms. But that doesn't change the sound effect. So I hear that coming into the room. I know there's something in there. If I blow up enough shit, I'm going to find the thing out. Yeah. And I got 53 bobs on this run right now. So we ain't fucking around. I'm really, really enjoying still playing it. And I've learned to use the jump that I did not like in ways that are functional and practical and feel natural now. Yeah. And that was the biggest stumbling like also there's a, I didn't know about the relic that's in the fast travel room guys. Oh, yeah. Oh yeah. Speeds up your movement when you're not in combat. Yes, which is really nice to picking up gold, for example. Yeah, man. It didn't bother me. The speed that I moved, but having it is a nice quality of life improvement. As soon as you have it, you appreciate its presence. Yeah. Yeah. So anyway, under mine's still good game. I'm going to keep playing it for a bit. I'm still playing it on and off. Like it's certainly not my favorite rogue like by any stretch of the imagination, but it is, it feels unique. And there is enough here that I have stuck with it. It's definitely in the good tear. Yeah. Yep. Yep. Anyone else played anything else this week? I have played games. You've played games? Well, I know you have it in the topic list. Yeah, I say played. Yeah. I say played. I don't know if I could call my experience without writers so far playing it. Now look, Arlant, you know, many people have said they've had no problems with it. Okay. I cannot provide critique from the perspective of someone I don't know and whose eyes I do not have. I can't like John Malkovich me way into your head. So, you know, my experience has been shit house. It takes ages just to log in. Yeah. Even though you could just play it offline, but they've made it always online and they don't seem to apply the same standard to them. Fuckin' selves. I've always said that. The always online requirement is only for us, but people who fucking paid to get in took me days, days to get into a game, right? And when I did, I spawned falling through the sky like it was a steam asset flip. Yeah. And then I eventually like got out of that and then I was like under the map and I could hear gameplay happening. When I don't try and get into a multiplayer game, which is specifically what I wanted the game for, because I played the demo and was like, oh, this will be fun in multiplayer, not so much in single player. Single player is the best I can do and it's not all that fun on my own. This is the problem I have had with it as well. Is that the demo was fun, but if the launch game is less playable than the demo was, something's gone really wrong. Yeah, I mean, look, I paid money for that fucking game and I wasn't able to play it for days and I've still not had a good experience. The servers functionally worked when you were giving it to people for free, but not when they've paid for it. Yeah, I don't, I mean, it's just, oh god, I am... Oh god. I could have spent that money on boglands, more and more, but no, I'm very disappointed and people are like, oh, are you really that surprised? And I'm like, yeah, I always can't believe it because I will always expect better than this shit. So yes, I will always, the day I stop being shocked by it is the day I pack it all in, because it should always be shocking. That's why I still treat micro transactions in $60 games with as much content as I do loot boxes and everything else because just because they pushed the envelope, doesn't make where the envelope was acceptable. And outright does is, I mean, I haven't felt this way about a game since that, what was it, steel battalion on the connect where I'm like, this is a straight-up defective product. Oh, the one where I had to hold my arm up for like 10 minutes, like getting ready to ready a signal and then when the man comes past it, I'm supposed to put my arm down so the gun will shoot. But like, I put the arm down and it doesn't register and now it's like, no, you fail, put your arm up for another 10 minutes. It should have had a full product recall, that's steel battalion. I still maintain that full product recall. It was the first or second video game I ever got sent by a PR company to review. And oh my goodness, my entire review was this is a fundamentally broken thing that just is not playable. Oh. God, back in them days, I used to get the, even though I was a reviews editor, I didn't have the contact so I was stuck with the shit work. I was stuck with the, I was stuck with dark void and damn nation. I was doing unpaid work for, um, oh God, what culture. And I think I was the only person that was sending games to, I would assume. Because back to back, I got sent that and speck-ops the line. And I don't know how I get a game that good and a game that bad back to back unless they don't have anyone else to send games to. Yeah. Bloody hell. Bloody hell. What was the first game I ever reviewed professionally? Dynasty Warriors 6. It was either Dynasty Warriors 6 or Devil May Cry 4. Meh. It was going to be Mass Effect. But, and I actually agree looking back the reviews editor who was there at the time said, this is just a hate-screet. There's no criticism here. And it really wasn't. It was just a lot of me talking about how the car feels like it's driving on spunky water. So there, that's a nice little bit of reminiscing. Yeah. So yeah, anything else you want to say about our readers? Not really. I want to like it. I like the character class I picked, but it's a character class that really feels like it'd come into its own in multiplayer because it's a long range one with like turrets and stuff like that. So I would rather not have everything focused on me when I'm trying to keep distance. I know there's the whole you push forward and the cover isn't for them. But the character I've got with the sniper rifle and everything. The cover's actually pretty good sometimes. And that's another thing with that game is there's still... I'm not sure if it's an identity crisis because I feel like it is doing what it wants it's just not quite... It's just something of little contradictory about it where you're supposed to push forward, but maybe it's just a function of playing single player, but they swarm you a lot of the time. I often feel overwhelmed by just their numbers and the amount of bullets coming my way. And oh yeah, that's another problem with this. It's another one of those looters shooters, which means the loot is garbage. I love assault rifle and shot gun. Great loot. Great loot gang. So yeah, that's how I do so far. I don't know why I've been... No, I do know why I've been persevering. Fucking 60 bucks. Fucking. Yeah. So I played a thing this week. You better of? Yeah. So you know her last week I've updated you on the ever evolving story of cooking my mukuk star. Oh, it never stops. The party never stops. Oh, the party never stops. So since last week I now actually have a copy of the game. Oh yeah. Yes for. So I've played it. I'll get into playing it in a second. I've done a couple of things of note having had a look at like the disc and the box and just had a bit of a look. Yeah, the theory that this was stock they made a year ago and to just like, hey, is no one looking out it goes. Doesn't hold water. The discs all have copyright 2021 on them. So this is a recent thing. The box still references office creates and specifically says that this is licensed by office creates. So either the legal situation has changed in the last year or just a straight-up lie has been printed on the box. Those are the two options. So yeah, I've been playing a bit of cooking my mukuk star and here's the weird thing. I expected this to be the most like rush job port of all time because everything's suspicious about how suddenly this appeared with no warning. Led me to think that they were like, okay, let's just get it done and out the door and hope no one stops us. This is a better port than the switch version from a year ago. Oh yeah? Like it is, it's not good. But it is better. They have clearly made an effort to do more than the bare minimum. Oh, pushing the bow out. Yeah. So where the switch version you either have to play in sticks and buttons mode or motion mode and you have to stick with that. This has a combination. Some of the inputs are sticks and buttons. Some are motion controls. There is touch controls with the little touch pad on the PlayStation controller, which is more than the switch ever got. Even in handheld mode where that console has a touch screen, they never gave it touch controls with the PlayStation ports, got them. The loading times infinitely faster. Very nice for speedrunning. I know no one else on the planet cares about this, but on my very first attempt, like with no practice on the PS4 version, I was shaving like 30 seconds per recipe off of my personal best times. So that going to shake up the very tiny speedrunning community I have for this game makes sounds out the controller. It changes the light and color on the controller when you do in bad or you do in well and mama shouts at you out the controller. Wow. The analog stick inputs register better than the switch version. The their trying is, is yes, quite admirable. Is the word I think? No. That's the thing is like as someone who has played probably more than anyone else in the world of the switch version, I can't fault the quality of the PS4 port. It is a technically better game in a lot of regards. It's gone from being mediocre to like, yeah, that's like a six added. It's gone from like a five to a six, maybe six and a half added 10. It's it's moving up in the world. You know, it's it's fine. It's it's good enough. I mean, you know what? I thrive on good enough. So yeah, cooking one with cook star. Mm-hmm. Look, if you're someone who's never owned an Nintendo system and really wants to play a bunch of cooking mini games, this is the first time the series has ever been on an Nintendo console and you know what? If you've never played another cooking mama to compare it with, it's it's not a bad mini game collection of do silly making food. It's always good, Chrissy, like, like good for a game when the criticism begins with now look. Well, that's the thing. If you've ever played another cooking mama, you're going to play this and go, oh, it's not as good as the other ones. Yeah. If you're playing it in isolation, which as the first time it's ever come to a Sony console, you might be playing it in isolation. I mean, it's a it's a few hours of silly making recipes with motion controls and wiggle in your finger on a touchpad. Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle. It's not a terrible time. Maybe we're bubble, bubble, bubble. It's no steel battalion connect. Oh, god. What is? Yeah, except for steel battalion connect. I'm still trying to get a fucking answers about what the fuck's gone on with this game. But investigate reporting has continued. I now know where planet entertainment who made this are based. And I'd given some leeway because initially I had an assumption of because of the communication that was going on. I wasn't sure if there was a communication barrier existing. I don't feel like that's the case. I feel like I now have confirmation that they are just being obstructive. But I am contacting via a translator office creates and I'm going to try and keep getting to the bottom of this weird mystery. Oh. Also the game is four times the size on PS4 for no discernible reason. Ah, spyware. Russian spyware. It's literally four times the final size for not much discernible difference. What resolution does it run at? As far as I'm aware, just 1080p. Yeah. They're agents. They're working for nod. There's not such a technical leap between the switch and PS4 that I would expect a quadrupling of memory size required. No, no increase in terror. Flops. It runs at 60 frames a second, which is noise. Fucking hell. It's weird. It has no limits. Okay, weird thing I've noticed. Again, this is just me whaffling about I think that I find interesting. Yeah. Some of the mini games go by faster, not because of faster loading times, but I think because of the fact that they've doubled the frame rate of the switch version, but they've not inserted new frames. Played certain animations at essentially double speed, which makes certain mini games go by much faster. That is a way of doing that. A shaving time off the speed runs though, right? Well, exactly. It is. The only other person who is actively speedrunning this game doesn't have a PS5 in it loads fastest on PS5, so my record's a currently... Yeah. Oh, yeah. Ha, ha, ha, ha. I would probably be the speedrun holder on this until PS5 is a more available. Brilliant. Come on, Rhett, what have you played this week? Come on, Rhett. Well, I played Gatto Robato. Yeah, tell us about this. Have you seen this? Yeah, I have this. I believe on Switch. It's on Game Pass, but it's leaving like in a week, I think, and so it wound up in the leaving soon. And I think I had had it like, I had my eye on it on steam for a long time or something, because I recall seeing it. It's just, it's a Metroidvania. Yeah, a little white, a black and white game of white. Hey, what if a cat was Metroid? Well, I mean, I say you say black and white, it's monocle. Oh, I've played this. Yeah, I've played this quite a while back. Yeah, yeah, I just hadn't gotten around to it. It's published by Devolver. And you are a adorable little kitty who's trying to help their human, who is a space pilot, escaped from a ship crash while investigating a research center. Yeah. And what's cool about it is that, well, for one, it's like a, it's a really compact experience. It's very short. You know, you can clear it in a few hours. It's not very long. The areas are not super expansive and there's not a ton of hidden stuff. And it makes it pretty obvious to you for the most part where all of that hidden stuff is. Just looking at the map, it's pretty plain. So it's not hard to 100% it either, which I like. But also, I think the mechanics are really kind of paired down and simplified. So like where a Metroidvania would be like, okay, what's the morph ball equivalent here? You start with that because the cat is small, right? Little cat. Yeah, you're a cat. What about a wall jump? Well, the cat starts with that too. And so you can, in the cat form, immediately scale walls. You're just very vulnerable. One hit will kill you in the cat. And soon into the game, you get the roboto of the Gato-Roboto equation. And in the robot suit, you have offensive capability. Well, I flip the bird, say, racial slurs. Like how offensive is the robot's cape at the carry on? Gotcha. When you also have defensive capability because the mech can take multiple hits. And that expands over time as you collect health upgrades for the mech. Other upgrades to the mech you'll get missiles, which are used to last through certain barriers and deal more damage in combat. And one smart way it approaches that is a coolant system for the missiles, as opposed to an ammunition system to limit you. And so you can really fire two missiles before it overheats. And you have to wait for the meter to drain all the way down. Or you can more slowly parcel them out one at a time. And later that gets upgraded to having up to three missiles before it overheats. Then you'll get a double jump. But the double jump is also your screw attack. And the screw attack, and this works really well too. Because when you bounce off of an enemy, that immediately refreshes your screw attack jump. So you can use that to more effectively navigate environments. And that gets taken to a whole other level when you get the dash. Because then you double jump to a dash, you get your double jump again. And so it makes it very easy to pick up, feel like progression is quick. And then the whole thing is over. And it doesn't outstay, it's welcome. It allows it to remain charming and funny without feeling like, all right, this is getting old. Yeah. So yeah, I'm really pleased with it. If you have game pass, you should check it out while it's still available. The animation's beautiful. Yeah, it's a good little game. Yeah, I remember liking it well enough. I didn't get super far, but yeah, I'm glad you like it. Yeah, it was good. Yeah, a little keycap. I have to interrupt with a piece of breaking video game news that you all need to know. So, you know, Lady Dimitrescu, the big vampire lady that's like. She do a big starpie, yeah. 10 feet tall, and she do a big stoppie. Yeah. A slow beef told me I should change my name to Lady Dimitrescu, on Twitter. I may do that in a minute. So it's funny, Conrad, that you mentioned, you know, doing a step on people. It has been officially announced how big Lady Dimitrescu's feet are. Oh, yeah. Because, of course, they have. I'm not going to tell you the actual size. All you need to know is that she has bigger feet than Shaquille O'Neal. Yeah. That's the headline that she's got bigger feet than Shaq. Now look, the best part of all this isn't the first, isn't the, you know, these horny-making stats. It's the continued cracking on by Capcom that they don't know what's up. Yeah. They don't know why people want to know this. They don't get why people are excited. We're so confused why you would want to know, but she has 17.3 inch feet. Yeah. It's your curious. I can just imagine like Capcom reps firing panties out of a t-shirt. Karen just saying who's horny? What? So, yeah, in the world of Resident Evil 8, there is a company producing Shaquille O'Neal size high heels. And I'm very happy with that knowledge. Oh, yeah. That's great to know. I mean, Jesus Christ, I have trouble finding shoes. I don't want to deal with the zombies and like the leeches that fill up the Louisiana families and stuff, but put like, if they did him a chestgoo could tell me where she's shoe shops, I'd be really appreciative. Exactly. Because she ain't going down fucking clocks. Is that clear? Jim, have you played anything else this week? I've played games beyond your world, just imaginings. I've been gaming the system as well. Yeah. Yeah, that's how I get wrestling titles. And it's how, oh god, I don't know if I've mentioned this. I've not mentioned it on the podcast. So here's the first time I'm going to. I just happen to be, and be day, the first non-sysholder of a Pittsburgh promotions top title, you know. So first, I'm an Equatorial Hardware, Mr. Cipian Alabama. So no big deal. Play Disco Elysium Directors can't. Oh, I've been playing a bit of this. Oh, I need to get that. I need to get into that again. I was curious how it is on the console. I appreciate the voice acting a lot, playing it on a console. Yeah. The voice acting I'm finding is throwing me off the increased voice acting. Because descriptions aren't, and some bits still aren't. And the flitting in and out is throwing me more than it did last time. Oh, I've not had the same experience. I've been enjoying the voice acting. The character voice acting in particular, I very much enjoy. That game has very much the feel of playing a tabletop game. Oh, yeah. I mean, there's still that. Yeah. Having some of the non-dialogue stuff voice acted kind of had the feel of here's the DM telling me about what's going on. And I kind of, I kind of dug that. Yeah. I also feel like the main sort of narration is really, for me, it's like really flat. It's just so plain and explanatory. Also, I would have liked all the different, I mean, this would have been impossible because there's so many. But I would have liked different voices for the different stats and everything. But that would be such a big undertaking for the amount. So I'm fully aware I shouldn't lean heavily on that. But I mean, it doesn't control great on the PS5, sort of a lot of flicking the right stick to highlight things. But it loves to highlight things that aren't the thing that is like right near you. And it can just get annoying. The game itself is still great, you know, playing it a little bit different from last time. Didn't decide to go with the big ego centric superstar cop this time, doing more of a self-loving thing, just to see where that goes. I'm at a point, I'm not super far into this run. I'm in the apartment at the moment, having spoke to Martin Martin A's. And I've added the thought of starting the communist rebuild. See where that one pops off too. So I'm looking forward to going through it again. So that was just going this year. It's a nice excuse to go back through that game. Hell yeah. The other thing I've really been playing a lot of again this week is I'm still playing a bunch of monsters. Oh, you, I am. Yeah. I played with you. What was it last night on the stream? Yeah, yeah. We fought Magnum Aulo a couple of times on stream. Magnum Aulo, Rathion. Yeah, I was trying to get my Magnum Aulo armor set together, I think. Did you get the Magnum Aulo, Mala, Mala, Mala? I did get my Magnum Aulo, Mala, Mala, Mala, Mala. Brilliant. I got my rare 1% drop I'd been looking for on stream. I am wearing a big pumpkin suit, so I'm done. The game's won. It's free, fantastic. I have spent my day today doing a bunch of fighting of, I figured what it's called, starts with a, with a Z. Uh, it's the big electric. Yes, dog thing. I think it's in court. It's fucking horrible. It's one of the worst ones. It's really hard to like join, find join requests for it because I think people are fucking avoiding it. So I enjoy fighting it, but I did have that experience today. Like I couldn't find an online match for it. Yeah, I don't think people want any part of it. And I don't blame him. I enjoy it. The damage it does. In my experience, it's been the most fun creature to solo so far. Oh my god, you're so low in here. Yeah, I'm so low in it. It's the damage. It gets me in like, to it. Yeah, it is one of those where you have to really keep an eye on your health and really micromanage your health. I don't want to keep an eye on anything. I want to, I want the game to be easy, Laura. That's fair. I've been really enjoying it mainly because I've been playing with the charge blade and there's a lot of moments in its moves. It's like charging in energy to do its electric stuff. Where it'll sort of stay still for a second and have like little dots of energy going into it. And that's a great time for me to set up my very satisfying big electrical swing attack. Yeah. It gives me nice openings to do the thing that makes my weapon feel cool. That's good. Also, I've got a charge blade now that does red and black lightning whenever it does its charge attacks. And that makes me feel very powerful. Nice. That's what you want. That's what you want. You want to feel ridiculous. That's what I like about Monster Hunter. Is that point where you're like, I look and feel utterly ridiculous. I've been working on builds this time. Yeah. So I've got my pumpkin build because it adds a lot of fire attack. So I got a bell that has fire attack and that's good. Then I've got my mushroom build. Where it's only a two-piece armor. I've got to find some other good stuff to go with it. But it's like mushroom buns for your head and then mushroom shoulder pads. And that lets you eat mushrooms. And then I get my toxic fungus axe, which is a big one. The saxophone also covered in mushrooms. And that is the mushroom one. And then I'm working on a heel one. I've just got to get the armor because it does a big boost to your recovery. And then I'm going to use the Magiya charm. Which does a lot of recovery. I'm using the horn still. I really like the hunting corn because it turns you into a bard. Yeah, it's wonderful. I always enjoy playing in groups where there's a hunting horn in the group. Very much appreciate it. I have been having a great time dressing up my dog to make it look like a legendary Pokemon. No, I can't. You can get that. Yeah. You can really get some Pokemony looks. My one basically looks like Jonathan Crane, but as a dog. The pumpkin stuff so good. Yeah, I'm still playing my way through very slowly. I'm on rank five, both on single player and multiplayer because I insist on getting every full set of armor available before I move on to a new creature. My god. And you know what? Your schedule is lucky. They don't have shiny versions of the armor. Honestly, yeah. That's the thing. Like I've been playing. This has been filling the role of shiny Pokemon hunting for me recently, where it's like, yeah, I want to repeatedly do the same thing. Until I've completed my collection and then I move on. I mean, it's good for that. Like, even I don't collect everything, but I want anything that is stupid and makes me look absurd. Or, you know, adorable, like my little pumpkin hat. My favorite stupid outfit right now is the one off of the white penis dragon. You know the one I mean? I know the one you mean. The extendable neck, noise, penis dragon. Horrible white palithly cheap thing. Yeah. With the very sort of like latexy looking skin. So the female armor set for that creature looks like medical fetish outfit, where it's like, oh, what if you had a shiny white latex nurses outfit? And I'm like, oh, that's wonderful. I mean, this what you want. The hunting horn weapon for that thing is just its face. Like, it's just a big like, like, not trumpet, like, like bugle looking thing. And the big, like, sound hole at the top is just it's mouth with the teeth. It's fucking ghastling. I've seen it, and I don't approve of it. It's not good. It's not a good time. Yeah. So I'm working it through it slowly. Like, I'm behind most of the people I know were getting through it, but I'm having a great time. I completely forgot about the village stuff. So I'm on like rank seven in the hub. And I'm like, I think I may have just got to rank three on the village. Ha ha ha ha ha. Ah, I still don't like the rampage missions. They are. Yeah, they're, I haven't done many because it's just not appealing. No, I've done the ones that required for progression through the ranks, but yeah, I don't want to stop playing Monster Hunter to play something else. That's fair. I want to play Monster Hunter. I don't want to stop Hunter. Yeah, honestly, like it's, it's a very different experience. I said last week, I like horde mode type stuff. I like that wave based stuff, but not for big beasties. It just, it clashes a bit too much for me. Yeah. Oh, there you come. Red, have you played anything else this week? Ah, yeah, I play well. You already told everybody what I played. Remember, you just ran down the list. There's no surprises left. That's your fault for not, you know, telling us what you played when I opened the door for you. You really, maybe I didn't play anything. So I played Nareda Boy, which I guess just came out. And it's a 2D action platformer that has like, I mean, it's got its tron inspiration written all over it. Like, it doesn't try to hide it. The box art cover art, whatever you want to call it, is a dude in the tron post with the disc overhead and the beam. It's tron shit. But you control Nareda Boy, who is, I guess, a teenage boy in the early 80s that's pulled into computer system. As some sort of last defense against a corrupted program that's trying to dominate the whole network or something. There's a lot of text at the beginning. Like, a lot of dialogue with programs and the motherboard, which is the entity that's, you know, supposed to be guiding you, vaguely hints to the mechanics and figures controlling the world. It's one of those sci-fi things that I find kind of frustrating because like, when the writers feel this need to spend this much time on the foundational groundwork to prepare for later concepts, I get nervous about how much time is going to be spent later in the game when I'm actually engaged and would prefer to keep playing it. And then there was another creeping dread thing that I experienced where I got, you know, one of those achievement sounds when I had to enter a code sequence in. That was slightly tedious. And I thought, oh crap. Because I read the Achievement. It says, do this for the first time. I'm like, oh, no, no. I'm not going to be happy about that. But they think the thing that like most has me kind of is that the platforming is very springy that has floaty horizontal control. Oh, yeah. And that's kind of difficult to compensate for with the level of accuracy that the game is demanding for all of these bottomless pits that are in it. Mm-hmm. But the combat seems fun. After a too long meandering around in my opinion, you get a multi-use weapon that has melee attacks. Got a good dash mechanic. You do a dash and swing sword combo. Things pretty cool. There's, you charge it up and there's a baseball bat type swing to it also. And then the ranged options have a shotgun blast. And then a really powerful beam that just goes all the way across the screen depending on whether you tap or charge. And those just have a slowly regenerating ammo thing that I'm assuming expands fairly considerably. I haven't found a lot of interest in using the ranged stuff yet, but maybe if I keep playing more, that'll feel like a more interesting thing to do. It's beautiful though. It has a bit of that superbrothers style of sprite art. Oh. I like. Yeah. With a neon retro aesthetic. And so it looks really cool. And it is interesting. There are a few things about it that I'm already like, obviously, I don't know how much I'm going to enjoy this as I get further in. But there's stuff here at least that's interesting. So if you have game pass, it's on that. You can try it at least. Yeah, that game pass is, yeah, it's it's real good again. Games tried out for sure. Yeah, yeah. And I think it's worth trying if you like platformers. But I don't know if it's something I'm going to end up feeling good about. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, so that's Norena, boy. Nice. I did just struck me that I referenced it earlier. Yeah, I was. But did not actually explain. I wondered when we were going to get to this one. Yeah. So so Oddworld Soulstorm came out yesterday at the time we're recording, Tuesday, basically, this week. And I was quite pleased that I was doing a live stream yesterday and had a surprise and played a little clip of Oddworld Soulstorm. And it is of me in Oddworld Soulstorm. You, of you. Me. James Stephanie Sterling with an A. That's not what I was doing called, says. Fucking zoom. Always using the bloody government names. She's bastard. Yeah. So I am in it, which is big for me because I love that series. And they game this one's based on a zapped exodus. I think I was like 13 or something. I forget how old. But I got it on my birth. So I walked up to the Broadway backstreet, went and got it. Then me and my brother and a friend, we were basically attacked by a man who looked like Jake the snake Robert. He was having a go at us for something. We hadn't done anything. We were walking down an alley to go home and the accuses of something. And then I made some reference to, I basically sarcastically said we were going. And then he flipped his lid and we just ran to a nearby house and bashed on the door till he went away and they come out. It was very upset. The game's great though. So I very much enjoy Dave's exodus. That took the sting off being attacked by a man who looked like Jake the snake Robert. And this one, you know, a game that meant a lot to me. That basically those first two games are big definitive PlayStation experiences to me. That's the PSX. Instead of being in it, especially some of the used to like doing slig impressions and being like, oh, I would make a good slig voice. To be able to do one is really cool. I'll be it not the way I would have expected to do one. It's a sort of wartime broadcast device they wanted. And they seem to like it. People seem to enjoy it. So I think I did well. So yeah, that was exciting. And then they're fixing it. They did confirm they're fixing it. But yeah, in the credits, they did smell my name wrong. Sterling with a knife, which hasn't happened in such a long time. I don't know how people do it, but ain't it is getting fixed. And I said, if you go with James Stephanie Sterling, that'd be great. That'd be good. Does that be the first time I'm credited in a game with that name? Yeah, although I don't know where I'm in any voice acting gigs. I'll get my stocks declined rapidly in the game industry. I might be on games and voice in them. They won't be good games. They're the asset flips. Has anyone else played anything else this week? Or should we get a couple of news bits out the way quickly? Let's get some news bits. Let's just get those news. Ah, so this one, I'll go around through this quickly. This is Pokemon Go loot boxes update because oh, oh, I have I have opinion. They're not loot boxes. They're fun surprises, presents, surprises. I don't play this game anymore, other than logging in once a week to move my Pokemon off of the game and not play. Yeah. So Easter's coming up and there's part of their sort of spring Easter event. Pokemon Go is adding a special Pokemon, a flower variant of Happeney, which is the chancies on evolved little baby form. Yeah. Little flowers in it, Ted. You can only get it from eggs. Oh. It has, we don't know the exact hatch rate because that has not been announced, but we know from people like doing some fan estimation, it seems to have about a one percent hatch rate from eggs. Interesting. It is only available for four days. Oh. What a fun present. You have four days to get a thing that will hatch out of roughly one in a hundred eggs that require real world walking. Oh, it does. This is why I'm so like, this is why I have a good track record of being correct with the game industry. Because when there's an opportunity to be the worst, they'll always take it. You've just got to anticipate what is a shitty thing to do. And they will eventually succumb to the temptation. Now they are really incentivizing spending money on that fucker with random chance. Yeah. Well done. People who defended it. So doing some rough maths. These are two kilometer eggs, but during the Easter event, egg distances are going to be halved. So if you wanted to hatch one of these things completely for free, you'd have to walk approximately a hundred kilometers on foot in four days. However, that's not accurate because that's assuming that every egg that you've got in rotation was a two kilometer egg and that at no point did you accidentally have no two kilometer eggs and your collection was full. So you had to hatch an egg that wasn't two kilometer to open up the two kilometer egg. So like, at best, you're looking at a hundred kilometers of walking in four days. That's just for the regular variant. There is also a shiny variant of happening with flowers on its head. You have four days. If you wanted a shiny happening with flowers on its head in that four days before it's gone forever, estimate that you'd have to walk somewhere in the region of 3,000 kilometers in four days. Oh, screw you, Neantick. Oh my god. Yeah. Oh my god. One day they're going to take the absolute piss and they will literally have an egg you have to hatch by walking 500 miles and then 500 more. So yeah, even as obsessive as I am about wanting all of the shiny Pokemon, shiny happening with some flowers on its head. Fuck off. Not interested in you. Don't need you in my collection. I mean, yeah, that's just an absolute rotten pit. That is a rotten pitate. Yeah. I mean, I will go so far as to actually say Neantick are rotters and I have never called anyone arrived, never accused anyone of rotting them in my life. But they are all rotters. So that's a thing I just needed to get off my chest that that's happening. Well, here's the thing, right? They're not really learnt about things because No, they've just degraded them. You see, you see folks don't go to bat for them because they're not your friends and they will take that bat and they will fucking smash your face in with it. Yeah. They'll do that thing and untouchables is what they'll do. They'll untouchables your head with the bat you went to for them. Other things, this is just a nice little like, oh, free, free game to play soon that's happening. So you know, Nintendo has in the last year or two seemingly gotten really into, let's take a classic game and make it a battle royale that we give you as part of your online subscription. Oh sure. Be a Tetris 99, then there was Mario 99. We know what the next one of those is going to be. Disco 2000. Not quite. Oh. Ah, Pac-Man 99. Fuck here now. That's Pac-Man. That actually sounds interesting. Yeah, Pac-Man is about a royale. Is it like, everyone's a ghost and there's one Pac-Man? So my understanding is that everyone is playing an individual game of Pac-Man, but every time you eat a ghost, rather than it being like sent back to the center and then going back around your board, it gets sent to another players board. Yeah. I forgot that's how they do them. That's how they've done them all, right? It's basically like, yeah. Like a competitive puzzle game, like Poi-O-Poi-O, but levels. Yeah. Basically, you're trying to complete your single-player game, but you're trying to like, whenever you do something good, send that thing over to someone else that they've got more challenge to deal with. I hate them. Like, they're well-darned and clever concepts. Personally, I hate them. That's that. I've enjoyed both of them so far. I will definitely give this a go. It was announced with like, zero fanfare. It's just coming out today that when people listen to this episode. So if you've ever wanted to play Battle Royale Pac-Man, that's going to exist. Oh, God, I tell you what, no. I tell you what now, though. What? I want to play Pac-Man Championship Edition again now. Yeah. I want to play that other one. What was the glitch one, the one that's named after the, I think, the kill screen? 256. 256. Oh, I want to play 256. It's good. So it's funny you mentioned that. I think because this is coming out currently on the e-shop on the Switch, Pac-Man Championship Edition is like the most recent, like, the top-recommended thing. Oh, is it on sale? I didn't pay enough attention, but they put it front and center on the e-shop, at least in Europe. I don't think I've got it on Switch. Yeah. That'd be good, because I've got a train journey coming up at the end of the month. I don't know. I don't know if I've mentioned April 24. What is this about the poly-cold party, perhaps? There's a polyamco party. Going on April 24. It'll be streamed on Go Professional Wrestling on Twitch. So I'll be there with the championship belt rises. I'm not on the first non-Sys Possessor of it. I so, yeah. Come enjoy the pre-show an hour before and then we'll go to a radio. It's only got damn pre-show with awesome, so fun stuff. Exactly. In news that I'm sure is going to surprise everyone on this podcast, brace yourself. Are you both sitting down for this one? I am sitting. I'm, hang on, let me brace myself. I'm ready. Are you ready? I am. Okay. The link between loot boxes and problem gambling has been robustly verified. Supri- Kelsu- What? What? Loot boxes are basically gambling. Loot boxes are gambling, are they? And they've been linked to problem gambling, like addiction and overspending and... I'll read from the thing here. Researchers at the Universities of Clemith and Walter Hampton have said Oh! Loot boxes are structurally and psychologically akin to gambling. Oh! They also found that large numbers of children are opening loot boxes. Oh! It's almost like children are being hooked into gambling. Yeah, I tell you what, right? There was this um... Plucky, hopeful games pundit a couple years back. They think to have prospects at the time. Um, I can't remember their name. Yeah. Um, I think it was like, Jim Sterling with an eye or something. That's right. Yeah, it was about 2016. They were arguing that, you know, certain loot boxes that had been really popularized lately by overwatch and stuff. Like they'd been in some games, mobile games, be from that before then. Overwatch exploded and a whole bunch of people wanted to defend it because they liked Overwatch. And they told me I was making mountains out of mole hills. And it was just cosmetic. And I should drop it. I, I don't know, I don't know. Because according to the published report, which I've been sort of skimming over for the last few minutes, the first, you know, academic research into this is in 2017. So, obviously... You know, you couldn't have possibly just constructed this out of a general awareness of the mechanisms of, of capitalism and your lived experience. I'm not going to say that like, you know, a majority of the arguments against loot boxes was foundationally layered by myself. And, you know, a number of other people, like certainly there were people on my side. And viewers would sort of put that out there. But I, I chip for years over this stuff. Like I have several things where I've turned out to be right, where I've said something's going to happen. And as I've said before, I'm not saying this because I'm some like insightful wizard. Like I have just been doing this a long time. Yeah. I'm fucking out a long time. Yeah, there's more if this report will get into. Coincidentally, a lot of it is things we've talked a lot about on this book, often in other places. Yeah. So the report said that many games use a psychological nudge to encourage people to buy loot boxes, such as the fear of missing out on limited time items or special deals. Oh, that's surprising to me. I think there was a video done by someone who, you know, their stock had gone down a bit in, by that point, in that 2019. But they were still putting out, you know, some stuff with traction. And one of them, I think, was, God, it was something called like the addictive cost of predatory monetization or something like that. And it had interviews and statements from the people who had been explicitly targeted by these games. And it also included a lot of evidence of the attitudes within the game industry itself and the psychological tricks they deliberately employ. Yeah, look, here's the thing. Both in the media and in the industry and in the community. Ever since I started, I've been treated like I don't know what I'm talking about. And on several occasions, I've been completely correct. And then when it becomes on-vogue to say the things I've been saying, I'm completely erased from the conversation. And to fuck everyone who penned for years these rebuttals and are now, you know, suddenly pretending they didn't. Look, I'm an expert on this. I'll fucking say that. I've done this long enough. I have sinned this behavior. I have, I've done the fucking research and I spoke to the people. Yeah, I'm not saying I should be fucking front and center everywhere. But not one person ever reached out about the research I did. Come on. I know you're not alone in this as well. A few weeks back, some blue-head video making personally internet that might have been called Laura. Did a video again on this very similar topic talking about, you know, how all these things affect people with disabilities, specifically psychological nudges like the fear of missing out? Well, we talked about it in the IDHD episode as well, because I've been caught, like, imagine that as staunchly against loot boxes and shit as I am. I once idly put some money into that fucking pocket mournies because my brain was just not focusing, right? Yeah. It's fucking scary. The dedicated video I did on this a couple of weeks ago where I was like, here is just laying out every disability that is impacted by these tricks and how it impacts them and how these groups are targeted. I had people literal weeks ago trying to tear down, like, oh no, no, you've been hyperbolic by saying that it's manipulative gambling, you know, praying on people who are susceptible to FOMO. I think it's outrageous. And I'll say it, that I have this reputation of repeating myself a lot, not because it's untrue. It is. But that is never applied to the people I have constantly had to push back against, who have been parroting the same corporate apology and propaganda for years without changing their tune. And every time I say, right, here are the reasons that that argument is wrong. And it's ignored every single time until things like this happen. Just like when I said, regulation would come for them. And no one listened. And I said, they're gambling and no one listened. And I got all of this just cosmetic shit. And all of this, it just skips the grind and it's optional. And fuck all of that. So there's more in this study. I'm going to summarize some things. I'll work as a stablish that engagement with loot boxes is associated with problem gambling behaviors, with players encouraged to purchase through psychological techniques, such as fear of missing out. We've also demonstrated that at risk individuals, such as problem gamblers, gamers, young people, and disabled people make disproportionate contributions to loot box revenues. I'm shocked. Yeah, shocking, terrifying, who could have seen it coming? I mean, God, if only, if only video games, if only the discourse with a capital day had some sort of Cassandra figure, I tell you what, it's almost a shame that Stephanie was the name I always knew I'd go with because Cassandra would be so fucking out. Ha, ha, ha, ha. Christ, look, I'm sorry if I sound overly bitter on this, but I've had multiple instances recently as well of just like being erased from certain things or having certain things like accomplishments just ignored or actively scrubbed out in some areas. And I fucking add enough, I'm the first to open the Quittite Alhaltor in the Zibian Alabama. I'm the champion region, I'm the commander, I don't have to deal with this shit, years being portrayed as someone who just rants aimlessly and loses their temper a lot. Bollocks! There's one other bit of loot box news, just while we're on it. Brazilian authorities are investigating loot boxes with an idea to potentially ban them altogether. Oh, God. Another country on the list that's going, hey, hey, what if we got rid of them entirely? Well, FIFA, I mean. Yeah, yeah. And that's huge. Yeah. It's a huge market for FIFA. Yes, yeah. So the inquiry comes in response to a recommendation by the National Association of Child and Adolescent Defense Centers, which is by several lawsuits against game companies over their use of loot boxes, arguing that their harmful form of gambling a banned activity in Brazil. Yeah, it's about time. Yeah, I hope. Because, you know, we're talking about big multi-billion dollar corporations here. There's a lot they can weasel out of. But if this goes through and they can't put their gambling aimed at kids in FIFA in Brazil, good. Yeah. What a fucking reckoning. And so deserved because they either knew this was coming and was just trying to dip in as much as they can until it all collapsed. Or they truly thought they'd get away with this imperturity. Despite the warnings, despite the obvious, the obvious direction this was going to go in. You can't destroy that many families bank accounts. And you can't make billions and billions of dollars without politicians getting very curious. The utter once-and-short sighted average single-minded grade got them here and I hope it burns them. I hope it burns them inside out. Agreed. Come, Radney. Jeff Bezos owes me a million pounds. And the additions to this. No, I mean, I think that pretty much sums it up. I think we've all known that regulation of this was going to be inevitable. Yeah. Europe has looked at it. Various countries in Europe have sort of flirted with that. And now, you know, we're seeing Brazil doing it. And, you know, I think it is telling that because I do think that this is 100% because of FIFA, which is one of the worst offenders in this respect. Oh, sure. And one of the most child-focused ones as well. Well, it's rated for kids age three and up. Yeah. Yeah. So, you know, it remains to be seen, whether or not Brazil does this. And I mean, I don't have a tremendous amount of confidence in the Brazilian government. It is another government now that is at least examining it. And the more governments that do examine this process, the more it's going to spark interest from other countries that are going to start to look at this and be like, oh, wait a minute, we do have a problem here. So, I think it is across the board, good news. Whether it moves the needle a lot or a little, hard to say, but it's certainly something positive to end the show on. Yeah, the vindication is fucking that. Like, I mean, it was there. It's been there for years. Sure. Like, this, as far as I'm concerned, like, I didn't even pay much attention to the story at first because I was like, oh, it's been proven again, has it? Yeah. Like, this isn't the first study even. There's been many study after study. So, I saw it as just another one. And then suddenly, everyone was shocked. All right. I think this study has something like 17 other studies that it drew upon to compile its research. Once I saw, like, how big it was. I was like, ah, but I'm just so used to being proven right on this issue. I'm so used to everything I've said would come to pass, coming to pass, that was like, ah, yes, more evident. Good. And then I was like, ah, lots of evidence. And I can hear in the distance, Hark, tunes a change in fucking hell. Oh, that's this week. Yeah, I think that's enough for one week. That's enough. I think we done did this week. Well, I say it's enough. Some people just can't get enough. They just can't get enough. They just can't get enough. No, it's certainly not of content. And I've been told that you can't stop till you get enough. And I've heard the ones you pop you can't stop. In the name of love, Laura, what stuff have you got? You can find me at Laura Gay Buzz all around the internet, Twitter, Twitch, YouTube, Patreon. That's the one that pays the bills. You find me on TikTok. I do little videos there every now and then. I've been enjoying doing those. You can find me on Twitch Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, 10 PM UK, 5 PM Eastern, 2 PM Pacific. Every Friday on YouTube, I upload episodes of Accessibility. This week's episode is about the Switch's specific accessibility control that and why you're probably better off just buying the Xbox One and sort of jerry rigging it into your Switch. Other than that, I do subtitles every week for the gym position, which are usually up within about an hour and a half of the episode being live. Amazingly quick. You do not need to apologize for it being late. You are amazingly quick. I will still apologise every week and you know it. So there's that. I've got books, uncomfortable labels. That's out now. Things I learned from Mario's, but that's out now. Gender euphoria, that comes out on June 10th. That's coming up. Less than, that's like two months away now. That's super soon. Backers should be getting their copies real soon. I bought a big batch of pens ready for doing signings again soon, so that'll be exciting. Other than that, Pixel Square. It's a podcast about video game porn. Queer and pleasant strangers where I talk about the things that aren't video games that I do in the week. And dice fun. It's a Dungeons & Dragons podcast. Every season is its own little story, so you can jump into any season. I'm on seasons three, four, five, six, seven and currently season eight, which has just been going on a couple of weeks. Konrad, you were on that show too, right? I was on that show and you can also find me on Twitter at Konrad Zimmerman. And you can hang out with me on Twitch, Mondays, Tuesdays, Fridays and Sundays. I know it's a weird-ass schedule, but I like to run the gamut. That's at twitch.tv slash that Konrad Zimmerman had a really good stream on Monday. There's a Vada on the channel with Dame or Sophie about how the Matrix sequels are a lot better than you remember, which is something that I've always thought those movies were actually pretty good. Listen, if you've missed conversations between Konrad and Dame or Sophie, you've missed out highly recommended content. When they get together, it's great discussion. They are a lot of fun to have on, always do enjoy it. So that's at twitch.tv slash that Konrad Zimmerman. I'm also on some podcasts. I do a podcast called Let's Talk About Snacks with Lauren Morgan and Linda Camiolo, where I talk about snacks. All sorts of snacks. It's a good show. It's fun. It's light. It's breezy. It's usually less than an hour, something you can just pop on and enjoy real quick. And something that's less enjoyable, perhaps, is Boston's favorite son, which I think we might be able to do an episode of that this week. That'd be good. The thing is cross. That would be nice. Yeah, that would be good, but everything I do online is supported on Patreon. Patreon.com slash fist shark. So you can maybe chip in a few bucks and have that. Hey, you know what else has a Patreon? Oh, James Stephanie Sterling. James Stephanie Sterling. Hi, it's me. Yeah, patreon.com slash gym acquisition. If you want to kick some cash start. Why, thank you so much recently, by the way. The support's been fantastic. It's nice to have in reserve, just in case things have to progress with certain developers. Nothing to report there, by the way, you know, the work continues. And also, you know, it funds the show, gets me to pay people, supports my boggling habit. It's all good. The new Kickstarter bogglings came in. They're real good. And that's it. Thank you so much for the support. Don't forget, Polyam Cult Party 3, April 24th, 3pm Eastern. And that'll be on Twitch TV, Go Professional Wrestling. And there will be a pre-show and aal before, with Conrad and Laura. That's it. Thank you so much. Glaze me in your hot sausage glue.",

Mike Beppie, welcome to the podcast. It's great to be here Josh. This is finally the episode where we reveal that all of my takes, all of my opinions that I express on the podcast are just recycled ideas from Mike Beppie and Daniel Keller in 2012. I have been familiar with your work for many, many years. We go back quite a ways, I guess. Yeah, that's very generous. I wouldn't quite put it that way, but yeah, we go way back and I think, like I said, this is going to be an interesting conversation just because so much of what I think the book is about is being kind of co-evolving with a lot of your work. So excited to chat about this. Yeah, for the maybe minority of my listeners who are not familiar with your writing, you have been published in Spike magazine, Freeze magazine, Art in America, the Paris review, E-Flux, Ryzom, the new inquiry, Art Forum, Modern Painters, the Art newspaper, the Brooklyn Rail, I just I stopped writing down magazines after that point. You've also contributed to do not research, maybe the most prestigious among that bunch. Absolutely. You were importantly the editor of the data issue from Dis magazine. This was a very formative piece. I believe I was back in 2014, if I'm correct. Yep. 2014. Yeah, including Trevor Paglin, Simon Denney, Astrotailer, Matt Dryhurst and Benjamin Bratton, whose work I'm sure we'll discuss a little bit later in the podcast. And then of course, you were the editor of an issue from SFMOMA, Open Spaces, issue eight, called Heavy Machinery, that included Anna Cachean, Anishka Karant, Yena Soutella, a number of other people. You have the introductory essay for that piece as well. And most recently, you're the author of a new book called Against Platforms, Surviving Digital Utopia. Somehow, I don't know how this happened, but people in the discord have the physical book and I'm still reading from the PDF. Do you care to explain yourself on that? Yeah, one of the interesting things about writing this book is you get to realize how publishing works and how the sausages made. Yeah, apparently, Galleys are out, like warehouse printed copies are out. I respect the hustle. Someone must have just emailed the publisher and said they want a copy. Well, they seem to be enjoying it. Do you want to tell us just to kind of start off here? Tell us a little bit about this book, the kind of summary of your work, and maybe the last like 10, almost 15 years now, I would say? Definitely somewhat of a personal take. I wouldn't quite call it a memoir, but I do insert myself a lot. It's not an academic text by any means. It's really cultural criticism. Very much on par with what I've been writing for the last 15 or 20 years, sort of being immersed in our micro generation, which, you know, a recurring theme in the book is we kind of all, in various cultural pursuits, in various different institutions in our jobs. We've kind of seen this roughly 20-year period where you essentially have platforms taking over different functions, different parts of everyday life. But really what it is is a reflection on that process and, you know, sort of how this happened. I think the main thrust of the book is it really focuses on the ideology underlying all this, the ideology of digital utopia. It's essentially just 10 core kind of counter arguments that I hope demystify digital utopianism and the kind of the situation we're in that with platforms. If you had gone to art school you studied the humanities and some capacity. The emergent phenomena that we were looking into at this time, like beginning around, I guess, 2011, there was not academy expertise about any of these topics because they were happening in real time, basically. The lineage that I always reference back to, you had mentioned techno utopianism before, you had famously run this reading group called Cloud-based Institutional Critique, at which I first encountered the work of David Harvey in a class taught by Amber Ely Frost. And this is part of a lineage of basically peer-organized reading groups that took place over the course of 10 years in New York City, straddling the ghetto, the intersection of art and tech, which were at the time like two very unpopular topics. And when you jam them together they're even more nerdy and weird. And these things grew to be really, really influential in the years following. So I would say that formative to my education outside of the academy proper was chat room, which was a reading group run by Brad Trumel at the Bruce I.Quality Foundation University. Following that, Mike, you ran Cloud-based Institutional Critique. And then I organized an impoverished attempt to revitalize this process where we read actually topical to the last few weeks the Unibomber Manifesto, I think, in the first class. And the title of that was called Will This Be Live Streamed. I kind of think of these like artist-organized intellectual discussions for lack of a better term. This was feeling a gap where existing academies and institutions didn't have like the language, terminology, resources, or interest, to be honest, to talk about any of these things. And I just so turned out that they were incredibly important. And now, you know, God forbid Elon Musk is like basically the government is what it seems like this week. I see this book as a distillation of your work over that like 10-year process of kind of refining this critique at the level of ideology, really looking at this kind of philosophical level, this very, very kind of macro view. To start off and kind of like lay the foundation, I think there's a lot of young people who listen to this podcast, you know, they're familiar with critiques of platforms and critiques of technology. But it wasn't like that in 2011. Like the same stuff that we're saying now, you know, we've been saying this for like 12 years and it was so unpopular. It was so unpopular back then. So what was it like talking about, especially among educated, progressive people when you would bring up topics like Uber and Airbnb back in 2011? How did people think of those platforms like what was their response to these ideas? Yeah, I mean, there's a ton to say on this. I think you're absolutely correct in situating the kind of bedrockier. So a lot of institutions were flat-footed. The mainstream media was flat-footed when sort of Silicon Valley and the kind of platforms you mentioned, all the new devices you mentioned had kind of been putting forth this narrative. They were going to be liberatory. They were going to democratize X, Y and Z. And yeah, it was really wild because at the time I was working in tech deep inside, talking to these folks every day, working with these folks every day, obviously reading, you know, at that time, kind of these like almost ideological rags, like tech crunch and things like that. Then you go and talk to, you know, then I'd go and talk to folks who were maybe of a slightly more leftist or liberal persuasion. If you folks in the art world, folks who are, you know, on the more creative side of things. And you kind of hear it, you know, you wouldn't hear any criticality around some of these narratives. You would sort of just kind of hear the same kind of championing. So there were so many instances where these institutions kind of allowed this to happen. Or they essentially did not really put up any kind of critical fight. Now there were a ton of amazing voices, but they were sort of felt like they were sort of underground. Or they were almost kind of like they were sort of outside the mainstream, particularly in this period. So it took a while for people to kind of realize that the narrative that the platforms were putting out, the narrative that was coming out of Silicon Valley, you know, was essentially something that could be resisted as a part of the left. I mean, even today there are folks who still think that digital innovation or a new startup or a computing paradigm will kind of rescue us. I think what I talk about in the book is actually that mistake and assumption. But I don't quite think that, you know, we should be loved at and we should turn back on technology, right? So I think basically you had this kind of, you've used a term, the long march through institutions. Right. That was a process that after the tech lash has become it's now the over two minutes shifted where people are saying, yes, this actually was a kind of power grab. But I think what we should do next is still a topic of hot debate. Yeah, I guess the big hazard kind of ethical, philosophical hazard here is that if you're making a critique of technology, I mean, this was the entire point of politogram in the post left, the essay that kind of started this whole project. It's very easy to retreat into this anti tech anarcho primitivist, let it position, which just says like smash all the machines. And I think that both of us felt that that was intellectually and philosophically insufficient, but also impractical. If there is some type of catastrophic collapse, the billionaires, the Peter Teals of the world have a much more well-resourced bunkers than you and I would be able to put together. And so what is kind of required is to put forward what I would describe as being a tech socialist platform. There needs to be a kind of positive proposal. As we ease our way into this, maybe let's just try and define some of these terms because I think they're they can be a little bit slippery. What is a platform? Like what do we practically speaking? What do we mean when we call something a platform? What are the distinguishing features of that? Yeah, so I basically spend most of the book trying to tease this out, right? Because I don't think the platform has a good kind of sound-by-definition. The platform really is a kind of organizational form and logic that can transcend multiple different things. But for simplicity's sake, if I'm explaining this to my uncle, I would say, we're looking at private for-profit companies that are digital first. And they don't always have to be sort of two-sided marketplaces, but that is generally how they work. Some sort of software layer in between users who are either producing things for the platform or consuming things from the platform. And then you have sort of what you might call buyers or sellers or people on the other side of this equation. The standard one, which probably will go down in history as platform form, par excellence is Uber, right? You need to ride, you need to cab. There was this series of legal and social institutions around hailing a cab, how to get a cab, the idea of the car, all this around getting from point A to point B. Uber basically comes around and says, we are going to have a two-sided marketplace that allows us to get you a cab quicker. Initially it was cheaper, but we all know what that strategy was about. It was a lot cheaper. Not anymore. People forget that. It was cheaper than taking a yellow cab at the beginning. That's why a lot of people did it. And that's just one of a hundred different ways, which we kind of get into in the book of how it kind of took over. But basically something like Uber is a platform. Now, the philosophy behind Uber and the organizing logic behind Uber can take on multiple different formats. But this became the most attractive format for a number of types of industries, slash organizations. I think everyone can think of something like this that they use that in some way at one point promise to make things easier, make things quicker. But yeah, that would be my quick working definition of the platform. Yeah, I mean, the kind of sloppy version that I'll throw around sometimes is a platform is the digital space in which buyers and sellers meet. The platform takes the data. Right? So they have their goods. Someone is selling. Someone is buying. But then the platform owns the space. And then they also extract this other layer of information on top of it. Yeah. And you write in the book about this being neoliberal by design. What are these philosophical throughpoints that you see with, you know, and I think you're referencing at this point, like old school neoliberalism, like 1947 neoliberalism. Not like the not the 80s like Reagan Thatcher stuff, but like that deep kind of philosophical origin that comes from Meas' and Hayek and all of these guys. How are these platforms neoliberal by design? Yeah, this brings up a really interesting topic, which is I don't want to say that platforms themselves have a specific ideology that they enact. Like, you might say there's an organization is X ideology, lust they export it. What I'm more talking about is the way that we arrived here over an arc that does go back as far as you referenced, a kind of slow erosion of institutions, kind of slow erosion of not just nation states, which is like classical neoliberalism, but also I would say the idea that there is any kind of beachhead that would stop, you know, the full optimization of everyday life. Now, you know, classical neoliberalism deals with economics, but as we know, it kind of moves into social life, it moves into the way we consider the individual, the way we consider the self. So when I say that they were designed in that way, I more mean what led up to them. I'm very adamant, I think, in the book in multiple spots, to say that platforms and the ideology of platforms is a kind of non-politics. It's a kind of anti-politics, right? The true, perfect platform will never take a political stance, because that would mean that they cannot be the invisible arbiter and the invisible sort of monopolizing software that kind of allows folks to keep on uploading, right? So it's not in the platforms design to ever be that judge. And so I do think there's lots of ways that I think folks can kind of see where those dots connect there. There is an important moment in which the taxi cabs in New York are refusing to pick up people from JFK. In the context of your analysis and your book, this is kind of a pivotal moment that encapsulates a lot of these struggles. Delete Uber. Delete Uber. Yeah. Would you mind for people who don't remember that period? This is an incredibly important example. Yeah, I think this is a flash point. Basically, the situation was after the so-called Muslim ban from Trump's first administration, there was pretty standard union action among taxi drivers. They said the best way for us to use our economic leverage is to basically just not do any pickups as a kind of like a wildcat strike situation. At the moment, it was interesting because you clearly had folks on the left with this kind of millennial left that the last thing they want to do is have to wait anywhere and we're around even though they see themselves as members of the avant-garde proletariat. It was a interesting moment where people started to read and of course what happened was basically Uber swept in. In an almost poetic kind of illustration of the platform excels where the institution crumbles, you had Uber have a banner day and you had Uber picking up all these folks. What happened was the strength of the strike was essentially defeated by the platform of Uber. Now, how did that happen? It happened because people on Uber not only are they not part of this union, they're not part of this taxi cab union, they're not even employees. So they're entrepreneurs. They think of themselves as their own boss. So what it kind of illustrated was that the strike wasn't broken by scabs, it was broken by design by a platform where every single driver was an entrepreneur unto themselves. That's what we mean when we say neo-liberal by design. Yeah, literally in the design they are not employees, they're entrepreneurs. Right, I mean there's no better free flow of capital when every single person feels like they themselves are the capitalist, right? So I think that's exactly it. And so what happened was it was a very political decision to do this and I think it was a time when most people kind of woke up finally and realized like these happy, fun, probably culturally liberal platforms, they're created to kind of remove any of this kind of direct action or any of this kind of consciousness around these issues. So you know, it's suddenly and by the way, we haven't even mentioned how a lot of Trump's presidency was also built on exploding a platform, right? Exploding, exploding social media. In a way that I think the Democrats were potentially flat footed for, Trump was likely to go direct to consumer and around institutions and use different platforms to kind of get his message, message out. So delete Uber and the taxi cab workers strike. It wasn't quite the beginning of the tech lash, but it was potentially one of the more interesting events to come out of the tech lash. Yeah, maybe important to flag early on. We were both very much inspired by Benjamin Braden's book, The Stack. We're watching the emergence of these 21st century structures that are analogous to states in that there's something happening now that is similar to the transformation from feudalism to capitalism where we went from organizing human society from kingdoms into states as we would understand them in that period back to you. I think 1648 to the Treaty of West Fahlia or you know, there's like trade dispute between the Dutch and the Germans in which we had to define literally like lines on a map of where certain territories begin and other territories end. Right. And that idea has been basically uninterrupted for you know, what 400 years or some odd amount of history. And we are now watching this additional layer of organizing human society being scaffolded on top of the existing states, taking these platforms seriously as young artists who are like talking about Instagram, talking about Facebook, basically stuff that was aggregating images at that time. Once we started to realize that there's like a much larger political question happening here, the conversations then became like really explicitly political rather than just aesthetic. So tagging that early on, that's a very important thing that'll come up a bit later. I'm sure. But as we define some of these terms, what is an institution, right? Like if there's, if as hard as it is to define a platform, like it's even harder to define an institution. So do you have like a convenient pocket definition for what an institution is? Yeah, yeah, I really really set up a lot of work for myself in this book. So, so first of all, I just wanted to make a note before about like kind of the what led to all this. I mean, one of the problems was the left has been anti-institutional from, I think, you know, from yes. Let's call it the postmodern left or like the the left has always been sort of afraid to take power. They've always been very skeptical of power. They've been skeptical of institutions. I think most of the silicon that I mean, this is why all this stuff is so it's so different. You're right to identify the terms here because all of this stuff is kind of mixed together in a bowl at the end of the day, right? So there's no like perfect flag bearing people in any of these things. But I still think it's important to talk about this stuff. You know, institutions are both little institutions and big-eye institutions, right? So when I think about journalism, I think of journalism as essentially a broad institution that, you know, has many specific institutions that sort of enact that service, that good. Institutions are unlike platforms in that they take a position and they essentially create an institute literally. They literally produce something for its own good. They believe in the end product. Another way to think about it is, you know, I think we think of there are certain things in public life, in political life that are institutionalized for good reason. So, you know, the national health service, there are certain things around. We don't think that the free market should come in and be sort of adjudicating this, right? So I sort of think that one of the ways that we best define the institution is by seeing essentially what the platform took as its target, right? Because my thesis in the book is essentially the organizing principles of the platform are the antithesis of what we had come to know and come to rely on as institutions. And I think the situation we're in today is very much a process of that kind of change or that kind of change in how we've now entrust to platforms, what used to sort of be part of our fabric of political life in institutions. Yeah, if you're someone who went to art school or it doesn't have to be specifically art school, it could just be studying the humanities in any capacity. You were probably acculturated to these ideas that like the progressive urgent task ahead of you is to overthrow the corrupt institutions. Exactly. Just do Foucault to everything, basically. And I really feel like that is a product referencing Braden again here of Boomer Theory, like literally Boomer professors that grew up in the like 68 counterculture. And it's just we're in a fundamentally different environment right now that people were not equipped with the rhetorical tools to actually describe the process that was happening. And so you got this weird, these weird moments where progressives ended up functioning like the foot soldiers of these crazy libertarian projects, right? Because they were so hesitant to defend even the, you know, institutional structure as an abstraction, right? And the void that is necessarily filled by that is this competitive dynamic forces of markets and so on. So I think, you know, my pocket definition for institutions is like this is a place in which decisions are deliberated around a table, but there is no presence of market forces. What that institution does is not determined by prices and competition. Exactly. We are here to do this. And so we will allocate our resources based on that. And you don't justify it based on return on investment or however many copies of the magazine you're going to sell. You're like, this is important. We're going to publish it. And that's just a fundamentally different way of producing culture when it comes to platforms, which are entirely based on the on the consumption side. So in kind of reference to that period, the 2012 moment or 2011 when we were talking about these things, there was kind of a misconception of the critiques that we were making of being somehow like a crypto conservative critique. I'm sure you remember this that getting a lot of flack for these ideas at that time. So yeah, being an institutionalist was kind of understood as being a conservative. I think misunderstood, but that's how it was interpreted at the time. And the argument that we would make from this is that like we're not taking lineage or inspiration or we're not taking theoretical inspiration from the new left of the 1960s. We are taking inspiration from the old left of the 1920s. Like the environment we live in now is so much more akin to the labor capital dynamic of a hundred years ago than it was 50 years ago that we just need to go back to a theoretical kind of class first analysis to be able to understand the dynamics that are taking place now. But in the context of culture, in the context of culture, which is our background for this, you write in the book about gatekeeping. And there's been a lot of talk about this online institutions notoriously are gatekeepers of culture. And that may or may not be a bad thing. What do you think is wrong with this approach, this criticism of gatekeepers? Yeah, oh wow, what do I start? So what I'd say about this is it's funny. You kind of coiled together a definition of what we mean by the institution or what I should say what is worth saving about that idea and what is worth recuperating about that idea when you narrow in on maybe what I'd argue is a core function of what institutions do. And that is gatekeeping, as you said, sticking with the world of culture, I think that like it did in every other kind of arena, the platform came in or Silicon Valley came in and said everyone is an artist, everyone can access an audience. No one is no a central authority will control or manipulate what you see, you know, what you hear, what is important and you are all entrepreneurs, you are essentially all now artists. I think of like Chris Anderson's long tail as being like a seminal essay in this regard. That was celebrated. And I think we both remember, you know, it was very hard not to get whipped up in that enthusiasm. I think what happened over the last like 10 or 15 years, which I talk about in this book is we sort of kind of realized what we gave up with that. And look, there was never a rosy future where every artist could eat or every creator was, there always is essentially like a curve there of struggle and a lack of opportunity. But I can tell you this, the platform only for an even smaller elite and even smaller group of folks really made any sense, right? So I think with gatekeeping, it's like there's always a mix, right? You we may have opened the gates, but I think what we let in is another topic for debate. You know, what is the function? What is the function of there being some sort of central arbiter, some sort of central? And this is where I would use the term institution again. Like that is another way to back into the definition of institution. It's something that is not agnostic to the content. It takes a position. It might be a little bit harder to join. But once once you join, once it creates a world, it kind of creates this life blood. It kind of creates this sort of sustaining function that only up until now, we now realize that, hey, maybe, you know, maybe the institution wasn't this, you know, big bad thing. Potentially there were some redeeming qualities here. And maybe this is how we can kind of visualize what the platform did. And so when we say institution, it's almost impossible, even when I say it every single time, not to have this kind of negative connotation. But what I think we're trying to work towards here is, you know, how does technology fit into these? How do we, how do we keep working and living in a future that, you know, will not be buddha? How do we keep creating and using these tools? But how would we reorganize them such that we have all of the productive qualities of software and new media, but they're sort of reorganized and rehoused. And what I think, what I think our generation is kind of coming to is like that probably actually means a mix of rehabilitating some of the functions of institutions. And I think gatekeeping is one. I mean, even the metaphor gatekeeping just obviously sets you up for a negative kind of experience. It's particularly when it comes to culture, right? Like, like, you know, and I think I think the other interesting about get think about gatekeeping is it sort of it sort of implies scarcity or that scarcity is an important part of what makes art good. Absolutely not. You know, I think of like when you think of, oh, are you going to get a solo show at the Whitney? Like only like four or five people get that a year or whatever it is. Well, maybe there should just be like 500 Whitney's, right? You know, like, maybe there should be like why are there just more? It's like, so I think what we're trying to do here is say, you know, gatekeeping, let's rehabilitate the idea of gatekeeping and let's maybe think of a new term for that. How did this cozy like state embrace of tech as a solution to, you know, bigger political problems begin? Where does that relationship start to intertwine? Probably I would point to the history of sort of the new Democrats. It has to do with this kind of third way Democrat, right? Folks like Bill Clinton, it was kind of a moment where the new Democratic elite left the kind of working class and moved on to the kind of essentially like laptop email job, this kind of what folks have called the professional managerial class. For me, that was a pretty important development, you know, someone argued that Obama became the kind of symbol for that. Obama famously was elected, not necessarily on any kind of left wing economic vision that he would ever enact. But more about this idea, obviously, I think I think I think I didn't be politics played a large role, but for me, it's basically around this idea that the elites at this point had been captured by libertarian light pro innovation ideology that we would see, you know, enacted a lot more directly after kind of Silicon Valley kind of really, really came around. I mean, I think it's funny because Obama was one of the first candidates to kind of embrace a direct consumer, get out the vote online on platforms. If you remember, like Obama was celebrated in the press for very effectively targeting voters and getting the message out. Right. And you know, what, like eight years later, when some other platform does it for in a different direction, it's like, oh, this is a bad thing. It's like, well, y'all just said it was good before. Do you not like it or what's going on here? So maybe why you and I didn't get so upset or worried about things like Cambridge Analytica, which is now thoroughly at this point been disproven and was not effective enough to sway anyone's opinion. But yeah, there's just, I mean, many layers of hypocrisy that start to get a little bit confusing here. But I mean, I always go back to this one staggering statistic that of anyone outside of elected office in government, Obama met most frequently with Google. Some representative from Google like once a week for eight years, basically, he met with them. I mean, more than most people who are in government, but above and beyond anyone else in the private sector, very parallel interests between ways of organizing human society between the state and Google in the Obama era. Yeah, I think that there's multiple ways in which current platforms act like states or slash require a state to operate. But I think in the case of Obama and Trump, it's like, I think it's hard to kind of deal in absolutes here, because in one case, you have sort of Silicon Valley ideology like platforms wanting to use government to institute their policies. And they see government as sort of just sort of another kind of institution to kind of infiltrate and remake. Right. So when you look at Doge right now, it's so interesting because it's this perfect contradiction, right? They essentially think that AI can come in and do all of these parts of government. They are essentially infiltrating government to in this kind of small government libertarian mindset. But really, they just believe that these things shouldn't even exist. They just sort of are using them to kind of help out their own economic interests. Someone like Elon Musk understands that the government is important to his companies, right? The other contradiction here is that a lot of these platforms, the internet itself, began with government support, right? So everything kind of gets mixed together here. And that's why we're kind of in this in this moment. When Elon Musk looks at Doge, he looks at it as an opportunity to act like Silicon Valley can come in and do this better. But at the same time, he also secretly, what he's not telling folks, is that he realizes that they pay the paper, right? They're the ones who actually will enact the laws and his platforms, his several companies will stand to benefit from him meddling in in this. So that's why it's such a funny contradiction that they're sort of anti-state and want to say that they can do a better job, but that they know they rely on it deeply kind of in the new term. This is always the fundamental core, the antagonism of neoliberalism as an ideology is that it is pushing these kind of strident libertarian free market principles that issues the public sector that we don't need the state to all of this kind of stuff. And then at the same time, they are always reliant on the existence of the state. Quincylibodian has a great way of phrasing this, which is that contrary to classical liberalism, the neoliberals did not believe that the market would just naturally arise on its own. It has to be ceded by the state. There are institutions that underpan the existence of these markets. And so the goal of neoliberalism, as it was refined over the 20th century, was to enshrine institutions into everyday life that would uphold market forces. And they would become nearly invisible to the extent that you don't even notice their existence, but they would create either through law or through practically speaking code in the design of platforms. They would create the infrastructure for this entrepreneurial marketplace. And that is, I mean, just a direct one-to-one analog for what a platform is. Exactly. It is the theoretical instantiation of neoliberalism as determined through software. I do think a lot of this comes down to not as much a sort of personal ideology that one can have political and more just around how much it's an outgrowth of the essentially formation and the industry of venture capital. The reason why we have platforms and the reason why they look like, I mean, I say in the book, there's a communist digital platform. You could do that, but I actually end up arguing against that, I think, in the book. But the quest for constant growth for its own sake is potentially the biggest export of venture capitalism, the de-risking everything, the idea that any kind of cost or risk associated with any activity should be removed. That, for me, is if I had to figure out the main avatar here, it would be sort of the venture capitalist idea. That is there. So when you think of like, when you think of all the folks involved in Silicon Valley, they're multiple different players in this game. You have really the avatar of the venture capitalist typified by Mark Andreson. And I think where Andreson goes, interestingly, where he doesn't really have to, what he sort of loves to kind of talk is he's quite open about his kind of like right-wing libertarianness in a way that he doesn't need to be. I think it's, which is why he's so interesting and he loves to write, too. So when he is in case anyone doesn't recognize, this is the author of the techno-optimist manifesto, the guy who literally cites the meme accounts in his, he's also in charge of tremendous amounts of billions of dollars of venture capital. So very influential person. Right, but I think, and I think there's several manifestos he's written, he wrote wondering, COVID, about time to build, time to build explicitly talks about how institutions failed us. And it's up to essentially this hero type force that he describes. In the techno-optimist manifesto, this hero force is literally the word technology, the idea of technology. You know, if I think a big problem to go back to like what this avatar might be for someone like that, it's this blind belief in computation for computation's sake or technology as not a historically contingent force, but technology as somehow standing outside of history and constantly being this force for progressive good. I mean, I think that for me is the biggest single export out of Silicon Valley, less of like, oh yeah, they're all libertarians or less of like, oh they're all, you know, this or that. Yeah, in the book actually, you described Stuart Brand as the chief theologian of the Silicon Valley ideology. Would you explain to people just a little bit of the background of who is Stuart Brand? What is the whole earth catalog? Like, where do these ideas come from? How do they become so influential in tech? It's a very famous book, Fred Turner is from cyber culture to counter culture. It's how we moved from kind of the hippie counter culture, West Coast anti-authoritarianism, how that moved through a group organized around, loosely around, Stuart Brand and the whole earth catalog, you know, that kind of led us to the Silicon Valley we have today. It's a long book. There's a lot of different folks in there. But to do sit down or to reduce it down, it's in this idea of the tool as an inherently liberatory kind of object. It's this idea that computing would free us from the shackles of the Cold War institutions and specifically the government, right? In that sense, it's pretty squarely libertarian. But the odd contradiction here is that so much of this was actually being kind of run through government funding or large universities. And I think what you get from counter culture to cyber culture is this sort of pseudo religion that ends up kind of influencing a lot of the web 2.0 Silicon Valley founders. It's this idea that what they're doing is a force for good, you know, liberation from the man, quite simply. We later found out as sort of like historical irony here is that all of these type of potentially well-meaning true hippie counter culture libertarian things ended up becoming co-opted by the by the man quote unquote. Right. It's a dramatic transformation from the kind of utopian aspirations of those projects that we may have thought of being some part of the left in the 60s and 70s and then became seamlessly integrated into the neoliberal rights of the 90s, a complete transformation. In the book, you've got 10 core points. I was thinking maybe in a bit of a summary, we could just go through some of these points and I'll give some commentary on it. You can jump in as well. But if you're in do not research, you've probably read the original version of this essay. This is a kind of more refined list, but then expanded on in the chapter structure of the book itself. My favorite of these points, and this is something that you and I have gotten in the weeds about many, many years at this point, but you write technology can never occupy a space outside of capitalism. With rare exceptions, every application, company, or innovation will have a funding source, a board, or a bottom line. And in all cases, the logic of capitalism will eventually super seed and control technical tools. What we identify as technology in quotes technology is just capitalism but faster and worse. Yeah, this one is controversial. I think in the course of writing this book, I obviously dealt with a lot of folks who have brought the counter argument here, right? Like the blockchain socialist whose book is quite good. Yeah, he's a smart guy. Yeah, I went on his podcast. He's very serious about the co-op stuff. Yeah, even Richard Wolfe, famous Marxist professor, has said some very positive things about the ability to build cooperative structures and so on. Right. And there's also a movement around platform cooperativeism. There's multiple versions of this that have cropped up on the left. So I fully expect people to have some interesting counter arguments to this. I guess I would say going back to the same thing about the technofix, for me, this is saying we could do blockchain socialism. It's like, well, is this because you just stopped fighting for regular socialism or why does it's like why is blockchain involved here? It's like I just feel like it's and I see the argument that we have failed over and over again to do this. But for me, it just seems like really bending over backwards to insert a sort of, again, like a sort of tool that we're trying to find a use for. And so I just want to question this idea that, oh, a new tool came along. Let's try to use it for leftist ends. But my problem is this is fundamentally stems from this kind of like techno determinists thinking, this like digital utopian thinking that tools that innovation is always going to drive forward. And while you'll be able to do some really cool projects, like that the points to you are going to be up against a very difficult tide of continuing to work back and have to fight back on the logic of the platform. I think I think I think if the last 15 years have shown us anything, it's that the platform will kind of fight this and in with the lack of sort of strong institutions, a lot of that work will be very limited. Yeah, I mean, I think I don't think this is a controversial take, but the cooperative structure, meaning a for-profit entity that is owned by the people who work in it, that exists under capitalism and it exists under socialism. And you can call it whatever you want, but it is in fact the same structure and a lot of people from either camp will agree on those things and we have existing examples of them. That in itself is kind of a limited horizon for what we may want to achieve, especially because there are actually existing examples of it. Beyond all of this, though, is I think what this current iteration of techno capitalism points to, platform capitalist organization of society, the foundational arguments that shaped the 20th century, Friedrich Hayek's knowledge problem, Ludwig von Mises writing, economic calculation in the socialist Commonwealth, what was, you know, referred to at that time as the calculation debate that free market economies would allocate resources better than planning. Those things have now been fundamentally overturned by the enormous, enormous aggregation of data through things like Amazon, Google, and Walmart. And so we now have, practically speaking, we have more perfect knowledge that Hayek was not even able to conceive of decades ago. And so this now opens up the possibility of economic planning in the 21st century with a possibility of realizing it at a scale that is geographically and economically larger than anything that is hitherto existed in the history of human civilization. That is kind of the utopian imaginary that we would eventually like to get towards. So drawing the line at like cooperative structures on the internet, you know, that's nice. But I think there's quite a bit further to go here would be would be my thoughts on it. Are our current institutions savable? You and I both care a lot about museums. We care a lot about institutional structures. We care about quality journalism and opinion writing, which both of us do. But I kind of feel like I'm not totally sure if our existing museums or newspapers or financial institutions would have are these things savable? Which ones? What do you want to keep? What are we ready to throw out? I disagree. I think they are savable, but only under a very huge, you know, if it's going to take a fundamentally different way to conceive what we mean when we say institutions, what we mean when we say these things. You know, the goal I have in this book is essentially for folks to come away from that question with their own perspective, right? I try to show what is the other alternative? What is there an alternative of like, of making platforms work for us? I think what I try to show in the definition is like, I don't think that's going to happen, right? I don't think that allowing this conversation to move towards this kind of techno-determinist idea that just because something is technically possible, it should be pursued is going to lead us anywhere other than the kind of similar road we're on now. So I guess I disagree. I think they can be saved. As much as I believe that they helped lead us down this path, I believe that there is a bright future for us reorganizing how we think about what's worth being either part of this institutional framework or, you know, what's worth actually valuing even as we kind of see more and more technology, more more and more kind of strange new formations come out of Silicon Valley and that sort of thing. So I'd say I think they are definitely worth saving and I think they can be saved. Yeah, I mean, I think it's to tie a bow on all of these things. It's similar to the transition from feudalism to capitalism where, you know, when you overthrow the monarchy, you have all of these just incredible paintings and works of culture that were exclusively owned by the royalty. And now the peasants are like, well, I don't know, does everybody get a painting? Does there one painting to everyone's house in the village? Like, what do we do with all the king's stuff? And then they create these institutions which house them. These are museums as we know them today that we're a way of holding these things in the public's trust in a way that made them available to everyone. But I think we're going to basically preserve the art of the previous regime as being like a time capsule of these like weird, gilded age in the early 21st century. Yes. I think that I would also say that another way of answering this question is the last maybe post tech lash set of years, we've seen a lot of the same kind of complaint. We've seen a lot of this lament. And every time someone sort of takes that and says, oh, let's make a different platform or let's make a quote unquote good platform. We see this now with Blue Sky with all sorts of reactions to this that sort of just layer on another different platform on the problem that the problem that we, for the most part, agree platforms created. So I think we're going to hit this point where we just kind of stop doing that play over and over again. And we have a conversation about, what are we really trying to accomplish here? What are the tenets that we take technology out of it? Take the medium out of it. Just think about what you want. Think about the form of what you want for whatever pursuit it is. It could be communicating social media, anything art, whatever it is. I think that's coming. Like I think that's going to be the next thing. And we won't be able to, as you said at the top, we won't be able to use the vocabulary we've been using. But I mean, I just think that I guess I do have some sort of faith that people are going to continue to get exhausted with what platforms have done. They're going to start to learn lessons and, you know, what we build from this point on. There is a good chance that we're going to essentially build institutions, maybe without calling them that. Yeah, I mean, I totally share your criticisms about Blue Sky. I mean, essentially the idea is that Twitter would function better if we just didn't have the conservative. So we will all exit to the new platform. Exactly. And, you know, extrapolate that out a bit further. The teleology of this thing is network states. You just remove the people that you don't like. Exactly. And you are already fundamentally playing on their territory. You're talking about non-contiguous territories and so on. Like you have seated any ground for anything that resembles the left. So yeah, yeah, give me a break. Mike, thank you so much. Your work is just such an extraordinary inspiration. You are as always so many years ahead of all of these things. Where can people get the book? Yeah. So you could find it. I almost want to say like anywhere books are sold. I think it is kind of everywhere. Yeah. Yeah. So it's distributed pretty widely. You can buy against platforms on Amazon. It's illegal. Even though that's kind of ironic. But yeah, pretty much any bookstore or you can buy it from the publisher at Melville House too. If you want to do that. Excellent. Yeah. Thank you so much. I'll put a link for everything in the show notes. Yeah. This is fantastic to talk to you. And we're going to do a in-person event, which we will announce in a forthcoming podcast once we confirm the dates. But Mike, thank you so much. Thank you, Josh. Thanks so much. More again soon.

      "text": "Welcome back to the podcast. In this episode I'm speaking with Yancy Strickler. Yancy is the author of the Dark Forest Theory of the Internet. He's the director of a new platform called Medalabel, and before that he was a co-founder of Kickstarter, the first crowdfunding platform for creatives. The dynamics of crowdfunding have massively shifted the cultural landscape. Alternative media, news, and culture, even this podcast would not be able to exist without sites like Patreon and Substack. But as explored in the recent Zine published by Medalabel, there is still this unanswered question of what comes after the creator economy. Do not research as an arts organization that began in the Discord server attached to this podcast. DNR has been publishing twice a week for the past two years, earning press from the Guardian, Days Magazine, and many others. Last year's book launch took place at the New Museum in New York City. It feels clear to me that what we're building is not just an online community, but a real-world arts organization that has staged physical exhibitions, sold out film screenings, book launches, and more. Yancy and I sketch the future of these new community projects. Spaces like Do Not Research, or New Models, and Trust in Berlin, new Internet Native institutions for the 21st century. Let's get into it. You're rebuilding what I would analogize to be a world of warcraft guild within those creative structures. When the unthinkable Black Swan event happens, this organization will be anti-fragile, or whatever the word is. It will survive all of the shocks. Yeah, I think that groups are a needed primitive on the web, which sounds weird because what's more internet-y than a network of people. Right now, we see them as a network of individuals, and we have a hard time recognizing the group as really something. Even a Facebook page is a weird admin product. To imagine a group, a selection of people who are moving as a body between services, between spaces, there's a great piece from Arthur at Trust about moving castles and the idea of a group that can move to any domain. I think we're mentioning that essay. Yeah, that's a great piece. So I think the group as an internet native primitive is weirdly, I don't think it exists, and that is a part of what we're trying to create in Metal Label is to imagine a group of creators who can move from platform to platform and still be them, and they can operate collectively. There's a bigger story that I see to what we're going through now. I talked a bit about on interdependence idea of what I call post-individualism. I just opened my notes to ask you that. Yeah, that's a really important phrase. I think would you define for our audience who are not familiar with that term? Yeah, so I come at this from a thousand years ago, around a thousand AD, there was a big revolution in European, early western society, and at that point, society was mainly a lot of many verses of Clans family based enclaves. There weren't very many large towns or cities that were quite limited. In most people's lives were dictated by what family to grow up in, what rules existed in that family. They worshipped the ancestors and the patriarch, and the family was the first religion as a quote from Joseph Heinrich in the book The Weirdest People in the World About this, but around a thousand, eleven hundred AD, the Catholic Church began issuing these edicts, prohibiting people from marrying their cousins. Unclear why they did this, but it seems like it was to break apart clan-based power, because at that time, what was typical is that clans would marry the cousins together within their family, so that the family had stayed strong, they had more children to work the land, and they're putting down the competition if the families were religion also. But when the Catholic Church issued this decree, it had an effect, and within a couple of generations, there was no longer common for that to happen, and there needed to be new spaces created where non-cousins could meet each other to marry, and this is where cities and towns began to take off, because there had to be this new social context where how do you meet other people? Within a century of this beginning, there were these major revolutions that occurred. One is that cities and towns began growing exponentially, and there became many more of them, because there were many more individuals, newly liberated individuals, needed places to meet. Also guilds started becoming an important institution, and they were a way for people to enter a trade and to have a context in which they could work. Universities were invented so that there was a context in which people could study, and really a lot of what we think of as modern society began around this time. And so the way that this book by Joseph Heinrich encourages us to think about this is that they needed safety, they needed context, they needed some way to know how to navigate with each other as free individuals, free people in the world, and so these institutions were created to do that. I think that the story of the internet is the same, and that the internet re-individualized us. Once you log on, you are no longer the child of whoever your parents are, you're no longer of a geographic place. You can decide whoever however many you wish to be. It's suddenly just this infinite expanse of identity. And for the last three decades, we have been the early pioneers of this new world. Increasingly, what we have found is that it is not always a safe space. When it's wide open, it's hard to know what to trust. It's hard to know your place. There's all sorts of downsides of this. And so especially in the last five years, there's been a greater and greater shift into more closed social spaces, spaces that are higher context, harder to get into. And I think of these as the guilds' universities of the 21st and future centuries, and that these are new social institutions where we are creating safety, meaning work, value, economic support for ourselves. The last thousand years of human history was really dictated by those evolutions that were happening in Europe in 1100 AD. And I think the next, I don't know how many hundreds of years of human history are really being kind of speedrun by all of us right now, trying out these different spaces, trying different configurations of how we relate to each other. But really, I think we are creating the social institutions of the present and the future. And so someone getting weirded out or duped or rugged by open social media, one of the steps I think they rightly take is they begin to look for higher trust places. They go to the dark forests of the internet, a piece I wrote a few years ago, trying to understand why was I more fearful on open channels? Why was I more and more writing things privately, but not publicly? And so I think that there's just this larger wave that we're a part of of just newly liberated people experiencing the exuberance and freedom of no editors, no filter, be whoever you want to be, indulge in whatever subculture create, whatever identities you want to create. But then we discover that we're not always safe, that we feel isolated. I think we discovered that while you can create infinite identities, our amount of energy is finite. So the more you put into your alt, the less there is to your IRL self. Time is very precious too. It is. And so, so that's that's what I feel like we are reckoning with for you to experiment with, well, what are models that can trace I can put around do not research that lets it fulfill the values that feel most important to me. That is a that is a proto institution. And that is a model that it's likely that someone else iterates on and that becomes a structure by which other people are able to create meaning and a clearer source of truth together. And the internet is such a hard reset. We underestimate the degree to what a hard reset it is. And so these sorts of experiments and projects I think are much bigger than just a solving or individual problems. I think that we are we're fumbling and searching and optimistically building for something much bigger. You mentioned dark forests. I wrote the dark forest theory of the internet in 2019. I think it got published. I wrote this piece about, yeah, why do I feel afraid to be myself online? Why do I feel safe in these other spaces and attaching that idea to Xi Xiong Luz's dark forest theory and the Fermi's paradox of the reason why the universe is quiet is because everyone knows it's not safe. And so you don't show yourself. Like the rational thing to do is not show yourself. So I wrote that piece. I think three days later, Vincatash Rao wrote a piece that was a response to it. We reintroduced the idea of the Kozy Web and Cottage Core. And that's where those ideas were first introduced. A couple days after that, the designer and engineer Maggie Appleton made a amazing design of showing clarinet dark net dark forest this interesting illustration of the web a couple years or about a year after that, Carly wrote a piece maybe it was for document about the internet didn't kill counterculture. You just won't find it on Instagram. And also had a piece with Julien earlier this year about holographic media. So it's looking at the state of the web today. Lath Bincada, who's a part of Do Not Research also has a piece in the part of this. So I reached out to all these writers. There's 10 of us said, you know, I think I think all of our pieces are a kind of a cannon. Yeah, it is asynchronous accidental cannon that I view my pieces. It began a conversation. But like I think the things that the people said were, you know, took us so much farther. And what if we collected these into an anthology and what if we were what if we were a kind of a label? And so everyone was down for that. And so this fall will will be releasing the Dark Forest collection, which will be a physical book collecting all these pieces with some new context. And the ideas one to use a similar economic models I've talked about of will sell a work we have pre-agreed splits that will come from the sales of that in addition. 30% of the money from those sales will go into a treasury managed by the Dark Forest collective by our label that we will use to fund further projects. And so there's already two other projects that will be coming in the months after that, another book and then an event hopefully. This was a, I don't know, a real-time accidental manifestation of the ideas and the piece and the conceded and desires of metal label. And yeah, to me, I don't know of a great analog or something that's happened like this on the web before where they're just like what is beautiful about the web is the call and response creates these cannons and these, you know, dialogues of knowledge that isn't just one node, but it's all these nodes together. And what's a way to express those and to to make them real, to celebrate them, to give everyone their spot as a part of it? So yeah, that that will be coming out later this year. And yeah, Carly's, Carly's work has been incredible on that front. Yeah, I mean, all of those essays, I think, are a formative in how we approach organizing the community and the content feed. And, you know, at some point, I realized that the podcast was not the end project, but the podcast was the necessary strong signal to collect a group of like-minded people with a shared value system. And then when you have all of that creative potential together, the point is then to build something durable and long lasting and to carve out influence for those ideas and to really create a permission structure for people to be able to publish work that is that is in that style and aligned with those values, you know. And when I first published Politgram in the post-left, I really hesitated because I just didn't know of another project that was like that. And I didn't know if it would be valuable or if anyone would want to read it. And I think probably if there was an organization like Do Not Research, that was like, oh yes, absolutely, we want to publish that. I would have not hesitated at all. But I think of this because I was literally- I was passed on by several institutions to publish the work where- I mean, it was offered to them, I think, largely for free. Maybe it was like a $75 contributor fee or something like- I mean, big established institutions and they just weren't interested in it. It's curious because then you go to crowdfunding and you're like, okay, well, actually this is quite valuable and a lot of people want to hear about this. Clearly, these values are shared by many but not the institutions of our time. So- yeah, building one. Yeah, exactly. So create your own institution. I will end up published the post-individual piece. We'll end up being a part of this book. And I think of the Dark Force Collective's purpose is going to be- to explore and perhaps help manifest these social institutions of the internet-native social institutions, which are not- they start on the web but they go far beyond that. Like, the post-individual ideals are- if you really think about them, it's, you know, on the web, we have our alts and part of many communities and I think all the communities of the internet are micropersonas joining with other people's micropersonas and creating little worlds. But like in the traditional world, there's maybe in a democracy, there's maybe no idea more core than one person, one vote on the web. It's like one alt, one vote. Like, one person, one vote is like, that's irrelevant. No, that doesn't matter. Like, that makes no sense. It's, you know, each self has a vote. But we have to acknowledge that there are many selves that play and I think eventually these ideas are going to filter back into physical institutions, into other structures that are- yeah, are going to break as a result of them. But I think that's the- that's the force of the degree of change that is happening. Yeah, I- I'll tell this very quickly because I want to ask you about some of the nuts and bolts of metal label and some of the technical specifics that I find very interesting. But I think back to an anonymous meme account that I disown and have no association with that maybe existed like 10 years ago or something. But we had the idea at the time, people would distrust art forum and freeze and all of the other reputable magazines because they only had positive criticism of people who are advertising the magazines and there was just a clear conflict of interest. And although this account was anonymous, it was uncompromising in its criticism and people would trust it. And so what we were predicting was an inflection point in the old institutions, in this case, legacy media, where I think now today there are so many stories like you can count on you're going to run out of fingers and toes in the past year of just how many issues the mainstream media was grossly wrong about. Not like a little bit wrong, like really wrong. And so there's going to become this moment of reckoning where when you see something published in the legacy media, you're going to think, oh, this is not a legitimate piece of information. This is state-run media or this is a piece of propaganda or its presence in the quote unquote paper of record causes it to be delegitimized. And so what people are going to search for are trustworthy places that have a rigorous editorial board that people cannot pay to be included on it. And that will rebuild the social consensus of trust and value systems and so on. So I'm very long on this idea of new institutions to rebuild consensus reality. And it may not be possible to fight the elite capture in our legacy institutions. Unfortunately, that may be the case. But the thing, sorry, to segue just very, very rapidly into some of the tooling for this because you're you're making this drop, which is a book of all of these tremendously important collected essays. So I imagine when people purchase this, I really am energized by a lot of the web three options, but I also think it's very prohibitive for people. There's a USD option. And I'm imagining what people are purchasing is that let's say there's an edition of this tax. I'm just you haven't told me this. So I'm just hypothesizing there's an edition of this tax. Let's say it's a few hundred or few thousand copies and you get a digital version of it. Maybe you get a print version that you can redeem as an option. And then I think you might be buying a ticket to a launch party as well. Yeah, close. Okay. I was just going to hypothesize. Yeah, great. You're in our drop. So I'm just thinking you're the producer. If I would dance, yeah. Yeah. So it's going to be we have metal able to been running this series the past three months called quality drops where we've collaborated with the Ethereum Foundation and Goodcoin with water and music with song camp with refraction with different sort of more web three institutions to release work release artifacts of creative work. These drop pages are highly contextualized. It's like a catalog raised an a of the work. Here's the artist statement of why it exists. Here's the full movie credits of who else a part of it. Here's references and associated works that are part of this to help you better understand it. And then the works are collectible. They're collectible and an on chain format that we just called a record. But it's like a NFT that inside has a claim for a physical good or a digital copy of the work. And then alongside the on chain edition, we just have a stripe checkout of just buy the book. Typically it's like $70 for the on-chain edition of which there are 100 or 300. And then you can just buy a copy straight up and those will be 30 bucks something like that. But the actual output we're quite flexible about. If someone wishes to put work on chain, we think that's compelling and interesting. And there's lots of reasons to be optimistic about that. But we also know that 99% of people don't feel that way. And so then you have just a traditional just sell the work. So this book will be, yeah, will be as you said, a edition of yeah, 1000 some copies. There will be a couple different means to purchase it. Yeah. And you'll be able to see where the money of that, where the money you spend flows. So it'll be split equally between the all the authors of the book minus a percentage going back to the core treasury. And also we use the structure of an advance, something that metal label will be releasing in about a month. But we've created an advanced pool, a pool of money, where groups releasing work can get an advance for a project. And just like the discord model I mentioned before, it's a 5050 split of financial proceeds until the recoup is paid back. And after that 90% of the proceeds go to that to the creator of the label. So in the case of this project, there's an advance to help pay for some of the publishing costs to bring on a designer. Yeah. And to me, that way of working of a group of people who have their each individual pieces, none of which were monetized, you know, it just us publishing just on the web as you do. But we can bring that together into a larger work that really helps center the core ideas is something we can all feel proud of that creates an economic outcome for all of us. And that creates a pool of funding that can be used to do to fund more projects and to help think part of this will be an open call to, you know, do you have a piece about or an idea or something along these new institutions of the web like let us know about it. Maybe we'll fund you. Maybe we'll release it. You could be in our group, a part of our label. Right. Because you'll you'll accumulate this treasury and then you can, yeah, commission people to make new pieces in that style. Yes. And if it makes a lot of sense. And if we have a standard, the metal label platform suggests its standard will be 30% of the take going back to the metal labels treasury, the release club's treasury and 70% being split between the artists. And there, the hope, the idea is that everything that you drop, you are manifesting more what your core idea is, but you're also bringing more revenue and more resources back to the core project so that you can keep going to create a replicable system where releasing work provides resources to release more work. That is the key to unlock. And, you know, I think we'll be seeing after people's third or fourth release, what does that look like? You know, what is that economic system really? How does it play out in reality? Yeah. I mean, I think as excited as I am about a lot of the web three options to rebuild collaborative structures for creative projects, the major major hurdle for this obviously is that the process of I don't have a most recent count, but this project before the last book and published 159 unique contributors, we're now at a scale of coordination that is just not possible to sit down and give everyone a tutorial for how to do that. So the onboarding process is very difficult and having just a simple USD stripe thing is a huge advantage for coordinating groups outside of like 15 20 people or something like that. My friend Rafael Rosen doll theorized to me the other day that appreciating and accepting the idea of digital value is maybe a bigger hurdle than a wallet and a seed phrase. Sure. Just that notion of something that anyone can look at for free, it is worth me owning as an individual or it's worth collecting or supporting, that's still a big step for a lot of people to make. And I think it how how much that can change is an interesting question. I'm optimistic about that, but I also think about the streaming dynamics we talked about the beginning of right. You look at consumer behavior and consumer behavior tends to dictate how industries operate. Right now people show they're more willing to pay $11 a month for infinite for access to an infinite jukebox. They are $11 to hold the one of 500 of young marble giants colossal youth. And those are different audiences and bandcamp is amazing. Bandcamp is amazing, but yeah, it's just digital value is an interesting question. I'm long on these things. I do think that it will undoubtedly happen within the next few years. And I would say that because clearly in some of the research for social media, people are so influenced by content and some of these ideas that it shapes their lives. They join political organizations. They enlist in the military. They choose to have children. There's all sorts of things where it would be absurd to say that the digital content they consume did not have value because it's clearly shaping how they allocate the resources and make decisions in other spaces. But I think for the short term, I am concerned with just the accessibility of stripe processing because I have the opposite problem of all of the Web 3 rhetoric where I see these immense treasuries for these groups of like, I don't know, like 30 people in a discord. And we have like a giant discord and a thriving community that is actively publishing all the time, but we have no resources. So we're saddled with the reverse problem. When we talk about resourcing the organization and producing a project like what we did last year, this physical exhibition in Holyoke, Massachusetts at Lower Cavity. Thank you to Tony DeSchenza for hosting us so graciously. We shipped and produced 46 different works by 41 artists installed all of them and then shipped them back. That was a, I mean, it's an extraordinary show. I think I'm like most proud of that as compared to any weird internet project I've done. That one was definitely the best. It was the coolest, but it was tremendously expensive. It was like extremely expensive and to not do that in such a way where it was exploitative to the people who were participating in it where you would have to charge them for shipping their own work and then people would have to make decisions about, well, I can't make my sculpture this heavy because then I can't afford to ship it. Like you need to rid any of those, those things can't come into the conversation. It has to be just a space in which we allow for these inefficiencies. People can express themselves, create the work that they want to make and then we just let it happen. Resourcing at that scale to do quality projects requires considering these things on advance. Yeah. Well, to me, that gets to the line and the zine about wanting to make the joy of making work with people who you respect and who respect you. A group of peers making something is going to have an energy and I think it's kind of a truth if people are, have their egos and check that I think will resonate. If I think of a nouns, a Dow type model of that's more like a group of capital allocators who have all have the means to purchase this extremely high priced ticket. Then they're saying, come and make work for us and we'll pay you. It feels closer to the Steve Buschimi 30 Rock like Hey Kid's meme. It does a group of peers and so there's just like a truth of energy that comes out of, we don't know where this is going to go. This just feels like something to say versus capital leading the outcome energetically. It brings a different different spirit. Now a project like Jema by our friends Eileen and Lindsay, you know, that's they're super legit and have great taste and know lots of great people and I think that project will be great. But yeah, I think that resource capital resources are a problem but they're also like not a solution on their own. Right. You know, it is necessary but it's not, but it is, it on its own does not unlock meaning. If you have capital but you have bad editors, the capital will very quickly disperse and it will be left with bad culture and no money. Yes. Good quality editors is actually the key to all of this stuff. Yeah. I was about to reference Matt Dreyhurst, which I probably do on every other podcast, if not every podcast, but I was going to say that if the arc of professionalization is inevitable for any any type of new tool, any genre, any kind of young creative scene, then the best thing that you can do to offset the negative stresses and pressures that happen from professionalization is to have very good first principles in starting the project. So that means equitable splits of the profits from a project. It also means sharing the costs and the labor associated with it. I've been a part of enough young creative projects now that my nostalgia in hindsight, I was really nostalgic for the economic inefficiencies of those early systems. And I really liked chill kind of hang out, experiment with stuff, make weird work that you weren't necessarily sure how it was going to be monetized. And those things were really formative in my career as an artist and trying out different styles and just learning who I was as a creative. But within that period of time, we're talking about a 10 year creative arc here. A lot of those efficiencies were just ground out by Web 2. The streaming economy bankrupted every musician that I know, right? Like the art market went through boom and bus cycles. I saw it apart, giant artworks that I had invested in. I helped my friends literally destroy their artworks and move them out of their studios because the bottom dropped out of the market. And so in hindsight, I wonder if we had better founding principles for those creative projects if we could have equitably shared the booms and then survive the busts of those cycles. Given the increasing narrowing parameters of professionalization, if we would probably all be in business and still collaborating today and all those things. So yeah, I'm not allowing myself to be properly nostalgic for the inefficiencies. But I am trying to plan with intention, do not research as it flourishes into a new institution that this will be something that is durable with stands the test of time and is not a reading group that pops up for a year and a half. When you say inefficiencies, what are you thinking of? Inefficiencies, I would say it's very clear in the case of music where the streaming economy was super efficient in placing money where attention was. And if you had a album that had like 12 songs and there was one big hit, people would just stream the one hit over and over and they would ignore the rest of the album. So obviously this is preferential for consumers and not for the artists because the contacts and the rest of their project is stripped away. In terms of the inefficiencies of the art market, I think what I enjoyed was umbaring this from Mariana Mazucato. Her book, The Entrepreneurial State, was on my last syllabus. She's an immensely important thinker. She describes it as spillover value. So essentially what we were doing is selling these big tokenized artworks. All of the value of the discourse and the experimental projects that we were doing were captured through the value of selling big 40 by 60-inch wall works at like several thousand dollars price. And all the speaking gigs were unpaid and all the weird experimental projects on the internet were unpaid. But that generated the value that was then captured through the sale of the artwork. That spillover allowed for all of the experimentation that we were doing. But what happened in the bust of the art market is that you're not selling wall works. So there's no spillover. But you're still doing the experimentation online, which I've done for a decade. And you're still doing the discourse, which I am. We're doing right now. I've been doing for more than a decade. And you've been doing for longer than that. I guess we can't go back to the inefficiency. So we just have to make a plan that allows for those things that were important. We have to find new financial mechanisms to allow those things to happen. And if we don't, they just will not happen. Yeah. I mean, I think streaming, film, television, and music, very telling in that there's the Spotify pay musicians more argument or this argument that musicians should be better compensated for what they do, which I definitely don't disagree with. But just history has shown us that consumer convenience in the end is what wins and what determines the outcomes. And there's a reason why people moved from having download folders of MP3s on their hard drive to streaming in the cloud. And there's maybe an economic argument that those of us who buy things on band camp and who go that extra step maybe care about. But just for the vast overwhelming majority people that is not the case. And for these industries, these industries just, you know, they just want to deliver content to eyeballs. And they don't, they're working backwards from that, not working backwards from what an artist needs to support themselves. And so there's this, maybe to an artist, it feels like an inefficiency to those big platforms. It feels like, oh, market, market efficiencies are happening. You know, this stuff is finally getting straightened out. Exactly. And yeah, it's hard to know how to reckon with that except like, here is an utter truth of the world that is definitely not to my liking, but it's hard for me to see a way around it. But to like think about how, how do you protect yourself or, you know, how do you as a idealistic project not end up succumbing to the machine? There's like extreme examples that are very instructive of like the dogma 95 school of just, you know, it's a, it's a manifesto. If you break it, you're out. It's like black and white. And you cannot, you know, you cannot be Hollywood and do that. Those are just completely incompatible. There's like the discord records model of, there's economic structures that have certain outcomes. There's handshake agreements that are feel very different than any other system. And through that, it creates a cozy cottage core experience of hardcore and punk rock. And those are ways that you, you're just create a separate society that it's just incompatible. And you're just taking that from the beginning that that's the deal. But I think what often happens, and I think you've mentioned experiencing and a lot of people I've spoken to have experiences, a group of young people who start collectively releasing work, maybe one person becomes more of the star. You're the Michael Jackson of the Jackson 5. And your career goes in one direction. And the rest of the group does not. That's where a lot of these social agreements we have with each other become really challenged, break, I think most typically. And if I can just provide a bit of context for that, starting, for example, a Tumblr, that was a collaborative project between a bunch of artists, there will inevitably be one person in a collaboration, or a few people, you know, there's going to be a few people that have orders of magnitude more success than all of the founders. So you're looking at value that is created collaboratively, from which the profits are taken privately. The collaborative project becomes the launching pad for a few people to go on and have extraordinary success. Essentially, like retire at the age of 25 is what we're talking about. While the other people in the example I gave earlier have to saw a part their work and get rid of their studios. So what I think about in hindsight, this was basically a collaborative project. And there were a bunch of people who were co-invested in it in the form of a social agreement. It was not in LLC where when you file an LLC, if there's, you know, 10 founding members, they all own an equal part of that. And it seems like this extreme free markets just had the end effect of basically bankrupting most people in the creative projects, even if they are contributing something of value. I mean, I can think of websites that literally scraped our social media analytics to produce a speculative valuation for the financial assets artworks produced by our peers. So if that is just the ground floor, it would really be beneficial to have a few good first principles for those creative projects. And I look at the young people now who are in the discord who are publishing to do not research at the younger end, they're 19, 20 years old. And I'm just hopeful that it doesn't take them a decade to learn this and that we can figure out some of the things for how to found creative projects moving forward. Yeah, I mean, I think your point is, I mean, it is like the ultimate sort of scare story. And yeah, not an outcome that leaves a good taste in anyone's mouths. There's a lot of reasons for that, I think. But one is that I think often in these kinds of projects, discussions of money or discussions of ownership are delayed as long as possible. They feel so emotional, so much about ego and judging the relative value of each other that are all conversations that emotionally, I think sort of to separate if you take a market based approach or let's measure what each of us has done and what our relative value is. That's like it's so difficult vibe, vibe kill. You know, what I love about like the discord records model is say they had a standard deal from the beginning, we will advance you money to make a record. Profits are split 50, 50 until the recoup is paid back. After that, you get the overwhelming majority of the money and you own your work. And like, this is just how we do things and everything costs $10. That's our structure. And people knew if they're releasing music with discord, this is the arrangement. And it's there up front, they weren't negotiating a new deal every time. So it's like you didn't know if you were getting screwed or what, there was just a normalization that you were opting into or not. And so I think that type of structure, it's de-emotionalizing the conversation, it's like standardization, I think, can help and things like that. As I think about the metalable project, I think that is one of the important things for us to solve is to create that clarity and comfort about how money will work, about what it means to be a part of a project from the very beginning, very black and white thing that both parties have a say and control over. But yeah, there's a lot of, I think a lot of the hard parts of figuring out how to release work together with other creative people come down to these questions of what are we owed, what does it mean that we're doing this, what does it mean if this goes really well, and those are things that I think you can create those principles and values from the very beginning that can last and survive those sorts of moments. Maybe you're not still the same squad at the end of one of your work selling for millions more than everything else, but it can still fit within the same economic and social structure that you began with. I selected a quote here from a scene you recently released called a new creative era, so much of what you've said and your podcast episode with interdependence and so many other places where I've heard you discuss these topics, I just resonate with so much as a burnt out content creator who's looking to build new alternatives and so on. But this quote in particular just really struck me, we don't want to go viral, we just want the basics to make work we're proud of with people we respect and who respect us. That's true to our intentions and who we are and are not. And I think about, you know, I've made a lot of viral comedic works in my time. A certain part of my career is very much involved in early comedy on the internet and I tell jokes every week in the Twitch stream and I still do it. But I made the decision when I became a content creator that I wanted to produce things that were true to me and I didn't want to be an internet comedian. I've seen different things go viral, I've produced a lot of content and they'll pass three years now. I see what performs better than others and you know, we have this sense like when you're talking about you and your 150 Dunbar's number group of friends that like, oh, I did these three songs and that one was more popular, but the other two are still really good. But then when you open that up to the competitive dynamics of the attention economy, it's not just like, oh, that one song did a little bit better. It's like that one song outperforms everything you have ever made. The totality of your creative work, everything you made in your career by 100x that one song and it's like, God damn, I can't produce anything else. Like I should only be able to do that song because I'm so strapped for cash and resources that I have to do the Alex Jones, there's chemicals in the water turning the frogs gay podcast every goddamn week for the rest of my life. And I just, I don't want to do that. I don't want to do the comedy stuff. Like I care about other things and to be honest, I would rather just work like a regular job. Like I'd rather just be an accountant or something like or work as a dental hygienist or something that was not creatively fulfilling, but paid me adequately. I'd rather do that than have another thing that was like not true to what my creative interests were. So I've just become this like reactionary anti-web to platform character, which I think is a thorny contrarianism that is actually really productive in getting towards these topics. But let me ask you specifically about metal label. You are building the tools for people to find new ways to collaborate, to create work, to find a market for their work. There's a lot of friction on today's platforms that prevent that type of collaboration. On Substack, for example, Taylor Lorenz is the podcast guest on Thursday. I was able to tag her on Substack that cross-pollinates some traffic to her site. But on Patreon, like you can't do that, right? There's kind of all these weird ideological decisions that atomize people into individual content creators. The next kind of logical step is payment splits for appearing on podcasts or doing a guest spot in a video and stuff like that, which is still mostly done through this back end work around. If like, oh, come on the show and then I'll Venmo you after type of thing. But conceivably, that should just be already integrated into the base layer of any of these platforms, which it's not. And that's a curious kind of ideological decision, I would say, at the beginning. So maybe I can just ask you to tell our listeners a little bit about metal label and then we'll explore how some of these topics fit into what you're building. Yeah. To your point about these could be basics of these platforms, but they're not. All of the systems around us are still functioning on creator economy assumption that we're all individual, hopeful stars of our own channels. And that that is, that is what we aspire to. We're here to win the creator economy lottery of having the biggest TikTok today. And to be the main character of Twitter, like that's what we're all here for. And certainly we're conditioned to want that kind of want it slash fear it. But everything presumes that we are competing against each other for for likes, for reads, for all of these things. And I certainly feel that emotional pressure and anxiety of publishing work on my own. I think of myself as a writer who hates publishing the act of writing, they give ideas of working, like copy editing, getting something just right. I love like the happiest place for me. The moment I have to publish and my own experience of a work is supplanted by an audience's experience of a work is I hate it. I hate it. Even when something goes well, I hate it because my own intentions and motivations for making something, what it means to me, I feel like I'm giving those up in some kind of way. Interesting. That's something that maybe I just need to be stronger. You know, I just got to grit through it. But in my wife as a painter, we were talking about how great it feels to paint a work. But then the moment you show it to someone, it's just how they respond, how much they respond. All these things just color your own experience of something that is so personal. And that's, you know, seems like a fact of life. But it's something that I think for some people, maybe me included, it's really difficult. But in this project of metal label, I'm a part of a group of five people, all creative people with different skill sets. And we produce releases collectively, including this zine that you read. When I publish something in that context, it's a very different emotional experience where rather than like the agony of Oshed, I'm letting go of this thing I care about and no one, everyone's going to think it's boring or trad or mid or whatever, whatever the bad thing is to be today. It's the epitome of that. And instead when I publish something together, even if I'm the main author in our discord, we'll often talk about holding hands before something it's released. But this, I always have this image that we're jumping off a cliff together. And it, I feel more like, look at the great design that Ilya did here. Look at this great newspaper box that Austin, you know, executed for us to distribute this. Like, this is not, I am not centered here. The work is centered. The idea is centered. The motivation and hopes are centered. And it makes it more something I feel proud of than something I feel anxious of. And I don't think that's in everybody thing. You know, I think a lot of that is who I am and my own experiences. But as we've talked about that feeling and tried to express, yeah, the joy of making work of people who you respect and who respect you, to me, there's like nothing greater in my many different experiences and projects to be among a group of peers who you feel are you are all on equal footing. Like, I don't know of anything more enriching than that. Like, that's way more enriching than any individual success. And my experience and it's reaching for that. And, and then the project of metal label, it's trying to create the conditions where that is possible for a lot of creative people. A year and a half ago, we first published a manifesto that introduced the idea, introducing metal label. And it was promoted this theory that what an indie record label is, what a project like mischief is or McSweeney's or the Royal Society decades or centuries ago. All those projects are groups of people who shared some common worldview, creating an umbrella and then individually releasing work under that umbrella. It wasn't like they gave up their individual voice to be like, I am now discord member O2 or something like you're still you're still Ian McIe, you know, you're still smart, went crazy. And, but by putting yourself into a larger context, you're manifesting something more than just your own ideas and work. And that there's centuries of cultural success that has come from these models. When we express that idea, it was a very sincere like, is this, do people vibe with this? Is this crazy? Is this bullshit? And receive so many messages in the weeks after from people writing in to say, oh my god, I feel seen. You know, I've never known how to talk about what I do. Our group, we always feel like the weird ones at the party, you know, and so when I'm asking what we do, I feel like a Jenga tower collapsing. You know, and people just lacking social context and the social permission to choose to be a part of a group, to choose to have both a personal practice and a collective practice. And the idea that that could be normalized, that that was something that they weren't having to invent from scratch every day just to continue existing, that really struck a chord and gave us a lot of confidence that this was a project that had a real truth of it that we just had to keep exploring. In the past few years, let's say the 10 plus years that I've been doing this, I had my first show, solo show in 2013, but I was already collaborating on internet projects in 2011, 2012, and so on. I saw this era. I didn't properly understand it at the time, but I would, in hindsight, describe it as social media removed all of the gatekeepers. There's no editor between you and what you can post on the platform, right? There's nobody between me and what I can tweet out or post to YouTube or post a Facebook or whatever it happens to be. And I found that to be very liberating at the time, because I was, you know, I started out in photography and we are at internet art and neither of those were properly integrated into institutions. Some of that did happen in the following years, which I think is great and very exciting. But my sense now is that the creator economy in the Web2 spaces and this lack of gatekeepers has kind of been taken over by the dynamics of Web2 where I would attribute a lot of the stuff I've spent the last few years looking into is like the rise of really extreme ludicrous political influence and things like that to be a result of no editors or gatekeepers, right? Like the idea that someone would have beliefs totally beyond the Overton window and get a platform for them, this is what alternative media was built for for better or worse in some cases now mostly for worse. So from that position, you try to calibrate like, well, do we really want to return to this model of like the New York Times has the be all end all on any project whatsoever? Like you don't want a single gatekeeper. But I think this idea of creating a Balkanized system of mini record labels is empowering smaller gatekeepers and voluntary communities of self-association where, for example, in Do Not Research, there is no amount of money that you can pay to be posted on the blog. The way that the value created by people are going to absolutely lose their minds because everyone is allergic to finance and then I find myself in the unfortunate position where I have to rigorously think through these things or the project will disintegrate. But in the hopes of founding a new legitimate institution by thinking through all these things very transparently in public, the way that Do Not Research creates value is that there's a board of editors, largely me and a bunch of volunteers who go through and select what they think fits the ideas that this project is centered around. And if it passes the editorial consensus of that group of people, it gets published to the blog. But there's no way that you can just directly upload your work. You can't pay 50 bucks or 50 thousand dollars to get posted to the blog. If it's a shitty post and it's a bad essay and no matter how much money you pay, you don't get posted to the blog. That creates a different type of value. That's very difficult to recreate. But the problem is that on all of the Web2 platforms, that has just become ideologically but also technically impossible. It is technically impossible to create that. So that's what we need these new tools for is to re-empower smaller editorial groups to have a context and a consensus around what their values are as a community. What's been interesting about the metal-able projects, it's been a live and in public exploration and manifestation of these ideas where we as a group of people keep having releases and drops that are very sincerely and earnestly just trying to express what we feel like is next. What we as a group need to operate, we've adopted a strategy of progressive productization where we do something for ourselves. And then if it works for us, then we figure out how to make it available to other people. When we released after the Creator Economy, we made this on-chain, traditional fiat release structure for how to put out a zine that went extremely well. So then we made that something that 30 other groups have used in the past few months. Similarly, we started giving advances to people, just realizing, oh, there's like three grand would make a huge difference to this project. Like, how can we do that? And so next will be productizing an advanced structure as a way for any group of people to be able to distribute money to each other to release things. So I kind of look at we've had eight releases so far, but all of them are true to a moment in time and true to us sort of coming to understand what this project is and is meant to be. Yeah, and constant doubt and uncertainty along that path. But like, the act of releasing is an act of manifesting. You know, it's like the more time you sit together saying, what should we do? And you like try to moneyball some strategy for your project. That's just death. That's just like you're just amplifying anxiety within anxiety. Every time we release something, just get energy. And you know, we just learned to sort of follow what feels most true to us as a group. But it's not long after a group of people decide to do something you get together, you get into the thorny or questions. Well, how do we how do we decide things? How do we do things? And that's another area where we're going to be quite opinionated and try to share a lot of ideas for different models and different ways that people can approach. But I think I think a level of deep thinking on that front is also important to getting those values right from the very beginning. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I'm very excited for what it is that you're building. And I think it's absolutely necessary because the culture of the last few years that the internet is built to support is just I think very disappointing for a lot of people. We've got enough viral videos for the next century. But we're missing these kind of cool, creative, just weird things that don't neatly fit into any other box. So you have to build that container to allow it to happen. So yeah, I'm very excited for it. And thank you so much for making the time to talk with me today. Yeah, I appreciate it. More again soon.

      "text": "I think people who are in the discord will be familiar with your name and your work, but for people who are listening to the podcast audio watching this on YouTube, or maybe you're just a random stranger who found this stream. I'm God knows how. I'm talking with Page KB. Page is an artist based in New York. You have recently mounted solo exhibitions at KaJay and Blade Study, and you are featured in this cute exhibition at Summer Set House, which is I think interesting and historic, and we're going to talk about that as well as the exhibition that opened in Germany, and this kind of weird moment where art is intertwining with the internet. Yeah, anything I miss there in your intro? I'm also a writer. I had a few different roles within the art world for a number of years. Yeah, I consider you to be someone who is very knowledgeable about the formal, official art world. You have extensive experience writing in a few different hats in the art world. You are also a member of Do Not Research. I think you are included in the 2021 to 2022 book. Yes. I guess we all kind of make art, we write, and some of us have to livestream. Now I've forced it upon you, actually. Welcome. I'm branching out. Do you want to tell us maybe a little bit about the show in London, and I'm going to share, I'm going to pull up on the stream here. These two very unusual influencer walkthroughs, but maybe, yeah, tell us a little bit about the show, and then I'll share my screen for the media. Yeah, so the show, it's called Cute, and it's based on surveying this aesthetic throughout contemporary culture, through contemporary art, but also through things like fashion, music, memes. It also crosses international boundaries, so it kind of talks about it as a development of a category in terms of American culture, serving within the 19th century industrial age, and then also talks about the Koei aesthetic in terms of Japanese culture, and then how those two have kind of converged at this point in terms of a globalized, revolving around the sort of values of Cute. This is a rather unique exhibition as far as rosters of artists go. I'll just read out some of the names here. I'm not going to do all of them because there's like, I think, 30 artists in the show or something like that, but yeah, it's, I mean, it's insensitive. We should be clear that the exhibitions we're talking about are massive. These are not like little tiny group shows in a project space. These are like big institutional exhibitions. In this one in particular, Cute at Somerset House, Hello Kitty is prominently featured alongside other names that you may recognize Mark Leckie, Mike Kelly, Ed Fornielis, a friend of the stream actually, he's been on the stream to play Dungeons and Dragons a few times, Hannah Diamond, Julianne Huxdebel, Rachel McLean, Julian Chacaldi, Paige K.B., you're in the show, of course, Maggie Lee, Bunny Rogers, a whole variety of artists, many of which are from London, mostly from Europe and Japan, it seems. Yeah, it's here. It's really international. There's an artist I believe from Singapore as well. There are a few different artists, but yeah, it's definitely strong, continued to British artists, which the British press emphasized in the coverage. Let me share some of the coverage here. I'm going to zoom out on my screen for a second. The thing that strikes me in particular about this exhibition is that when I first encountered it online, I was seeing these kind of influencer walkthroughs. I think maybe I saw it from you and maybe I was just served one of them by the algorithm. I thought that it was some type of immersive experience, the Van Gogh exhibition or the Climbed, or I mean, I pass a dozen of these just walking downtown now. This is museum of ice cream type of thing. It pans from Hello Kitty to Mike Kelly, which I'll put in a separate video. I've never seen anything like this. There's an exhibition about cute culture in London. The whole place is adorable. It celebrates Hello Kitty's 50th anniversary. It's a Hello Kitty disco and arcade where you can play Kauai games, places to relax and immerse yourself in cuteness, and you can experience your own magical girl transformation. First it explains the origins of Kauai, which I think is so interesting. It includes art and how cute is influenced other parts of our culture, both in Japan and in the West. It's also about how cuteness can make things more friendly and can also become creepy and monstrous. It's on at Somerset House in London until the 14th of April 2024. I enjoyed it so much. There's also an adorable Hello Kitty theme cafe, which I'll put in a separate video. Billy went to the cute exhibition and no one there knew of you Josh. Thank you Billy. I'm getting cyberbullied on my own stream here. Let's watch this next one. Cute at Somerset House is a massive. I'm time outside at the set and I've just been to the most adorable exhibition. Cute at Somerset House is a massive, trippy, ultra-colourful journey into the history of cuteness. There's plenty of family-friendly fun, including a Hello Kitty disco and a games arcade. But that cute facade hides a serious art heart. This is a show full of critical clever art by people like PC Music's Hannah Diamond, Ed Furnillis, Mark Lucky and Rachel McClain. And that's the best stuff on display. Come for the kids. Stay for the art. Cute! Page, I've seen nothing like this as long as I've been doing this kind of thing. Trying to figure out where to begin. Nevermind. I've been doing this kind of thing. It's wild. It's really interesting. Yes, no, I'm glad you played particularly that Time Out London reel. So Time Out London is a publication. It's actually like a see publication and they published a review of the show by the art editor, Eddie Franco. So there's a proper review of the show. It was very positive. But then they also published this kind of content walkthrough, which is similar to the kind of content walkthroughs that these influencer type social media accounts are also posting. So I was very interested in the similarity of that publishing that they were playing both sides of it. And I think that's interesting because the show itself is playing both sides of it. The show has this whole Hello Kitty section, which is the most published in terms of social media content aspect of the show because San Rios is a sponsor for the show. And so that's the part they sort gets a repetitive circulated. But then there's other parts of the show that are a little less circulated within that here. But I think it's interesting because that's the thing that then maybe lure people into the show. Then they get hit with my Kelly. Then they get hit with Cosmove on Bonin. Then they get hit with Mark Levy. They get hit with me and Flannery Silva. In a way, I feel like the way the content, what the content is doing is very similar to the way I think the curators are kind of savvy about structuring the show in order to have something that where you have a Venn diagram, a very unique Venn diagram of this kind of very appealing, populous kind of social friendly content, which is accurate, I think, to the theme of the show of cute. But then it reels you in with that in order to hit you them with a more sophisticated idea. And I think this is true to how the like what's written about in the catalog in terms of the essays, the fact that a scholar, Shen and I's book is sold in the gift shop at the show at the end. So you know, you can buy a Poussin nail file. And then you can also buy from Harvard University Press. Shen and I's are aesthetic categories from 2012. So I've never seen anything as you said, I've never seen anything like this before. Yeah. I can think of examples. I mean, I guess people always, they cite the art of Star Wars as being like the most populous exhibition at moment. This is like decades and decades ago. And then, you know, in living memory, I remember when the Tim Burton show opened like museums, you know, institutions periodically do stuff like this. But then this is extremely online. It's very visible. I mean, I think it's orders of magnitude greater than the visibility of any of those previous exhibitions. And then they also decided to put like real rigorous institutional canonized art alongside contemporary art and then all of these, you know, obviously very popular things. So it's a rather unique thing and has become kind of a destination for tourists, tourists and influencers, I should say, which is fascinating. Paige, do you want to tell us a little bit about the work that you have in the show? I had looked on the site, but they're very tight about install shots. I couldn't really find good documentation of the work that you have on view. Yeah. They haven't published installation shots of the show. I have two works in the show that were in my blade study solo show that was on view last May, May 4th through June 4th on Lower East Side. They had initially found my work through my cause show that I a solo show that I did in 2022 at this project space, cause in Brooklyn. I think they had found that because the show is on contemporary daily, the install shots from that, but also I'd cite specifically in the press release that I wrote for that show, Shannon Eise, some of her ideas from her book, Arsetic Categories. So it was a direct through line from her theme. She talks about cute, zany interesting as three aesthetic categories and how these are sort of the aesthetics parks along, so contemporary capitalism. So I was focusing on the cute aspect of it, but so I have a painting in the show and then I have a sculptural ready made sculpture work, which is a chair that features a book that I wrote. And it's also my longest form piece of writing. It's a 96 page book. It's a 20,000 word art history essay that I was commissioned by the artist Jay Chang in Qutake, Maeda. And it's had on the chair with some dried cherry blossoms and then it has the stuffed digi carrot, animal feet, slipper feet at the feet of the chair. So it's combining a gesture of institutional critique related to what I'm writing about in that in that text with the cute aesthetic of the anime character. If you're not following page, I've got your Instagram on the stream here at guilt group. I'll put this on the screen for a moment. I was like, I remember seeing this online. Yeah, the feet are, I have to say, very cute. Okay. Well, this is, this is particularly interesting to me now because I've just returned from Berlin. I was over there for a whirlwind trip of like, I don't know, 48 hours, 72 hours, something like that. Really going over for this exhibition at KW Kave, the Institute of Contemporary Art called Poetics of Encryption, which is curated by Nadeem Saman. Similarly, this is a massive group exhibition. I'm just scrolling through this on the stream that has 40 different artists. I'll just name a few of the people here, Cluster Duck, myself, Kate Crawford, Nora Elbaudry, Simon Danny, Sterling Crispin, new models, Avan Franco-Matez, how far, how far, John Raffman, Trevor Paglin, Daniel Keller, Rachel Rossin. There's like, I want to say that 20% of the exhibition has been on the podcast at some point. The curator himself, Nadeem Saman, has been on the podcast. There's also a book that accompanies this Poetics of Encryption, Art in the Technocene, which we, I think we put that out maybe two months ago or something like that. Fantastic book. I picked that up while I was over there. The show itself is a massive, all four floors of the museum. If you're based in New York, I would say this is equivalent, maybe a little bit larger than the new museum, just to give you a sense of the scale. It is one of the few exhibitions I've seen that really engages with the internet. This is an endless point of frustration for me in the last few years that obviously, the internet, social media, and so on, technology in general is massively transforming society, not to mention AI and all the things that are rolling out that are like, you can just see how it's transforming work and socialization and every aspect of life. It just seems completely unremarked upon by most of the art world. There was a period maybe like, let's say, I don't know, eight years ago or something like that where there was this very vibrant, emergent art where I think projects like Blade Study that you had mentioned before, page, I would say Sarah's Don't Constell. There's like a little bit of programming now that feels thematically similar to that time that's really trying to engage with the internet. But as a whole, I feel like the art world has taken this approach of pulling the ladder up behind them in that institutions got worried that in the genre of photography, for example, if they allowed new media to come in, then very quickly, capital P photography would just become the internet. It would become a platform that have to have animated gifts and video and websites and it muddy the distinctions of what gave them their medium and their institutional prestige and their space in the scarce budgets that are available for these things in the square footage of museums and so on. So there was a general reactionary turn in the art world. And yeah, it seems now that there's this giant show in London that seriously engages with the internet. A lot of these artists are people who are making digital work a few years ago who make work that involves like anime characters and things that you would frequently see on the internet. There's this massive exhibition in Berlin, the curatorial frame around this. I'll just give very quickly a plug for the show. But Nadine kind of breaks this exhibition into largely three categories of black sites, which involves data leaks and secret organizations and conspiracies and so on that thrive and flourish on the internet. There are black boxes, which relates to algorithms and AI and then there are of course black holes which these rabbit holes and spaces which seem to devour all of your attention. Notably in this exhibition that pay a GNI DMed about very briefly is the inclusion of certain works, namely the Deep State Mapping Project by Dylan Lewis Monroe. You are curious about how the art was curated into the exhibition and I checked on this actually in advance of our record. Dylan Lewis Monroe is not included in the list of artists in the exhibition. So the Deep State Mapping Project is strategically hung in the hallway between the different floors of the show. It's a curatorial gesture. I haven't spoken with the curator about this but my assumption is that because he's not listed as an artist, this is curated in as a ready made object that gives context to all of the other works in the show. There's a ton of research and different books and an enormous context to the exhibition but it's not like taking wall space away from another artist. Maybe an important piece of context there. Oh that's interesting because in the Q show they also kind of deal with some material like contextual in a similar way. The material will be described, serve on the website but not there on site or they'll have cultural objects on these islands but then on the walls they have artworks and the artworks have wall labels. Then there'll be more cultural artifacts that are gathered together in these clusters, these thematic clusters. Then you can look on an app and see deep, detailed descriptions of those objects. That's the thing that I find to be... That's always what I found really interesting and compelling about art is that it exists in the real world. There's a world outside of this and there are things that are significant or influential but might not be proper art. All of these things coalesce to create meaning in shape society. I kind of like in big institutional shows where there are things that are not proper artworks but lend context to the rest of it. I quite enjoy that type of curation. It was one thing I wanted to mention about the Deep State Mapping Project as its inclusion in institutional shows is particularly interesting because it comes from the source of that comes from a kind of a very troubled sort of source. These are things you cover all the time but that's not a source that institutions are generally presenting or dealing with. It's interesting that that also being KW Neumann was being the show because then I also think about what Carly Serves has talked about publicly about her leaving texts or couldn'ts about how there was a discomfort at that institution about dealing with that kind of material. Yes. It's funny. I wrote about QAnon actually for art forum back in 2020. I was researching some of these kind of cultural things that were sort of emerging around QAnon. Not because I was part of QAnon or part of that culture but I was interested in what kind of aesthetics were emerging sort of out of this kind of cult. I'm canceling you right now. I'm commenting on your Instagram conspiracy theorist. Well, I've already done public. It was published in our forum years together. I remember I wrote like a critics pick of another show around the same time where I was thinking about that aesthetic of the Deep State Mapping Project and I mentioned it. I was the one that had Dylan Luie Monroe mentioned in our forum. I mean, obviously this material, anything dealing with the internet is very difficult for the art world to metabolize, very difficult for museums to metabolize. But then if that material is also adjacent to extreme radical politics, that's like doubly difficult for them to work with. So it's taken a long time to have a rigorous conversation about any of these topics. And the inclusion, I guess we should maybe add context for people who are not familiar with German institutions. But the inclusion of these materials in a German institution is especially important because they have very rigid rules around far right iconography and all sorts of things. You know, it is technically illegal and will violate the funding of institutions. So to make the argument to properly and officially see, for example, a 20 foot wall of memes by ClusterDoc, there's an amazing installation as part of the KW show. And it includes all sorts of references like Wojax and Pepe's and whatever that are pretty difficult for the art world to deal with given the evidence of the last few years. My hope is that this creates some type of a permission structure that it's okay to talk about these things are obviously very relevant and very influential. But museums have been a little bit scared to talk about them. Obviously the exhibition has gone over quite well. And I think it will encourage other people to do the same thing. Should we mention also that we saw each other, I don't know how many other times last week, friend of the stream Simon Denny also opened an exhibition of Petzel Gallery uptown. There's a group show on the second floor of that gallery, which includes many friends, many members of Do Not Research, people you've seen on the blog and so on. He also has an exhibition at Dundkunstall across the street. And I was thinking that if you put together the square footage of all of these exhibitions, cute at Somerset House opened on January 25th. Poetics of encryption at Kawe opened February 16th if I remember correctly. And the Simon Denny exhibitions opened on February 21st and February 22nd. So that's, you know, clustered within a month. There are three major exhibitions, massive amount of square footage devoted to these things. I'm totalling up all of Simon's shows, three different shows opening in the same city. And you know, three different cities around the world that feel quite remarkably different than the art of the last few years and are each really enmeshed and seriously engaging with the internet. Do you have any kind of thoughts about, I don't know, new trend forming, but it seems unmistakable that all of these big exhibitions are happening around the same time. Does that seem coincidental to you? No, it doesn't. It does feel like actually a watershed moment to me. What's interesting about Simon is, you know, he's been doing that work for some years now. So in a way, his work is sort of like, well, he's sort of doing and doing it. And so now it has a resonance with these other things that are happening. We have some younger artists. So that's maybe more kind of a tribute to just staying the course with your aesthetic, regardless of trend as trends come and go. But I think it feels like a watershed moment, particularly like institutionally. Like the fact that these are institutional shows, like there's been these project spaces like Blade, Steady and Noong Kinstala opening up in New York and there's been more shows and things going on like this and things percolating outside of institutions for some time. But I think it's the scale of something like a German institution and then a major British institution at the same time doing shows that incorporate memes that are dealing with and tackling the sort of issue of how do we present this material and also relate to contemporary art even just material formally. How do we present these? You know, Simon said, how does it in this way where they create these islands of objects and then these sort of boards with the memes where they'll show you the cultural art effect like the Junglescog bear and then they show you the meme of the Junglescog bear. So the fact that the institution is trying to do this as opposed to before where I think it was ignored. I think it's the kind of curatorial and institutional scale of this kind of material being presented and taken seriously. I'm particularly in the context of cute. It's demanding, provoking, I think, that this concept, this thematic cute should be taken seriously because this is what Shanaibra proposes, it's since like her book came out 2012. So these ideas have been percolating in terms of academia. But this is a kind of a very broad public facing way to on-ramp people into the idea that this kind of material should be taken seriously and that there's something interesting happening here to intellectually unpack. And it's not just about, it's not just about an uncritical embrace of consumer capitalism. To thread these two things together, I mean, obviously in the last few years there's been an explosion of aesthetics that combine extreme radical politics and cute aesthetics. I'm thinking in particular of anime profile pictures. I'm thinking of Malady's. I'm thinking of all sorts of different memes and would have you the kind of two things that are like most privileged on the internet are these like extreme ideas and kind of libidinal impulses. So clearly very influential, very influential posts in the last few years. Cute is very disarming and it's kind of hardwired into us where you see, I remember when Ed was doing the research for Freniliers, he was talking about the enlargement of eyes and a button nose and pink colors and things like this, things that are hardwired into human beings that make them want to care for infants. Basically, all of those are these deeply ingrained responses. And so wrapping extremist worldviews into cute packaging is a way of making something accessible. And yeah, obviously that has been quite effective in this case. I heard a put by a friend, I've heard a put by a few people that Trump put post internet out of business. And what they mean by that is that there was a big scene, there were writers, artists, curators, collectors, there were entire galleries dedicated to this genre or this moment of art maybe is a better word for it. And then alongside a market bubble that was back to back with just the insanity and the stimulus of Trump where politics became not politics, but like American theater as politics, American daytime television as politics just became the programming for like every museum, every publication. I would go to a show and like, you know, it was definitely work that was made like a year or two years before and then somehow shoehorned into the press releases like this is the most important election of our lives, type of shit. Do you have a sense of I guess what I was trying to game out in conversation with a few people is that there seems to be a moment cresting where people are once again very interested to talk about the internet to devote curatorial budgets to it to program shows around it to commission essays and so on. And those are all things I really care about. That's the stuff that I want to see happen. But we are also on the threshold of an American election where there's the possibility that Trump may come back into the picture and snuff all of the internet art out again. And we will just get this ultra reactionary turn towards identity and declarations of how Trump is actual fascism and democracy and whatever yada yada we've heard it all before. Do you have a sense of like what American politics is going to do to this like opening in the art world? I feel like, you know, I know that people talk about the long 2016 but actually do feel like things have changed since then, particularly in past a couple of years. I would even say since 2022 onward. So I don't think the Trump can sort of be given all the credit for the internet or internet culture or that everything this sort of has to some relationship to the internet or the digital can be associated with him. I just don't think culture can be that naive. I guess I guess I'm optimistic and I don't think we can be that naive again or that repressive. You know, it's interesting. I was actually thinking about something that the curator of the KW shows Nadim Samon said about analog cultures of the digital. This was a phrase that I was very interested in. How you saying once the complexity becomes too overwhelming, you have to use folklore or pictorial methods to explain it. Something is inherently code. Then you're back with analogy or doing analog cultures of the digital. That's right. That's what I think is interesting and operative. So you know, he carried the KW show set that I think that's operative in that show as far as I can tell. And I certainly think that's operative in the cute show. And in my work in particular is that I was saying this when I was doing walkthroughs of my blade stage show is that, you know, just because this thing is not 3D printed or is not a video or is not online yet, you know, then it goes and circulates online, of course, because this is an oil painting or because this is a pile of ash on the floor, you know, there were sculptures in that show where I just had graphite dust. This is talking about the digital. This is an artifact of digital. This is an artifact of always having your experience funneled through online and mediated through through a digital platform. It doesn't have to use that medium per se for it to be inflicted by it. And I feel that this is very important to understanding a culture and I think it's very important for art right now to deal with that that no matter what it is, I think we have to think about it and its relationship to the digital and what the internet has done to us. I told that friend that Trump didn't put post internet out of business. He just transferred me to a different department. So yeah, and then you get all sorts of other experiments that happen because of it. You get organizations like Do Not Research, you get podcasts, you get sub stacks and yeah, I just feel like it's going to be a very interesting few years because we're going to get this supercharged load of politics again, but then we're also going to have a robust institutional programming and artists that are capable to comment on it, which is what I always hope for is to like leverage the aesthetic expertise of artists and institutions onto the emergent behaviors and memetic activity of the internet. And I thought that that was a useful thing to talk about. And there were some things that we could discuss better because we understood aesthetics compared to journalists who maybe didn't spend as much time online or maybe weren't as familiar with how images operate and all of the complexities that you're describing. So yeah, I'm excited for this and I'm glad we got a chance to talk about it. I did the book launch with Simon. So we're going to actually hear from him on probably the way this podcast will come out is that there may be back to back or a week apart or something like that. Yeah, I'm just I'm very excited and I dare I say optimistic about this moment that three major exhibitions and three major cities all talking seriously about the internet that I'm feeling optimistic for the first time in a few years. So page thank you so much for calling in. I've got your Instagram on the screen. So you want to give just a plug anything you have coming up. I guess I might mention that the book that's part of the artwork in the summer set house show. It's also at Petzel right now as part of that Simon Denny group show. Of course, yeah, yeah. You can read it there. Yeah, excellent. Page, thank you so much for calling in. I'm just such an immense fan of your work and I really appreciate your contributions in the discord your appearance on the new models podcast. Every time I hear you talk about art, you shift my perspective and your contributions have just been yeah, so valuable and shaping my ideas about this space in the last few years.

      "text": "You mentioned before Foucault, there's a few figures within this world. I wonder if we could maybe spend a moment on Foucault, some of these priorities for today's left. How did these ideas become prominent? How did they take hold? I think Foucault is such an interesting figure because he rejects a kind of French leftism. He rejects Marxism. He actually says that he's creating a new historical paradigm, which is the epistomase rather than the revolution. Very humble guy, yeah, super humble. And a lot of his theories are read with Derry Donne mine. Let's look at Judith Butler sort of synthesizing the two of them because he talks about normative forms of being an institutionalization and discipline and punish in the care of the self. A lot of that was about looking at ways in which the Western world has dealt with the human body in masses. What I've always thought was really fascinating about his work was when he, especially when he was talking about the 19th century, he starts with the poor houses of the 17th and 18th century. Then he looks at schools, he looks at the church, he looks at the classroom. The one place that was like breaking through in the 19th century in terms of collectivizing bodies is the factory. He never talks about the factory. Which is so, and there's a work discipline in the factory which is really interesting. So it's really great for Americans because then we can skip the mode of production. We talk about being mad at school. There's like all these 60s and 70s. They were like dropping out, drop out of school. Antidus don't be disciplined. And he made like political gestures transgressive. His own work is really, really fascinating history. But what I find really disturbing about it, and I guess it's part of a whole tendency that is connected to affect theory, is that people use some of his terms as shortcuts to critique. Yes. And shortcuts to a historical sensibility. Like I think a lot of academics just decided that transgression in and of itself is good. And why do these things matter? Because in the hot ass of the graduate seminar, you have smaller, numbs of people. But liberal arts, colleges and elite universities train leader, thought leaders. And it then becomes disseminated through the culture. So you might have a full-co seminar. At one point, then you have Tumblr, my pony, boat. What does it call it? My pony, whatever. But 30 years later, but there is a kind of weird continuum. Between these phenomena. You take out the factory from your historical analysis. Who do these ideas appeal to? Like who is the target audience for this stuff? People who've only been to school. And you're a tip. And how should we consider these kind of like, essentially what we're talking about is campus politics, right? Like are these radical youth college students that we should dismiss? Or you consider them elites in waiting? Or like, what is the appropriate way of how seriously should we take campus politics right now? I think there being a clips at the moment because the Trump circus is so huge. But let's say that up until now, they've been really, really important, in dictating what happens in left-liberal spaces. Like you have generations of people who graduated from liberal arts seminars and joined TSA during Bernie, right? And we thought Bernie was going to create this material revolution, was bringing all of these people and were so dissolutioned with political, economic formations in the states. But when you get all of these like, I don't know, like, cultural studies majors in one room, their tendency is to move towards the cultural, towards the non-normative, towards the transgressive. So you see the, like, I saw this thing where Bernie was articulating a political, economic vision for American transformation. He called it a revolution, like, you know, a non-violent revolution, but he used term revolution, right? And it was very attractive to post-2011 graduates from schools because the economy was in the tank. And you get these people in a room and they can't really focus on it. I don't know what I'm going to get used to, you know, because their experience of work and work discipline is not that deep. They come from families that are, like, white-collar families. And so what they want to care, but their whole education care about political, economic formations, but they've been indoctrinated so deeply in identity, in recognition, in rejecting. And I'm going to say this, like, in rejecting a kind of intellectual tradition of critique that comes out of Marx, that comes out of Freud, so they have these fossil shortcuts to feeling oppositional. This is why I don't like to use the term woe. You know, I got caught up in that big brujaha over VVEC's podcast because, on Twitter, everywhere. It's a good podcast. Because VVEC Chipper released a podcast called, you know, it's like, is woe-gover or something on? I'm Jacobin Radio, and everyone jumped down his throat, and they said, you know, this is so horrible. And Sorab Amarie, who's that unheard, said, you know, you should write about this. And I was like, I really don't want to write about this because I don't want to use the term woe. I want to get at the root of it, rather than just the toughs of it. I think the VVEC's podcast was brilliant just because he was so casual about it because, you know, nobody likes woe. And obviously, like, all the people who Jacobin's audience and Jacobin readers were so infuriated because he touched a nerve. They, a small minority of people like this kind of shortcut to critique because they don't want to think about what they're actually doing and their class position. And you can't criticize them. Here's like a, let's imagine a healthier left where we can be skeptical, disagree with each other, but fundamentally say, William Claire Roberts, he wrote a good, not bad book on Marx, can agree or disagree with VVEC Chipper, who's written many, many good books about class. But no, this is considered a legitimate position on the left. Like, fuck that. You know, we need to discuss why left politics has no popular appeal, why it gets absorbed by liberalism, why we're in the situation today. You can't countenance a critique of the recent past. If you can't do that, you are fucked. You are not on the left. You are a dogmatic, dogmatic, petent. You are afraid. You are not politically effective. And this passes as just, I mean, it's on X. So it's like, oh, it doesn't matter. But it's there. Like, this very distorted and fucked up public sphere that we have allows for this kind of repartee. And I can't tell you how it does actually reflect the attitude, the extremely dismissive attitude of any kind of self criticism in left-liberal circles right now. And don't you think it's time for us to really think about what we've done wrong? Like, how do we keep losing? Who's the president right now? What is the merchant right? Their self-made meant, I think Trump is a good example. Actually, if the merchant writes someone who's made their money through activities that the Brahmin left to look down on, like, use car sales people who own use car dealerships often have lots and lots of money. But that activity is looked down upon by educated elites. Business, but no social prestige. We think of them as billiastians, right? Oh, yeah. But they are, I think, more engaged in the world. And from a point of view of American pragmatism, you could, from even Richard Wurtier, John DeWies Point of view, they're deeply involved in enterprise, in industry, in markets. So their scene is pragmatic, but they don't want to be removed from the world. The Brahmin left keeps wanting to close the gates around itself, gatekeep. Whereas the merchant right says, if you're rich, you're welcome. Like, we open up our arms to the enterprise, the entrepreneurial, you don't have to have cultural markers to enter the world of the merchant right. We're speculative. We like to take risks. This is probably what the merchant right wants to see itself as. And wants to see the Brahmin left us, closed off, less risk taking, futile in a way. Yeah. Is there a kind of analogy here of new money and old money? A little bit. Yeah. A little bit. But, you know, old, this is Piketty's point that the old money is so hidden. Right. You have to go through like economic accounting forensics to find how much power that old money still has. And I think that it's going to take a new form in the next few years because you've heard about the trillion dollar wealth transfer from boomers to their children. Oh, OK. Right. So that's going to happen when they, and that is happening now. And so it's hard to say is that older new money happening, but it seems to be class reproduction happening. Sure. Because the boomers came up and they, well, the top strata have accumulated as enormous amount of assets. And they're about to transfer to their children. Right. Right. And we were supposed to be in a democratic world fighting against the privileges of inherited wealth. This is the whole thing about the meritocracy and the professional managerial class. It was that it would be through personal competence that people would be rewarded and that we were not a country where inherited privileges would give you unfair advantages over your equals. I used to, I used to believe that too. And then, you know, coming from a background of the art world, I met a lot of wealthy people, wealthy people that if you totaled up all of the assets of my family going back to generations until you lose track, like less than one of these individuals, just dynastic, wealth, accumulation the size of nation states, no exaggeration.

      "text": "Alright, greetings friends. It's Chappau Monday June 5th, and today we are going to be discussing the life and career of the longest serving and probably most influential judge on the Supreme Court. That's right, we're talking Clarence Thomas with the man who literally wrote the book on him. Joining us today is the author of the Enigma of Clarence Thomas and the reactionary mind, Professor Cordy Robin, welcome to the show. Thanks for having me. So, Cordy, we wanted to talk to you about Clarence Thomas because like obviously in light of the DOBS decision and then his long-term relationship with historical artifact, the Fishingado, Harlan Crow, is certainly put the Supreme Court in the forefront of everyone's minds. And I guess I'd like to begin with like something we've discussed on the show that was very indebted to your work in your book on Clarence Thomas. So I think it's most likely to up in the conventional wisdom on Clarence Thomas, like who he is and his ideology. And that is like the fact that the basically like Clarence Thomas's ideology begins with the fact that he is or was, I don't know, I mean, I didn't know you're a take on this, but with black nationalism and radical politics. Like that defined his early political awakening and his early career, but like let's begin there. Clarence Thomas is politics as like in terms of black nationalism and black separatism and how that sort of upends the liberal conventional wisdom about who Clarence Thomas is and what his career represents. Sure. So Thomas, it was born in Georgia in 1948 into great poverty and when he's 19 he comes to the north. A lot of things that happened to him along the way, but one could say when he comes to the north and enrols at Holy Cross, he's part of a very small cohort of black male students, fairly illustrious cohort. People who go on to be illustrious. And he is radicalized by the experience of coming north. He had been obviously used to Jim Crow and his intense racism of the South, but in the north he encounters something new, which is what we would call liberal racists, liberal white racists. And these are people who in his telling are benevolent, friendly, overtly sympathetic to the progress of African Americans, but are always there to remind African Americans that they are benevolent, that they have extended a helping hand. And it is that experience that pushes him further to the left. He's already very much sympathetic and part of the black freedom struggle. And he becomes immersed in the teachings and the speeches and the writings of Malcolm X. He memorizes the speeches of Malcolm X. He listens to them on records, which is how back in the day people used to take that kind of stuff in. And he really takes a turn. He found the black student union at Holy Cross. He helps draft their manifesto, which has a very strong statement against interracial relationships, favoring much more race conscious black studies programs. He helps lead walkouts. He's the full deal. And we can talk about what happens afterwards. But the argument of my book is that a lot of the basic tenets that he soaks in during that period of time, even as he will later move to the right, he doesn't lose those tenets. And just very briefly what they are, is first a belief that white racism is permanent, that it is not going away, that it continues to structure the fate of black Americans. Second that black Americans have a fate and a destiny that's different, fundamentally different, and apart from the rest of America, that black people should look to black institutions for their development and protection, apart from white institutions, and that black men in particular are the group of people upon whom the salvation of black people more generally depends. All of those beliefs he develops while he's in college and holds on to onto the Supreme Court. I mean, you mentioned Malcolm X, but he also is quoted as saying he very much admired the black Muslims that he encountered for their attitude of essentially going it on your own, like don't expect any help or even asking for it. Now, and then when asked, you know, like what caused you to stop becoming a liberal, he says, I was never a liberal, I've always been a radical. Now, this follows a certain a certain well-trot path. Is this an old story of a radical becoming disillusioned and deciding they'd rather win than bang their head against the wall of liberalism for the rest of their life? And just joining the winning team, or is there something more here in Thomas's seemingly political and ideological confersion to like the Reagan administration, the pointy, and right wing Supreme Court justice? Yeah. I mean, you're right to say that that is an old, um, uh, Trotten category, and I'm glad you brought that up. Um, the group that I think that parallels a lot are the kind of the neo-conservatives, particularly Jewish neo-conservatives, who began on some, you know, part of the left. And oftentimes took a turn to the right, in part from a sense of Jewish particularism and a sort of a threat to, um, kind of Jewish collective identity. And I think there's a parallel there that's interesting to be drawn with Pirates Thomas. Um, the part that I would contest though is that I don't think it was simply about joining the winning team. I think there was a much deeper, uh, disaffection that really developed there with the idea of politics more generally. And when I say politics, I mean everything from electoral politics to social movements to more radical kinds of protest. Thomas, you know, beginning in, you know, the early, the mid-70s really develops a pretty far-going critique that that kind of politics is not a sphere that black people can ever win in. That politics is essentially the sphere of white people. And that any path you try to pursue through those means is going to be a disaster for black people. And he holds on to this, uh, point of view, well into, you know, well into the, again, into, into this, how long on the Supreme Court and that it's ironically that it's the marketplace and capitalism, the economy that he thinks really offers, I wouldn't say, you know, great possibilities for progress or anything like that, but but niches, let's say, or spaces to use a fancy term, um, that, you know, for where, where black people, particularly black people like his grandfather, these kind of strong black men can, uh, a mass property can amass wealth and thereby, extend their large ass and protection to the rest of the black community. And that's a pretty deep belief, um, that propels him and brings him toward the Republican party. Um, so, you know, everybody has some level of opportunism, obviously in them, uh, but, but I think it's, it's a, it's a genuine conversion. How does it like in Thomas's mind, like, how does he regard the, uh, the civil rights movement and like the voting rights act or civil rights act, we're about, which we're about political enfranchisement of black people in this country. Like, was he saying the like, oh, we, we should have just like skipped that skip and give everyone a business or something, like, I mean, what, how does, how do economic rights come absent political once in his conception of things? You know, I think he, the, the place to begin with an answer to that is, is his, his, sort of the biography and historically, he looks back on Jim Crow, uh, in the south, and he sees his grandfather who was, you know, one or two, uh, two generations removed from slavery, and his grandfather runs a, uh, a fuel business, a very small fuel business where he delivers first wood, then coal, and then oil to black people in Savannah. And he's able to, you know, amass a certain amount of wealth. It becomes a property owner. He eventually becomes a landlord. And, you know, there are no political rights for African-Americans during this time period. And I, you know, if I were to fill in some of the gaps of Thomas's argument, he would say that the black community was able to amass, you know, small pockets of wealth, um, and that the, without political rights, uh, and that certainly the, you know, he thinks the Voting Rights Act has been mostly, uh, you know, quite detrimental to African-Americans. One of his earliest opinions on the court, um, Holder V. Hall is a whole extended critique of the whole idea that black people could find their collective interests satisfied through anything, like the act of voting. So he's been pretty clear about that from the start, um, that, that's not a path. Whereas, while, again, I wouldn't say, I don't think he thinks that, um, economic progress is sort of guaranteed by any measure. Uh, he does think that you could sort of eat out these, you know, small places, where you could survive, um, for black people. Um, you know, and interestingly, you know, and he really is like the black entrepreneur. It's, it's not, you know, supporting the black, uh, working class. It's not, you know, people, you know, black workers working for big companies owned by white people. It's the sort of small businesses, uh, that he believes is kind of the path for black people to take. It's amazing. There's, there's, there's, there's, his, his opinion on the indelible nature of racism in America and the untranscendable barrier between white and black is one that a lot of commenters on the punitive left love to point out they, they, they make that a zack point, but then they all all end up saying, and you should still vote for Democrats. If that, with that, if that, if that is your overgriving critique of American political reality, then the Thomas, uh, response is more, certainly more coherent than to say, no, you should be voting for Democrats anyway. Maybe something will get better. And in the meantime, people like me will make money and be able to, to advance as like interlocutors between the communities. Right. And in fact, Thomas during the 80s, that, that exact issue comes up. And he says, look, you know, all you people quoting Malcolm X, Malcolm X never thought you should support the voting rights act. Malcolm X never thought that you should, you know, favor the Department of Labor investigating, um, you know, discrimination against the workplace, Malcolm X thought that was a completely, uh, you know, a misbegotten adventure. And so he, you know, claims very forthrightly that the logical implication of that kind of intense racial pessimism, um, or Afro pessimism as it's, you know, sometimes called, the logical implication is that black people have to completely vacate the political stage that there's, you know, not only is there nothing to be gained, there's actually some real harm that could, that could come from that kind of level of engagement. But yeah, I mean, I, your point is, is, is very much, you know, to the point, uh, and Thomas, you know, would agree. I mean, like, but at the end of the day though, he is still a political actor who is, you know, he is engaging in American politics in the way that like, you know, is supreme. The few individuals get the ability to, to do so and decide these matters. So I've been like, in engaging with politics, he's like, he's like, look, I've seen it, I do the political stuff, but I'm here to tell you it's all bullshit. And so that's why it's okay. If I remove certain rights from that we thought were sacrosanct or all agreed upon. That, you know, there's a couple of, like, you, you reach a couple of impasses with Thomas where, you know, things don't add up. I mean, not more than a couple, I should say. But that's one of the key ones, um, that I, you know, I don't think you can resolve within the framework of his own thought. I just think it's an impasse. The only thing I will say about that impasse is that it's very similar to the kinds of things you see in a lot of libertarian intellectuals who, you know, really, you know, have this sort of critique of the state and the state's involvement in politics more generally. And yet they are supreme political actors. Um, oftentimes those authoritarian parts of the state. And, and it's, it's, you know, I've, I've encountered this, you know, because I've written a lot about Hayek. It's something that's just ultimately not resolvable and that they don't provide any kind of theoretical account of. Um, and so I, all I would say about with Thomas is that it's, it's a familiar problem for I think a certain kind of right wing intellectual. Well, uh, speaking of right wing intellectuals, uh, the person that credited most with Thomas's seeming ideological conversion is the, uh, the thinker Thomas Soel, who I, is like one of these guys that I see routinely cited as among like the greatest right wing intellectuals of the 20th century. He should be taught in schools, whatever. Who, just like broadly, who is Thomas Soel and what about his, his thinking influenced climate's Thomas Soe Havily? Yeah. So Thomas Soel's an economist, um, actually was, uh, trained in, in the kind of the Marxist tradition, um, a little sketchy on, on how long he was immersed in that, but he comes out of that tradition and he, uh, gets then influenced by the University of Chicago, and that style of economic thought, and he makes a turn in the late 1960s, early 1970s. And, um, in 1974, I think it is, he writes a book called Race in Economics. And, uh, Thomas gets, Clarence Thomas gets a phone call, um, he's, by that point, he's living in, uh, Jefferson City, Missouri. And an old friend of him says, you know, I just read this review in the Wall Street Journal of this new book by this guy, and he sounds as crazy as you do, and you've got to read the book. And so Thomas gets the book, Race in Economics. And he's, he, you know, he sort of narrates it as a conversion experience. Um, obviously the conversion has sort of slowly been happening for some time anyway. And he, uh, I'll tell you more about the book in a second, but just to, you know, he, he finds out the, uh, soul is coming to St. Louis. And he goes, you know, he makes the drive up to St. Louis. He, you know, and he's got a whole bunch of copies to the book. And soul is coming to debate, turns out to be Ruth Bader Ginsburg, um, who is at that time a kind of up-and-coming lawyer. And what I think Thomas, you know, Thomas takes a lot of things from that book, but the, what's overwhelming in that book is this whole idea about the impact of capitalism on the black experience. And it's a very interesting reading. I mean, it's, it's totally fanciful and absurd, but nevertheless, uh, at the time was kind of influential, which is that the slaveholder, you know, was, you know, the white slaveholder is the, the master of his domain, the master of that space, but the one force that the white slaveholder could never master, the force that mastered the slaveholder was that of the market and capitalism. And you get this sense in reading that book that, um, even white supremacy and the, and the white slaveholder cannot overcome the powers of capitalism. And that's really what Thomas takes. It's almost kind of like a revenge fantasy, you might say. And, and it provides, for Thomas, a kind of blueprint, or a roadmap for his, his, his sort of broader move to the right and provides a, you know, kind of deep ideological infrastructure for him. Well, I mean, it goes back to this idea about like the political sphere versus the economic sphere and his, his, his, his, his like, you know, his great privileging of economic freedom as being a path to like actual freedom. And, you know, like it's, it's, it's not a, you know, totally ridiculous idea, right? The right, the idea that like, oh, you have all these political freedoms, but they don't really mean anything without economic power and the capital and like, you know, wealth and like a social network to build off of wouldn't that for some imply the logical necessity of distributing economic rights the way we do political ones and not the opposite, as opposed to like, you know, because it's not like Thomas is trying to like help out people economically all that much either or at least in the right and ideology he represents, least by my estimation. Right. So let me say a couple of things about that. I mean, the first thing to just say about that, that view is that, you know, Thomas and so were all that peculiar in articulating that and people forget this and, you know, in a lot of sort of the popular discussion of black nationalism and black power. First of all, people like Marcus Garvey and Malcolm X before he kind of takes his leftward turn were oftentimes making very similar claims about the position of black men in the marketplace that this is a sphere, you know, that, you know, build up capital, build up wealth, don't get involved in these white spaces, these white spheres. So there's a long history there and even more interesting is that in the early 1970s, a lot of black power activists who are on the left basically make very similar claims like, you know, forget it. We can't go this path of political power. It's hopeless. It's useless. We have to start experimenting with the market economy and of course the Nixon administration makes a big deal out of this. They take out ads in places like Essence magazine and Ebony magazine that, you know, black power is black capitalism and so forth. So Thomas isn't like neither Thomas Soul nor Clarence Thomas or if you sort of situate them, they're not that peculiar. But to come to your question, which is that, you know, it seems like for the left, the obvious implication is, distribute economic power than to people. And I think for Thomas, the problem with that formula, well, there's a problem and there's a different response, but the problem, the fundamental problem is that it can't overcome the fact of the white state. That would be a project in the same way that sort of trying to come up with fair voting districts where black people have more representation. That is a project that is ultimately dependent upon white power and so that you will always come back to the kind of magnificence and the paternalism of the white liberal state. And, you know, this is a pretty, you know, a deep seat and just to give you a sort of a sense of this in a framework. You know, Malcolm X used to have this distinction he used to draw between the wolf and the fox. And, you know, the wolf is, you know, bearish his teeth. You know, the second you confront him, he's your enemy, he's going to tear you to shreds, he's a lethal obvious over enemy. The fox can seem friendlier, not as dangerous, but he's ultimately just as much likely to seek your demise. And for Malcolm X, that was a distinction between white liberal racism and the kind of more obvious over white racism that you would see in the South. Prince Thomas takes this distinction on only he makes it between copperheads and water moccasins, but it's the same point of view. And that ultimately what you would say is that you just to think that kind of white liberals would reap that you could trust them to redistribute economic power through the state in the way that you're proposing is to expose you to a far more lethal kind of paternalism that would, you know, sort of stab you in the back just when you least expect it. And for Thomas, you know, he's asked about this, you know, how could you possibly be in the Reagan administration? And he says, you know what you're getting when you make your alliances with these people. Nobody's going to smile at you. Nobody's going to be, you know, friendly to you and then, you know, it's obvious who they are. And I, you know, for him, I think it's just a kind of a fundamental disconnect between thinking, you know, that these sort of white liberals are your friends and you could rely upon them versus the reality of who they are. And you might be able to advance a broader space percentage and segment of the African American population with some sort of redistribution, but there would be a ceiling on exactly how much you were ever able to escape the domination of white people in that way. Like you might have this general rising of votes, but it's still this universal condition of domination. Whereas if you have the, yeah, the market as a potential zone to compete in and succeed in, you can, there is the dream of like actual escape from domination and actual control of your own life. And like a few people having that is a more worthy thing to pursue than a universal sort of a welfare paternalism that denies the possibility of escape. Yeah. And I, you know, I think the really important thing to say, Thomas really is a racial separatist. I mean, I know he needs online and that creates all kinds of issues around his own life and Ginny Thomas and all the rest of it. I, you know, I don't have a good answer to her. Yeah. But he really believes like, you know, the bulk of black people should stay pretty far away from white people. And, you know, to emesh themselves to immerse their, to involve themselves with, you know, white liberal Democrats is, is, you know, a kind of a bad move. And yeah, the benefits that are going to flow to the black people are going to be few. It's going to be concentrated in a couple of, you know, a small cohort of black men. But that's the other side of this romance of his is, you know, it's, it's not a kind of a vision of a democratic black community. You know, again, you say black nationalism and people automatically think left, egalitarian, you know, and all that kind of stuff. You know, Thomas, you know, believes that there's a social community, but it is very hierarchical. It is very patriarchal. And that's, you know, he has said very clearly the salvation of the black community depends upon the fate of black men. And so, you know, you take the kind of separatism and then you take the sort of emphasis on black men. And I think the view starts at least cohearing whether or not it's, you know, even remotely politically plausible as a program. I mean, you mentioned that one of Thomas's, as long as one of his favorite songs is they smile in your face, backstabbers. And, you know, you can, I think I said a very good distillation of his point of view on a lot of this. But when it comes to like the redistribution of economic rights, do you find that like this is similar to trying to play gotcha with him on benefiting from affirmative action? Because at the end of the day, it's, you know, fruit of the price and tree. It's something given to you that ruins any advancement that you may have in society. Like, for instance, like, Matt, I think you said on the show, like he hasn't even enjoyed being a Supreme Court justice because in the back of his mind, you know, someone just gave it to him because he's black. Yeah, I think that was well put, you know, this is the tricky thing with Thomas is that, you know, people always try to come up with these gotchas and usually he's like told a story that's more gotcha than gotcha. So, you know, it's very hard to pin that kind of thing on him. But, but yeah, I mean, it's interesting you bring up about being on Supreme Court. There's this famous interview with him from an Esquire magazine sometime in the late 90s. I can't remember when. And what Thomas would oftentimes do was he would serve as kind of a mentor figure to black students and high school students in the Washington DC area who were poor and working class. And, you know, he would meet with them and so forth. And so the reporter is the witness to this meeting and Thomas is talking in his chambers with this high, this, you know, black high school student. And they're chatting blah, blah, blah, blah. And then finally he says, so what are your plans for college? And, you know, it's a very warm and friendly discussion. And the student says, oh, I got into brown. And, you know, you could sort of the the the the temperature just like it drops in the whole conversation. And Thomas says, you know, Thomas says to him, oh, that's, you know, that's not a good idea. You don't want to go to brown. And he says, you know, you got to understand, you're going to, you know, basically you're going to go there. You're going to be surrounded by a lot of white kids. And you're going to see how lonely that experience is. And he says, and then he says this thing that's just kind of incredible. He says, you know, I oftentimes feel the same way myself today. You know, and he's been on the Supreme Court for, you know, six, seven years at that point. But, you know, he's narrating the sense of sort of isolation he feels as the one black at the time, the one black person in a sea of white people. And this is something that he brings up in the kind of conferences they have on the court constantly that like he's, you know, again, it's changed now. But at the time, you know, I'm the only black person on the court. I'm the only person who went to segregated schools. I'm the only person who went through integration. So it's not, it doesn't seem to be like an experience he takes much pleasure in. I'll always give him credit for the thing that liberals like to make phone of him for, which is not asking questions during arguments. Yeah, part of that generalized, like seeing through so much of the, the ritual bullshit of this whole thing of like, we all know how we're going to vote. What, what do you got to asking these people questions for? We all know we could just do a show of hands at the beginning of this. This is a fucking joke. I have to say when I was writing my book and I would say even up until the first couple of years after when I came out, the single most consistent question I got from liberal audiences was why doesn't he ask any questions? And they just, because I can't imagine that. Like if they, if I was there, oh my god, I would want to just the legal, the legal battlefield. Yes, it's a, it's a real, you know, seminar of great minds kind of thing. And what's interesting though is you don't get that question anymore, partially because he started asking questions, but partially also because people have now begun to, one, wrap their heads around the fact that this guy is incredibly powerful. And so I've noticed a real switch. Not only do you not see, oh, he's, you know, and with that question about, you know, why doesn't he ask questions, it was always this assumption that he's done, that he's Scalia's puppet and he was actually called Scalia's bitch. He played O'Eister's. Okay, so people don't do that anymore. And now I do think part of why people are more interested in the corruption charge is that, I mean, in addition to being true, you know, they're, they're trying to reckon with his power, which for, you know, 20 some odd years that he was on the court, nobody ever, ever thought twice about. And now it's become clear that he's very powerful. And so then the question is, well, how can we make sense of that? And I think part of the corruption story is trying to come to terms with the fact of his power. You also write about like his becoming a Supreme Court justice. And how, in, with the benefit of time, he has only grown more angry about what he does, what he describes as a high tech lynching during the whole Anita Hill controversy. And I think with this, like, I don't know, you mentioned again, like his ideas about black manhood. And look, like his, the project of marrying like Milton Friedman to like black separatism is like, okay, like that's for you all laid out, but his views probably his longest landing, longest lasting legacy, at this point will be the dobs decision and the curtailment of women's rights in this country. Where does his views on like women in gender and like sexuality? Like how are those are related? Yeah. You know, it's interesting because you brought up a Anita Hill. And you know, I say in the book, it's, you know, it's obvious to everybody who's really investigated it that Thomas committed perjury and was guilty of everything that Anita Hill said. And at the same time, what's also true, I think, to anybody who knows anything about Thomas is that in a weird way, when he said that comment about the high tech lynching, that was, that was a, a very truthful moment for him. It was a kind of moment that he had been preparing for for most of his adult life, not because he knew that he was going to be caught out by Anita Hill, because in his story of, you know, the black community and black nationalism, you know, there's the power of black men. And then there has always been the sort of the treachery and the, at best, the weakness of black women and at worst, the treachery of black women. One of the things that Thomas becomes famous, what puts Thomas on the map in the first place is this interview he did in 1980 with Juan Williams, or part of a profile, and where he says he had gone to the Fairmont conference, which was this big sort of launching point for black conservative, it wasn't just black conservatives. In fact, at the Fairmont conference was this conference in San Francisco at the Fairmont Hotel, Charles Hamilton, who was the co-author, the Stokely Carmichael of Black Power was there. So it was a slightly more heterodox but, you know, gathering. But Juan Williams, you know, interviews, Thomas, and Thomas makes this incredibly ugly comment about his sister, and he says, you know, she's so dependent on welfare that she gets mad when the mailman is late with the check. And this, you know, kind of set off wildfire, and he ultimately had to apologize for it. But he tells you his sister or just the public at large. The public at large. Yeah, no, I don't think he ever apologized to his sister about that. I mean, you know, so, you know, he says, you know, he's a total snake in a lot of ways, but he has always had this view. And it really is a romance because the actual story of men and women in his life is like a lot more complicated. And his sister ends up being the kind of, you know, holds up the whole family back in pinpoint and is working three jobs, you know, to kind of keep things together, taking care of elders in the family and young people and so far. But setting that the reality aside, you know, he's always viewed Black women as kind of really at the bottom of the totem pole. And women in general, he does not have, you know, a particularly positive view of them. And so what's interesting about the Dobs decision, and I would actually go back a couple of years before that, I can't, oh, I think it's, I can't remember the name of the case, but it was in like 2020, 2021. Or no, a 2019, excuse me, he sets out his longest opinion on abortion. And what he says very clearly in that opinion, I think it's box versus plan parenthood of something or other is that he reaches back into the archive of Margaret Sanger and sort of the kind of fraternization between birth control advocates and eugenics and really develops this whole account that abortion and birth control have essentially been a kind of plot of the white community to destroy Black people. And he quotes from N. double ACP statements in the 1960s about the dangers of birth control and Harlem and so forth and how it's being used to kind of restrict the back population. So, you know, for him abortion, it has very little to do with, you know, women's rights about which he doesn't really think very highly in the first place. But but secondarily, abortion is really once more what it represents is the agency of white liberals who are, you know, extending their tentacles into the Black community. And, you know, we can go off further with this. But I mean, I would say that basically that's his point of view on the question of women's rights and abortion. Well, you know, like bring up the Margaret Sanger thing so quickly, I mean, it brings someone, your other book, The Reaction Already Mind, where like this one is always stuck with me from that is that like the conservative ideology or reactionary ideology, it's not really like an ideology as such. It's a series of improvisations. It's like a yes and routine to just keep dealing with like an increasingly democratic society. Are these like, is the eugenics thing? Is that another improvisation by Thomas to like to say something about it? Or is this, or is this coming from someplace real? Or I think that is more of an improvisation. I think it's a fair point because most of his previous abortion opinions were pretty just boilerplate Republican party, you know, stopped. There was nothing interesting there that I could find that in any way distinguished anything. So I do think that was definitely a kind of improvisation that, you know, unfortunately, has had quite a bit of influence. I mean, the second he put that into the opinion, you then see lower courts, conservatives on lower courts start referencing that opinion. And there is this kind of feedback loop between, you know, Federalist society people, lower court judges, Thomas's own clerks, many of whom go on to become judges. And so it is a bit of a network. And I think with that one in particular, I think it's definitely, you know, pretty tactical. And I don't put much stock into it. It's also great trolling. I mean, you liberals, you love, you say you love black people, but you also are in favor of making sure there are way fewer of them than there would otherwise be. What's up with that? Yes. Yeah. And, you know, this has always been, you know, the line between trolling and sort of jurisprudence with Thomas is a fine one. And you see a lot of this. I mean, you know, we haven't even gotten into the issue of gun rights. I mean, you know, his whole story on gun rights is, you know, lifted straight from Eric Froner and Eric Herbert Aptheker for, you know, and for people who don't know that he was, remember the Communist Party was the Pininger and Historian of slave revolts. You know, Thomas's footnotes are just laden with these references going back to the 19th century and slavery and abolition and reconstruction on the centrality of arms for black men. So again, you know, a troll or jurisprudence, I leave that to the lawyers to sort of call that one. Well, whether it's the Margaret Sanger thing or bringing up like the importance of firearms and like black liberation struggles. And like, what's fascinating, like the overall as you described it, his kind of, I suppose the term now would be Afro-Pessimism or racial pessimism that like, you know, the white people are fundamentally racist and the Americans are fundamentally racist country and that nothing is ever going to change that. The interesting thing is like that point of view is very much invoked these days and like sort of, you can see for obvious reasons, you look around and you're like, well, shit, like why is everything still so bad? But like that idea, it's just, it's, it's, there are uses for that in like a left-wing sensibility, but it's also very useful to the overall right wing project as well, depending on how you, which way you shade it. If like, if your project is greater racial hierarchy and the separatism. Right. And, you know, the way I think about this, there was a great book that came out 30 years ago now called The Rhetoric of Reaction by Albert Hirschman, who was a economist and political scientist. And he, he said there's basically three tropes or three ways of thinking about reactionary argument. One is perversity. And that is, whatever you're trying to do, you're going to produce, in fact, the opposite result. You're going to make the very problem you're trying to solve worse. So you try to solve poverty, you make poverty worse. That's perversity. The second trope is jeopardy. Whatever you try to do, you may succeed in it, but you're going to jeopardize some other value that you hold. So let's say you, you, you start off on my favor of freedom and equality, you end up pushing for equality, but you restrict freedom. So that's the, the jeopardy trope in right-wing reactionary thought. The third trope was what he called futility. And this is the argument that, you know, whereas the first two tropes acknowledge that you're doing something, you're achieving something, it may be perverser, it may be jeopardizing, but you're doing something. The futility argument on the right says, no matter what you do, you're never going to, you're, it's absolutely futile. You're never going to achieve anything along the lines of what you think or along any lines. And what, in Persian says two things about that, what the futilitarian argument. One is, is that it is the most dangerous and insidious of right-wing arguments. It's not, because it's the most deflating deflationary argument. And second, he says, part of what makes it so insidious and dangerous is that it has a weird way of mimicking left-wing structural arguments. Anybody who's been on the left in any kind of activist movement or whatever knows that there's always that person who stands up and says, oh, all of you guys are ridiculous. You know, if you're in the labor movement or whatever, because capitalism is this kind of deep structural force that cannot be overcome through these kind of, you know, mechanisms that you're trying to engage in. And I see, um, Thomas is, I see Thomas's Afro-Pesimism very much in that light of the futilitarianism. And there's a reason why I brought it up in the book. It's not to say that, you know, Thomas is like Afro-Pesimists on the left and all the rest of it, but to say that that kind of argument has a history on the right. And it's not just about race. It's about a whole bunch of things, having to do with, you know, political efforts at redistribution and all the rest of it. And that, you know, the kind of, the most, the most poisonous thinkers on the right have been able to inject their poison because there's a kind of superficial similarity and sometimes not so superficial similarity with certain left-wing tropes. And it particularly, I think, at moments of, like, sort of defeat and extended defeat, which is, I think, where we've been for quite some time in this country. Yeah, it's only attractive argument because it seems correct. Yeah, it makes sense of your defeat. And it almost gives it a kind of theological gloss. So, you know, Matt Karp wrote this very great article in Harper's about a year ago, about the 1619 project. And he said, you know, the thing that recurs the metaphors are, this is part of the nation's DNA or it's part of its original sin, racism. And, you know, that's partially, you know, you could say that's just rhetorical and all the rest of it. But it does, like I said, it does apply a kind of, you know, deep sense of fatalism that makes the idea, you know, the idea of political politics seem kind of, you know, silly. And, you know, I think there's a certain kind of activist who will say, well, you know, we're going to lose, but we should still go down fighting kind of a thing. You know, and that's fine for the activists, but you know, you're not going to get, you don't get people to kind of make great sacrifices of the sort that the left is always dependent upon for the sake of, you know, sort of suicide and, and, and, and defeat and failure. Like failure is not an attractive political slogan. And so I do, I do think there's, you know, there's stuff in Thomas, and I should say, Thomas came to that fatalism in sense of pessimism to defeat before he shifted to the right. You know, and so what role that played in his shift to the right is an open question. Well, because it's just, it's very, it's very seductive because it offers you really a out on any moral responsibility for anything. Like if you could definitely see in Thomas's trajectory, like coming to a moment of like, oh, this is, this is never going to change. So this here is a path for success, a renown, all the stuff that I can take. And yes, it's, you know, it means being a right-winger, but it's also, it means abandoning like the hope for the stuff, but that stuff was never going to happen. And what I can claim instead to like feel that there's some nobility here is like the sense that I am honest in a way that others aren't. Like, yes. And that like me taking a bunch of money from this psycho hillbilly and smoking cigarettes on a cigar, so that is more virtuous because it is more honest than somebody going in front of the NAACP and say vote for Democrats a few more times and we're going to get some justice in this country. Yeah, I mean, one of the early things that sort of made me interested in Thomas was exactly what you're picking up on. And I called it kind of racial candor that there's a kind of appeal to him. And, you know, being honest and clear-eyed, which again, I think anybody who's been on the left knows very well the type of person who, you know, really prides themselves on being candid and clear-eyed. And, you know, without any illusion whatsoever about the nature of things. And, you know, there is a kind of you know, path to, I don't want to use the word cynicism because, you know, I'm a pretty cynical person myself and there's nothing really wrong with it. But there's a kind of corrosive cynicism, I guess I would say, at the heart of that. That I think it's far more like widespread cultural appeal than people realize. I mean, one of the things that was really interesting in talking about the book with different audiences, I would have a lot of people come up to me afterwards who were black and they would say, you know, you're talking about my father, you're talking about my grandfather. It's always men they're talking about. But, you know, this is a very widespread view. It definitely necessarily result in people voting Republican by any stretch. But that sense that, like don't talk to me about mass protest and don't talk to me about that kind of, I don't want to hear it. Like that's just a path to defeat. I think much more widespread than people want to acknowledge. And I just want to add one other thing to that because Matt, you brought up about, you know, it sort of lets him morally off the hook, which I think is true. I think the flip side though is that it also creates a kind of very weirdly moralistic politics on the left that says, you know, do this not because you're going to win because we know we're not going to win, but do it because it's right. And again, I think that's a oftentimes a very weak position. I just finished teaching this term. And the last book we read was W. V. Du Bois's Black Reconstruction. And he makes a big deal of pointing out that the, you know, the real leaders of black emancipation, Republican party, Charles Sumner and Fadius Stevens, they had such contempt for that kind of empty moralism. And Sumner says, you know, never depend, if you're depending upon the sense of justice in people, for your program, you've already lost, you know, I much more have faith in people sense of necessity and interest and, you know, the sort of reality principle in a broader, you know, in a broader sense than I would in that sort of pure moralism. So if there's a weird convergence between, you know, as you say, sort of him getting out of the moral responsibility on his side, but then the left sort of converging on this very moralistic acts in any sense of rail politic also. I guess that case is to the current moment with Thomas in which his relationship and with Harlan Crow, the billionaire and the many vacations they've taken together, has put him really back in the spotlight. And I was wondering, when this story broke, people were sharing a video that Thomas, or it was sort of a hazeographic video promoting Thomas, Thomas Thomas, in which he was talking about how he only likes to travel in America, and he only likes to travel by RV, obviously in contrast with, you know, like a Johnstoo, a, you know, Icelandic volcano or whatever. I prefer the RV parks. I prefer the Walmart parking lots to the beaches and things like that. But there's something normal to me about it. I've come from regular stock. But he says, I'm from normal stock. And I'm just one of you saw that and just that phrase, I'm from normal stock. That just stuck with me so so much about Thomas saying, I'm normal. What can one say? I mean, you know, that story about traveling in the RVs. And I can't remember in that video if he says this or not, but in I think it's in his book or in his memoir, he talks about RV and they would park in and parking lots for Walmart. And that was where he and Ginny would stay, as they traveled across America from, you know, Island to Island of Walmart. And that's how they saw the real America. And the one, you know, almost it sort of feels a little silly. It's like it's such an old trope in American politics of, you know, the common man who, you know, Reagan totally did this all the time. And you know, George W. Bush also did this, you know, like, you know, where it was the sort of whole affectation of wearing jeans. You know, Reagan was sort of, clearing brush, you know, was a rancher. And of course, you know, everything with Reagan was paid by his corporate benefactors. And I mean, his whole lifestyle, we now know, down to his, you know, ranch was bought by his corporate benefactor. So it's a kind of old story on the right. And I don't, there's a way in which we can sort of make too much of a fetish of Clarence Thomas. And, you know, I mean, I have no problem with people pointing out the hypocrisy of it all because it's totally true. I guess I would just say it's a pretty standard right wing story. But as it comes to, as it relates to Harlan Crowe, and I think like I read you on this, trying to call this out as like hypocrisy or corruption, at least those are regards to Thomas only goes so far because, as I think I hope we've explicated so far, this kind of corruption is not corruption as such to him. This is the benefits of being a democratically engaged citizen in America. And you said like, you know, through economic freedom, black people can have these little niches of freedom and autonomy. Well, he has quite a significant niche of freedom and autonomy for himself. But like his friendship with Harlan Crowe and like all the benefits that he's accrued as a result of that, in terms of vacations or hit memorabilia or whatever he's betting. Like no, like this is this is a totally ethical invocation of your rights as a democratic citizen. Yeah. And this, you know, this goes way back. And, you know, just in 1987, Thomas gives this speech at the Pacific Research Institute, which is a liberitarian think tank outfit out in San Francisco. And he sort of lays out this vision, you know, of the problem with the New Deal liberal. And I, you know, when I say that, I just, you know, want people because people hear liberal and they think Bill Clinton and people, you know, Hillary Clinton and so forth. But a class Thomas is really talking about people like John Kenneth Galbraith, the economist, the great, you know, liberal left economist, FDR and so forth. And he says, the problem with those guys, the New Deal liberal is they really have contempt, like deep-seated contempt for men who make money. They think it's crass, they think it's vulgar, they think it's materialistic and so on and so forth. And he says, you know, the people who they really value those liberals are the, what he called the idealistic professions. And by that, he meant journalists, lawyers and professors. And these are all people who engage in speech, is their fundamental activity. And that's how they make, you know, they make their living as by speech. And he lays out there and he does two things. So what's interesting is the first, it's really a sense of culture war, which we've really forgotten when we use that term culture war. But the original culture war for the right was about this whole question of money. And like, do you value men who make money, the businessman or you value professors and journalists and the egg head. The pencil, the, exactly the egg heads, right? Go ahead. The people who got in make and create, you know, change the world. Exactly. And that was really, you know, it was obviously a whole economic battle and a political battle, but it was also a cultural battle, you know, like, and that was the project of the right was to rehabilitate those men of money to show that these were virtuous men who, you know, made America and made it great. And so on and so forth. You do mention that Clarence Thomas opens every term of the Supreme Court, or every like with screening of the fountain head that all his clerks have required to attend. Exactly. Exactly. And so, you know, there, there you've, you've got that sort of moral rehabilitation of the of the man of money. But, but, you know, taking that from the sphere of political ideology to constitutionalism, when he sets out in this speech is something that has since become really important for the right wing court. And that is we have to figure out a way to make money making have as a sacred a status in the constitutional pantheon as does speech free speech in the first amendment. And so what he's, what he sets out there and what other conservatives have done with them is to say that money making and the world of money is an expressive world of speech. And now we get into the sphere of campaign finance so that when you make a contribution, or, first of all, when a campaign spends money, so when Bernie Sanders, you know, spends money to have a rally or to get its message out, that's a form of speech. And if you were to prohibit Sanders the campaign from spending money, you would be prohibiting his speech from getting out. And then Thomas takes it a second step and says, the contributors to those campaigns, you know, so I'm sure you guys may have contributed money to the Sanders campaign when you were doing that, you were exercising your speech rights. And so that he extends that argument to say that, okay, so when a citizen, a private citizen, donate money to a campaign, he is, or she is expressing their belief and their desire to get this message out. And so you say, well, hold on a second, we have an extremely unequal country. There are a lot of wealthy people. If they're contributing to a campaign, more money than, you know, you or I are contributing, they're going to have more access. They're going to have more influence. And the thing about Thomas is he says, yeah, that's right. They will. And that is what you call influence peddling, what you call corruption is basically is democracy and action. This is people, citizens exercising their influence. And so now we, you know, leap forward 30 years to this whole Harlan Crow thing. And, you know, again, what's so kind of fascinating is that all you had to, I mean, I don't want to say I knew about the Harlan Crow other issues of gifts and so forth have been reported in the past. It just does go way back. The LA Times was on this story during the odds. It's been well known. But I certainly didn't know the extent of the gifts or anything like that. But what's interesting is you go back to those his opinions and his speeches and he's kind of laid the whole thing out for you right there and then. This is his conception of what a democracy is all about. Is rich men amassing wealth and influencing the political sphere? And once again, you have that you have that distinction with liberalism, which claims, you know, we have a society geared around money and geared around accumulation and allows for this vast accumulation. But that doesn't mean you have more rights to X, Y, or Z. Now that that's an incoherence that that the right is able to cut through. And like that's another one of those, yeah, those astringent like reality things that they get to stand on is like we are at least acknowledging what the actual reality of a capitalist society is. Yes, brights a crew at the top like the money does. There's for all synonyms for one another. And if I could push that one step further, you know, this whole idea about money is speech, which a lot of people who are liberals and on the left sort of heard for the first time with citizens united. And so for many people, that whole idea is something that John Roberts came up with and concocted. The irony of that position is if you go back to the original campaign finance decision from 1975, which is Buckley V. Belayow, that was a, it was a, a majority of the practically unanimous decision. The whole premise that money is speech is accepted as the foundation of that decision, which most people think was, well, there's some argument about who authored it, but it was certainly signed on to by William Brennan and Thurgood Marshall, who were the sort of liberal tightens of the court. And so the principle that money is speech on the one hand was accepted in that decision, but, and this is the kicker, what was very much rejected by the court was that you could therefore limit the role of money and politics for the sake of equalizing speech. In other words, you accept the premise that money is speech, but you cannot, in the name of the First Amendment, try to equalize the speech by basically saying everybody has to spend the same amount. And that doesn't even touch on the larger point you're getting at, which is about the inequality of the society as a whole. So there's a whole complicated role that liberals had played in this, in this firmament that just simply did not begin with John Roberts and the citizens of the United case. What do you make of the idea that like the corruption between Holland, Krohn, and Clarence Thomas, like a lot of people on the right dismissed it as this kind of like, oh, do you really think he's changing his vote or some kind of like straight up quid pro quo? But what do you make of the idea that I believe I read from you that Clarence Thomas has said in public statements, you know, I could be making a lot more money in the private sector. So think of me, think of that the next time you're planning a vacation to New Zealand, because I could potentially retire while Biden is president. I mean, I actually didn't know that he had said that, but I mean, I have to say on this one, I think if you're trying to look for a smoking gun, which people did have tried to look on some of his decisions like that it was a clear quid pro quo. I mean, A, I think you're not going to find it and B, the irony of looking for a quid pro quo like that is that Thomas and the conservatives will actually be the ones who say that unless you can find a quid pro quo that's essentially the equivalent of a bride, there is no corruption. And so I think it's a kind of wrong headed way to go about it. I mean, I think the bigger corruption, if you will, is, you know, it's just the general shift on the court to the right, which, you know, big money certainly had a huge role to play in. I mean, they've created, you know, not just in the obvious ways, but they created this whole intellectual infrastructure. Thomas has been the beneficiary of this. He's been a part of this for a long time. I just, I guess my general point of view is that there's kind of like a sincerity that's on, which is that if you can prove the providence of an opinion is pure thought somehow or another, you've exonerated that opinion from all of its problems. And, you know, to me, Thomas is an ideologue. He doesn't need to be paid for his opinions. I mean, I'm sure he just used this as kind of extra, but that doesn't in any way save those opinions from what's wrong with them. And I, you know, I just, I think, you know, the left just has this problem of looking for smoking guns. It just reminds me now that you brought it up of like during the Trump, you know, administration, like, oh, we're going to prove that he, you know, Russia was this and, you know, we've got some special prosecutor who's going to really save us and, you know, we're on Russia watch every night. And, you know, it's just, it's not the way these people are going to be defeated. And likewise, Thomas, like Thomas has problems and everything that's wrong with him begins so long before you see this big money pouring into him. And I should say the big money pours into him because he's, you know, he's already paved the way for it. Like the causality runs the other direction. Well, that's because liberal, I mean, liberals are, are, you know, always going to end up grasping for procedural gotchas and violations of, uh, structures laws and norms because they can't have an ideological conflict because at fundamental levels, they agree with the premises of a conservatism when it comes to the academic distribution. And they have no interest in seeing those interrogated. And so they really can't go any deeper than procedural violations to try to, to, uh, neutralize their opponents. And not to mention, you know, I think up, I think this is actually beginning to change and I'm glad to see it. But up until very recently, virtually every liberal was committed to the whole sanctity of the Supreme Court and the halo around the Supreme Court. And so, you know, Thomas, in this sense, has always been this weird thorn in their, you know, in their minds, you know, because of the way he got on the court because of a need of hell because he didn't, you know, come up the path that most justices have in recent years come up. And so it's, it's, it's not just, I think you're right about the proceduralism, but I also think there's been this kind of that court fetishism that has really been a millstone around the way liberals have thought about this stuff. I think that at least has begun to change a bit. I know we've just been canceled not to look for a smoking gun. So I'll really direct your attention to one that is perhaps loaded, which to be talking about corruption and clearance, Thomas, I mean, to me, like the most obvious one would be his relationship to his wife, Ginny Thomas, who is a bit of a, she's a bit of a screwball. She's got, she's a little, just things a little bit different, but you know, like her advocacy for political groups that had business in front of the court that he never disclosed. But I guess I'm just more interested in Ginny Thomas and clearance, like their relationship. What do you, what do you, what do we know of their marriage? You're like, what did you come across about their relationship in your writing of this book? I mean, I kind of be honest, I sort of stayed away from it. You know, I, I tried to kind do a little bit of research on it. And I didn't, I didn't find much that was all that interesting beyond pointing out the obvious that, you know, this is somebody who up until the day he met Ginny Thomas, fought an interracial relationships and interracial, you know, dating was wrong. And then he meets her and, you know, he obviously changes point of view on that. And so, so I didn't, you know, really look into it too much. I think there's actually a person who's writing about it. For New York Magazine, who I, I hope will come up with something that was, will be a little bit more illuminating than the facts of what we already know about Ginny Thomas. You know, I, yeah, I'll just leave it at that. I don't think I really have much to add to it. I do, I kind of think that he just, when she starts talking about, you know, the two hundred mules and the soros, I think he's just like, he's like loving it. It's just like, look at this crazy, like, he's got a metal stick in the thing and he's just like tapping the glass, like, look, this is what they're like. Look at this, I can learn a person. Let's get at the RV. Tell me, tell me more about the illuminati. This is, this is my wife's argument as well. And it could very well be true. I mean, I just, I don't have it. I just have no special insight into the question at all. Like this. Okay. So it's around things out here. Okay, 2023, Florence Thomas is the oldest Supreme Court justice. Was that correct? Yeah. No, he's like the oldest. He's the longest serving. He's the oldest. So, you know, there's always still the possibility he could just die, which is, you know, not out side the realm of possibilities. But the justices that have came after and particularly the three that were appointed under Trump. And if you want to talk about corruption, how about just the fact that a guy who didn't win the popular vote got to a point three Supreme Court justices that are going to be alive for a generation at least. Like, so there's a question of like, what do we do about this? Because like, whether Thomas is on the court or not, like, it's pretty much set. And that condition is, in my opinion, intolerable for any human being currently alive in this country. You mentioned that the beginning of a crack up of the sanctity of the courts as an institution among liberals. But I don't know. I mean, just your thoughts on like, because you know, it's a question that people bang their head ape against all the time. What are we going to do about the Supreme Court? Are we going to impeach injustice, stack the court, get rid of judicial review? I mean, where is this all going? Yeah, it's a good question. And, you know, I would add, in addition to the three, you know, George W. Bush, of course, even though he appointed both of his justices when he'd been reelected, the first time around, he of course didn't win the popular vote also. And that's how he got into office. And I mean, I think it's a really important point, you know, to stress. You know, I deal, I'm not a political operative or strategist. But, you know, the Supreme Court has always been, you know, it's always had this very weird status in American politics, because it has so much power. And yet, it's been this counter-majoritarian institution. And, you know, people spent 50 years trying to make sense of that contradiction. How in the democracy can you have a institution that has so much power? But now we have this situation, as you pointed out, where it's, you know, at least in the past, you could say these, you know, these justices were appointed by presidents who had been elected with the popular vote. And, you know, the kind of mallop portionment in the Senate wasn't nearly to the degree that it is today among small states versus big states. Where it's all going, though, I don't know. I mean, I do think, I mean, to me, the most, the most promising, frankly, is the idea of, you know, the court stripping, I mean, sorry, Congress stripping the court of certain kinds of jurisdiction. I mean, I think it's a totally democratic argument. And I think it's one that the left, you know, really should take on. I think liberals should take it on. But, you know, you're, I don't think anybody really has the answer to it. To how to go about doing this. But, you know, I will say, I mean, a couple of things, you know, the United States is faced a stack Supreme Court before. And what's interesting is that, you know, FDR in 1935, and I don't like to come and get into the romance of the New Deal because there is a lot of romance around this. But, you know, the Supreme Court struck down, you know, item after item after item of the New Deal culminating in 1935 in the Shackdew decision. And, you know, FDR, you know, God bless, you know, hell's the press conference. And he just starts walking people through, you know, in this very kind of engaging popular way, like everything that's wrong without the Supreme Court thinks about this. And there used to be a tradition in this country that like, you know, for all the constitutions problems that this is like a document for people. It's not a document for people who went to fucking, you know, Harvard Law School or Yale Law School. This is a document that ordinary people get to interpret and, you know, all the things that we attribute, you know, 13th Amendment, the 14th, like those were things that came out of the political sphere. They didn't come from Supreme Court justices. And so, you know, that doesn't really answer your question, you know, what are we going to do about it? But I think to the extent that we can sort of get back to some of these, you know, ideas of popular constitutionalism and rest the document. And the, you know, out of the hands of the Supreme Court is all the better. And, you know, I think there are people on the left who are trying to develop arguments in that regard, whether they achieve any traction politically or not, I don't, you know, for the hell knows. But I don't see any other way around it, you know, except to kind of go through it like that. But at least to begin to like begin to remove from the popular conscious, this the idea of the law and the constitution is this kind of like secret document. It's like a bover approach or political just politics in general. Yeah, you know, and to that to that issue, I was part of this NPR documentary on Thomas. And when it was very interesting, it opens up the season opens up with the host going to Constitution Day at a Denver public school high school. And what's, you know, I don't know what it was. I mean, I'm sure if you had things like that in your high school, you know, everybody there back in, you know, when I was in high school, would be talking about the Supreme Court and I'd say the sanctity of the Constitution. And all these high school students were like, what are you talking about? The Constitution is this completely crap document interpreted by this institution that's totally corrupt. And, and these are people who are like the debate champions and, you know, sort of constitution day type champions. They weren't the cigarette smoking kids. These are the high achievers. Yeah, these are these are the grinds, you know, and I thought the truth of the matter is is that that was once again the sort of the trick, you know, if you were an up and comer in the 1910th, the 1920s and 1930s, even if you went to places like Harvard Law School, that would be the kind of educate you would be taught that the laws of political weapon. And the only question is who wields it and how? And, you know, that's where people like, you know, Justice Frankfurt or Felix Frankfurt, came out of that tradition. And so to me, it's not inconceivable, you know, that that was the United States. That wasn't, you know, some kind of Utrei, you know, European formation. So, you know, I don't see why it would be impossible on, you know, to have something like that again. All right, we'll, we'll leave it there for today. Professor Corey Robbins, the author of the Enigma of Clarence Thomas and the reactionary mind, both very good books available in bookstores everywhere. Corey, thank you so much for your time. Take your plates to back status, back status, all you fellas who have some more, and you're in the care. Yeah, yeah, yeah, then it's all, the fellas will better be when again.",

      "text": "Henry the sheepdog and the Wolf of Mossville, a children's book about fake news by Lauren Southerne. Not much happens in Mossville, perhaps the odd spat between Patricia the Pig or Karen the Porcupine would occur at the knitting club, or Terry the Turtle would bring up some deep dissatisfactions about the distribution of acorns at the council meetings. It was a quiet place and the village certainly had never seen a dog before. It was all the chatter that week. Tom the Hare, local reporter for the morning Mossville, was in a hard spot. The hamster herald was taking off and he'd always been in close competition with both the beaver buzz and the raccoon review. He needed a scoop desperately. What better idea than to get a glimpse of the new dog visitor? The story would go wild. Back at Mossville, Tom the Hare was furiously riding at his typewriter. Pages flew about the room. This will be the story of a lifetime thought Tom. New visitor, a wolf in sheep's clothing, the headline read, with a big picture of Henry the sheep dog on the front bearing his fangs. Tom the Hare began printing hundreds of copies. Then he rushed them to each shop and put sacks on doorways, in windows, and everywhere he could reach. The story began to spread like wildfire. Everyone in the village was desperate to get a copy of the morning Mossville report. The hamsters were horrified. The squirrels were shocked. The foxes were frightened. The possums were petrified. A wolf in Mossville, well I never yelled Terry the turtle, nearly dropping his lettuce while gawking at the morning paper. The next day, Terry the turtle arrived bright and early outside Basil's burrow with a loudspeaker which he used to make speeches on the dangers of wolves. Other animals carried hand-painted signs, reading, no wolves in our town. Some animals didn't even bother painting signs, but just threw paint at Basil's burrow, making a terrible mess. And over at all, Terry kept shouting, come out, come out wolf, we don't want you in our town. Terry had a guard of other animals standing around him, wearing badges that said anti-wolf. The next day, Terry the turtle arrived, in the village, in the village, in the village, in the town. The foxes were surprised to see the fire and the fire. The foxes were surprised to see the fire and the fire. Hi everybody, welcome back to memes and politics. I hope you are ready to rot your brain with right wing conspiracies tonight. I've grown a bit used to it, so I've built up a tolerance. I'm sitting now on the floor of our new apartment back in New York. I probably sound a little bit different. We have almost no furniture, but plenty of cardboard boxes. I think this will be a little bit more of a casual stream. So we're going to talk, we're going to riff for an hour. Good to see you, Talia. Good to see you, stock human in the chat. Where to begin for this month? There are just simply so many stories to track. Straight out of the chart of truth, there was a metallic monolith found in remote Utah. I'm sure you've seen this going around. People are not sure whether it's art or it's a hoax for those of us in the art world. This looks a lot like a John McCracken piece, who's a canonized artist, shows its Werner. The gallery seems to deny it, but his family, specifically his son, said that this was something that he had hinted at in his practice a while ago. Pay for ease in the chat says that it's art. Do you mean it's art just in general? It's like a work of art or like it's confirmed it's a John McCracken piece now. Because it seemed like he used to live in New Mexico, I guess somewhere that's not too far away. Blame is saying it's got rivets. Yes, I noticed that there was, there's weld marks. What I thought were initially screw heads on the back of it. Pay for ease says, oh, just in general. Yeah, yeah, happening upon this strange, unexplainable thing. It doesn't look up to snuff. It doesn't have the finished fetish and all of the high-end fancy mirrored finish that a regular McCracken piece would have. I did. Okay, so there was a piece in the Times. This quote certainly caught my eye. Did John McCracken make that monolith in Utah? And they've got a side by side of the two, one photograph of the monolith, another photograph of a McCracken piece. I think this is in the Whitney. I'm not sure is that where it is. No, it's downstairs at Werner. Okay, fancy, fancy blue chip gallery. Yeah, yeah. So where is this quote? They describe as sculptures as otherworldly. John McCracken's son is a photographer who lives in San Francisco and he gave this quote to the Times. He wasn't your average sort of dad. He believed in advanced alien races that were able to visit Earth. To his mind, these aliens had been visiting Earth for a long time and they were not malevolent. They wanted to help humanity get past this time of our evolution where all we do is fight each other. I didn't realize that McCracken was like a, does everybody else know this? And I don't know it. McCracken Passatism confirmed. Yeah, yeah. McCrackenist Passatism. I didn't realize it. I mean, I feel like ever since we started the chart of truth, we just uncover more and more deeper, deeper, crazy, or conspiracies. And it's like super mainstream, you know? McCracken is blue chip, canonized artist showing at, I don't know, what would you say is Werner is? Like the third biggest gallery in the world, billions upon billions of revenue. I mean, they're pretty, you know, easily recognizable sculptures. They're like shiny rectangular monoliths. But supposedly he had mentioned one of the things he would like to do within his lifetime was to place his art where people would happen upon it by accident. That seems to be what happened here. He was making them in the 60s when all the alien stuff began popping off. Yeah, yeah, that could work. I mean, you know, who's to say just looking at the side by side of these two pieces? Let's say, for example, John McCracken has an unfinished sculpture in his studio and he's like, well, where do I put it? Yeah, I should just drop it in the middle of the desert. Why not? Why not? Chart of truth continues. Okay, quick update on our ongoing bread tube survey. We are now almost at the end of the alphabetized list on breadtube.tv. Do send us stuff. I think we're going to continue this survey for a few weeks now. If we're not seeing in the feed somewhere, do send it our way. I've got a running list of a few suggestions sent in from people that we'll get to. Novara is doing an AMA tonight because they just hit 100k subs on YouTube. I guess the pandemic has been good for left media, right? Let's dive into our main story this week. So I was trying to track for a special election coverage episode all of the various crazy theories that have been going on. Today, even Trump is still tweeting about how the election has been stolen from him. A lot of those tweets have been censored to some degree or another by Twitter. So we are really hitting some kind of inflection point now where Twitter is supplanting the government as the arbiter of truth. An interesting thing that we've been awaiting for a little while. We'll try and go through these in order. The first major attempt at holding water for the failing presidential bid was rampant voter fraud. And there are a few videos online. I'm sure I can't show this on the stream actually. People burning ballots, people destroying ballots. You gotta do what you gotta do. Fuck Trump. Got around 80. Some of them seem to be credible in that they were indeed a real video, but they were not actual ballots being destroyed. They were prototype ballots or proxy ballots. This also started a competition of people producing phony ballot destruction videos. Let's pull up this first one. This is from Reuters here. This is pretty good. This got, I mean, this is the stakes are actually pretty high. So I can't really give an endorsement to this, but it's pretty funny. He's just like some shithead kid who made a phony video of people destroying ballots. And later he comments on his Facebook. So I did this video in my Amazon outfit because y'all know I'm always joking and it's getting crazy views. So when do I move to Hollywood? Ha ha ha. We're at the boat balance, which means we get your votes and we separate. So if some of these votes happen to say like this one, Donald J. Dunn Trump. Trump. That one just gonna make it worse than me. Second major thread that was pushed by a lot of the right wing media, a lot of these right wing accounts was a big surge of dead voters, which doesn't seem to have panned out either. The third and final meme that was given a major push in the last few weeks was the fraud jump meme. In Michigan and in Wisconsin, as the votes are being tallied, you've probably seen this depicted as two overarching lines, blue and red, and then blue towards the very end as both curves are plateauing unexpectedly jumps up. So around 3 a.m. and 4 a.m. in Michigan and Wisconsin, there were a huge increase of 100,000 plus votes for Biden. This circulated for a few days. It didn't really seem to stick as well because there are a dozen counties where based on how they count the votes and what districts come in at what time, the tallies do tend to jump in favor of one candidate or another. They're counting, say, for example, a metropolitan area versus a rural area and so on. But the fraud jump meme, that one pretty quickly exhausted itself. The major narrative that seems to have stuck and has now become the dominant trend also because it was pushed significantly by Trump himself was that dominion, the voting machines and the software that is used in some counties, but not all, is in some way rigged for a variety of various reasons. And the claims have been shifting significantly over time. They've tried a few of them. Part of it says that the pieces were made in China and that China has been influencing the vote. One of the theories says that the data goes overseas, but it really seems like they tried out a few different options. And to one degree or another, this is where they've all landed. So I tried to take a tally of all of the channels or all of the influencers that were pushing this dominion is rigged narrative. And eventually I just couldn't keep track because it was pretty much across the board. They're all towing the party line. But I'll just run down my list here quickly to show you how extensive it is. I have RUSH here. His bit was quite funny. Actually, he said that the reason some of the recounts took so long is because Trump won by an overwhelming margin. He won by millions upon millions. And the Democrats had to spend four days printing additional fake ballots. It's pretty good. So we've got RUSH, Ashley St. Clair, Dan Bongino, Scott Pressler, John Miller, Bronze Age pervert, Candace Owens, Nick Fuentes, Jaden McNeil, Scott Adams, Stephen Crowder, Charlie Kirk, Glenn Beck, Lauren Southern, etc. So it was pretty much all across the board from far right to mainstream, from social media to news anchor, what have you. The grifter list. Yeah, yeah, thank you, Tally. That's a good name for it. Exactly. So after trying out all the variables, this is the one that stuck. And I think it's the one that stuck because it gives you the most directions in which to point fingers. I've tried to go down some of those rabbit holes to bring back some tiny nugget of truth. I have been mostly unsuccessful, but let's try and go through some of those stories and see what we turn up. So the infamous tweet from Trump claims that 2.7 million votes were deleted and thousands were switched. I ran down that story, trying to check and do my due diligence for the links and whatnot. I want to give a shout out to Ali Brelland, friend of the stream, journalist at Mother Jones. He had some great coverage on this. Trump is paraphrasing in his tweet, a story from OAN. And OAN is reposting a story from the Gateway Pundit. The Gateway Pundit is reposting what they call unaudited data from an analyst on the Donald.win. And the Donald.win is the forum where all of the refugees from R-slash the Donald have regathered since it was deplatformed on Reddit. So a few months ago when they were kicked off of Reddit, this is normally what happens. The mildly crazy people tend to scatter, the extremely crazy people, all gather on a new forum. And this is something that I have tried to argue for quite a while where every platform migration thins the herd, but those that remain grow more radical than ever. In most cases, this is a very effective way of quarantining, a politically dangerous faction. But usually they're quarantined because the spread of their information is some way cut off in that they don't have immediate access to the mainstream channels. But what seems to be happening here is that they found a clever way of upstreaming the process where this theory that has been posted to the Donald.win is completely unsubstantiated. It's like, it's really just one lunatic guy's theory. Let me show you what this website actually looks like. So this is the, this is the post that makes the original claim from the Donald.win. And you can kind of see already these are mostly the ravings of a lunatic with the number, the amount of capital letters and everything else here. But this creates the plausible deniability that the gateway pundit can reference this and OAN can reference the gateway pundit and Trump can reference OAN. And it creates this constant chain of deferral where the person at the bottom of this easily elunatic with all of those alarm emojis. But everyone can kind of say, you know, this is unaudited data. It's from a private analyst. We don't know if it's true or not. It certainly doesn't seem like de-platforming this group made them any less influential. Right? Like the point of de-platforming is supposed to protect the political body from the most extreme elements. Clearly, that's not working here because it went from this anonymous poster that we're looking at right now on the screen. This anonymous poster on the Donald.win to the president's Twitter. So, you know, what is de-platforming really doing in this case? Well, it's protecting Reddit. It's protecting Reddit from being responsible for the next crazy person who does something. But it's not actually limiting the reach of quote, quote, dangerous or politically toxic material. So this story gets quite a bit deeper, but let's just look through these really quickly. I want to show, okay, these paste bin. Can we find the JPEGs? Okay. So this is the proof, actually. This is what you're looking at here on the screen. This is, this is supposedly the proof. What happens is that periodically as the machine, the dominion machine is calculating the votes. It spits out these timestamped updates. And you can see here Trump D versus Biden J. That's how they're listed in the system. The total number of votes here is 573,857. The following total is 574,417. But the ratios for Trump and Biden have moved marginally further apart. Meaning the allegation is that votes for Biden in this system somehow secretly are being additionally weighted. In that if you were to walk in and cast a vote for Donald Trump, it would tell your vote as 1.0. And if you were to walk in and cast a vote for Joe Biden, it would tell your vote as 1.1 or something like that. They're saying that there's an additional weight to the Biden votes because, as you can see on the numbers here, the ratios have marginally shifted in a way that is disproportionate to the vote tally. So they've gotten an additional 1,000 people and the 0.005 margin has shifted in favor of Biden, which is disproportionate to the 1,000 votes accumulated in between the two timestamps. Specifically, we're looking at 151.26, 151.52. There's a few of these. So let's just go through them quickly. I wanted to hover on that one so we could look at the pattern, but they seem to plot this throughout a number of different updates. These are the periodic updates that, oh wow, some of these screenshots have been taken down. Okay, so here we've got another one. This is checking 187 and checking 188 and you see a similar thing happen again. Keep in mind, Trump is winning still in all of these status updates, but they're just marginally marginally picking up a bigger percentage for Biden or rather I should say a smaller percentage for Trump. But I went through each of these individually. It's quite a long post. Some of these have been taken down, as you can see. I mean, I'm sure there's been an incredible amount of attention on this, this single post. There's 4,364 comments on it now. It's been updated a few times since makes its way to the gateway pundit, then to OAN, then to Trump. But the stunningly simple explanation for all of this is that these periodic status updates from the Dominion machines are not the actual vote tally. It's just a status update that is rounded to a decimal point. That's all it is. But of course that doesn't stop any of the conspiracies. Dominion of course denies all of this in a press release. This is quote the most secure election in American history and there's no evidence of anything being compromised. Brightbart has some great coverage. Brightbart has some great coverage. If you go back to 2019, both Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar were on a high horse about how how Dominion voting machines could easily be hacked and how the whole system was insecure. So they've really been running with that one. It's quite entertaining. Someone sent me a tweet today. I'm not on Twitter so I don't know about this. I have to hear about all of it secondhand. Someone sent me a tweet today that Trump is still going on about this, that they're stealing Pennsylvania. Because I have a tweet from him here on my notes. This is from, it must be a week ago now, that there's a bunch of votes missing in Pennsylvania. There are supposedly 47 USB Josh never misses a step to say he's not on Twitter. It's bad for discourse and it's bad for your brain. There are supposedly though, I believe this is confirmed. Maybe I don't know. 47 USB sticks that are missing from Pennsylvania. But it's important to keep in mind that in all of the districts where Dominion voting machines were used, Trump won in all of them. Every single county, every single district, wherever there's a Dominion voting machine in Pennsylvania, Trump won. So maybe there's some votes missing, but it doesn't actually affect the final tally. So I have a theory about all of this as well, about why there's so much misinfo being spread here. Let's go down this rabbit hole because there's many fingers pointing in many different directions here. Calling it the most secure election in history will only cause more skepticism even if it's true. That's a good point for sure. Part of what we're learning here is that there's simply no more consensus reality in American life. There's not a form of logical argumentation that's going to win people over to your side. I mean, what could the New York Times really show them? How could the New York Times prove anything to them after demonizing their whole demographic, demonizing their cultural values and everything? Really done themselves a disservice for trying to logically convince someone. So this month was the big blow up for Newsmax. They went up to number two on the App Store very quickly. Most of this, for my understanding, had to do with a representative from Texas, Louis Gomer, who is on Newsmax in an interview talking about a few of his sources who are, quote, former Intel people. They are giving him information that Dominion is rigged. Dominion is owned by a company called Smartmatic. Smartmatic in turn is owned by a company called CITLE. CITLE is based in Barcelona. And it runs all of the data collected through the Dominion voting machines, the physical voting machines clearly are in the US. And the data is sent overseas to the server in Frankfurt, Germany. And all of these represent opportunities for foreign interference in the American elections. It gets especially curious because on the board of directors of Smartmatic is someone named Peter Neffenger, who's a retired admiral, who happens to be on the Biden transition team. And there's someone on the board of directors of CITLE, who is also part of George Soros' Open Society. Hmm, hmm, so what you're telling me now is that the companies that are doing all of the election data also happen to be part of Biden's transition team, his new government. And they work for George Soros. This sounds pretty sketchy. What is going on here? That's a place where all of this information was cycling through, not supposed to, but it was. And actually there was a German, as I was told, there was a tweet in German from Germany that the US Army had gone in and seized the civil server. They're going through bankruptcy right now. So there's all kinds of getting played. And I suggested that the president might get information from CITLE. And the next day before, and I sent him specifics that he needed to get that would be, would show a lot of fun. And the next day before that information could be gotten somebody ordered the US Army, according to the tweet, to go in and seize the server. There are people involved inside the government that have been trying to take this president down State Department, Intel Community. On top of this, it gets a little bit more cookie. Louis Gohmert on Newsmax, he says that the US Army in coordination with the Department of Justice in Germany is planning a raid on this server to get the data out of there. So trying to figure out what the hell is going on here. The evidence for this theory that the US Army is going to invade Frankfurt and grab the server is an anonymous tweet in German that someone had sent to Louis Gohmert. So no one really knows what's going on with that one either. CITLE, of course, releases a press release, which denies all of this might not necessarily be the people that you are most inclined to trust. The motto for their company is, quote, innovating democracy. Like, all of these fucking, all of these companies, like, would you trust an app called Dominion? Like, that sounds super fucking, it sounds like Star Wars, first of all. It sounds like some, it sounds like some fascist larp out of Star Wars. And then you have CITLE, you know, quote, innovating democracy. All of these things sound super, super sketch. But I'm trying to get to the bottom of this story because now it's like, I'm at this point, I'm watching these really grainy, clearly ESL auto cut together clips on BitShoot. Like, I'm sure this is in terms of media diet. This is just like sugar and junk food and trans fats. Everything I'm watching is fake. I know that at some level, but I'm also kind of getting piled in the process. The CITLE website crashes because so many people are in there sending email requests. It's just flooded. It's overwhelmed the website crashes. This is now used as further evidence that the Dominion software is bad because their website couldn't handle so many people. Okay, so trying to figure out, trying to sort out what's really happening here. It turns out that Dominion and Smartmatic and CITLE are all actually competitors with each other. They have nothing in common. They share no data. No one is sending the data overseas. There's no US military raid on Frankfurt. The anonymous tweet from Louis Gomerne on Newsmax is completely made up. All of this is just a rabbit hole of disinfo that the missed parts very quickly. There's not really much here at all. I was really ready for this one to be the Democratic Party. We do a lot of joking on this stream. But legitimately, the Democratic Party is the most corrupt institution on the planet. I was already... I was a very receptive audience. I was willing to be convinced that they were stealing the election. Despite my willingness, I couldn't actually find enough credible info to be convinced. I feel extremely confident that there's literally nothing to this. It didn't take me that long to get through it. I think this was a few hours of searching, a few hours of sifting through right-wing media, listening to a bunch of videos, browsing bitch-shoot, and things like that. Looking on Telegram, a bunch. But pretty quickly, within a few hours, you get to the bottom of it. A few hours, LOL, that's a while. I'm actually... I'm really... I've spent days looking at this. I have a problem. I can't tear myself away from right-wing media. So what's going on here? If it's very clearly false, and you can get to the bottom of that, you know, me not being an investigative journalist or whatever, how are all of these right-wing channels, all of these influencers that I mentioned before, why are they all towing the party line, if it's clearly fake? And I think, this is my working theory currently, the margins by which Biden won are actually very narrow. This... this tally, keep in mind, is outdated, but a margin of around 15,000 people in a few different counties could have flipped the results the other way, and Trump would have won. So my thought for this is that these right-wing channels, these right-wing influencers, are at some level aware that they're shilling a lie, that they're telling a fiction. But the... the objective here is to so-enough disinfo that they can build a life raft for Trumpism, and they can survive for another few years, and they can make a comeback in 2024. I think that they need to know on some level that they're lying, but in the greater interest of the Trumpian project of Trumpism as a whole, they need to keep the dream alive. And I think that helps to explain why the narrative is shifting so much, because it's a pretty thin margin. Is it rigged voting machines? Is it dead voters? Is it voter fraud? Is it ballots being destroyed? Is it that China is running the... the data? Is it that USB drives are missing? What have you? It's not really any of them. It's very clear that they all turn up dead ends, but you just need to so-enough disinfo that people distrust it for one reason or another, and that will carry you through. So, major takeaways for this, major takeaways for the election. A little bit of a white pill here, we have some good news for the left. DSA endorsed 40 candidates, and 29 of them have won. I believe there are three that are still awaiting a final count. Let me check the... I actually have a link here to a document that's keeping the tally. So, let's see, is it 29 or... Okay, three races still not called yet. We have 29 confirmed that may go up to 32. But, hey, I mean, three out of four is really not a bad ratio. Major predictions for the end of the Trump era. A lot can happen in the next few weeks, for sure. A big picture of what I'm expecting here is that these horseshoe characters, these Josh Hawley's, Tucker Carlson, and those types of guys, I think that their faux-workerist rhetoric is going to spike way, way up. When those guys are out of power, when they don't really have any stakes behind the words and the rhetoric that they use, they're going to sound really left. They're going to sound really class conscious in the near future. And, you know, potentially there's going to be one of these right-wingers who gets irony poised and by the rhetoric and actually chooses to walk the walk instead of talk the talk. So, I'm preparing, I'm mentally preparing for Republicans, or a certain wing of the Republican Party, I should say, to rhetorically flank the neoliberal Democrats from the left. Because they can really drive that wedge. They can really drive the wedge between all of the catastrophic neoliberal policies that Biden will undoubtedly pass. And the emerging Republican coalition that looks like the white working class and the latinx that are now coming out in record numbers for Trump. Speaking of, speaking of fake news in the internet, oh boy. Next on my list is Marjorie Taylor Greene. People will know her as the QAnon Congresswoman from Georgia. She is the full-blown Stop the Steel. Charlotte'sville was planned by the elites. She has said some really, really crazy things. Her social media is in artwork. It's really, it's really incredible. She has, she has a gift for the caption. I can say that for sure. I think some of the coverage of her has been a little bit overblown in that she's like some crazy new age or Q type of person. She is, I think, a pretty savvy operator, actually, for all of the dumb stuff that she says. I think she's a pretty smart operator. Because she's been distancing herself from Q for quite a while, for like a year and a half at this point. She's still labeled as the Q person, of course. But she now has this built-in plausible deniability that, you know, I was just friendly to those things, but I didn't really believe in them. I think Q is a bunch of misinfo. This is a quote, there's a quote of hers from this is at least a year plus where she described Q as being misinformation. And the way that she chose to do this is actually, I think, very tactical. She's saying Q is misinfo, not because the elites aren't smuggling Adrina Crome and doing, you know, sex cults and whatever, like, you know, all of that stuff is true. But Q was inaccurate in his predictions of a red wave during 2018. So during the midterm elections, Q had predicted a huge turnout for Republicans. That didn't pan out. And Marjorie, very tactically, very intelligently and strategically. Distance herself from Q by saying that, you know, his election predictions were misinfo. And that's why she doesn't trust him anymore. So she gets to hold onto all of the crazy stuff, but she also gets the sound bite out there that she's, you know, now broken with Q. Let's take a look at a few of her posts here. Oh my god, this is so good. These are so good. So, oh my god. Okay, so this is a bunch of bloodless cosmopolitan liberals that should probably all be in gulag. They're in these like personal domes, like personal bubble boy domes. And they're doing some type of a yoga downward dog thing where you stick your leg up. And I mean, the whole thing looks incredibly indulgent and pod life. Yeah, thank you, Matt, lab mat in the chatsang pod life. Marjorie Taylor Green, her caption work is really fantastic during my next time in social. Sorry, it's just really good. During my next time in socialist occupied DC, will there be a bubble provided for me to lift weights in? This is your future controlled by Democrats, hashtag Soviet vibes, hashtag, welcome to the gulag. I forgot about that one. Hashtag, welcome to the gulag. Damn. Pretty, pretty good stuff. I gotta say. We looked at this one on the stream before. This is her next to, I guess, a police officer fully decked out in body armor. Her caption reads, I think fully had a police escort from the Trump hotel to my lift last night. The streets of DC were a war zone, but I was left defenseless because of anti-gun Democrats who run this city. I will work every day to end gun-free zones. Seeing how the platforms have treated the last few weeks, how they've treated the election in general. We are approaching some kind of a point where I think if the Republicans win the presidency next time around, these platforms are going to be regulated into smithereens. They're going to be, at the very least, broken apart into different competing companies. At the most, they might be nationalized. That would be really the inflection point for the faux-workerist rhetoric of the Josh Hawley's and the Tucker Carlson's and what have you. In the meantime, Marjorie Taylor Green is, I think, a smarter actor than most people have given her credit for. I mean, she knows how to rile people up. She has the Q constituency appropriately folded into her base without needing to explicitly come out in support of those things. It strikes me as very effective strategy. Laura Loomer walked, so Marjorie Taylor Green could run. Laura Loomer, by the way, almost 40% of the vote. She did not, like you remember, when Sargon of a cod ran, and he got 1.5, these meme candidates who are social media celebrities first and politician second, she had the opposite. I mean, she came in with, I think, at the end, 39.5% of the vote, end-sloan 94 in the chat says, I'm looming. That's pretty good. I can't believe I haven't seen that one before. That seems like it's begging to be me and yeah. Oh, because we're just chatting with Brad. Laura Loomer, by the way, de-platformed from everything that exists. She's de-platformed from Uber Eats. That was the big one. And now she's been kicked out of Petco in a recent post. She really is. Yeah, Laura Loomer walked, so Marjorie Taylor Green could run. I think that's the takeaway here. I wanted to end the stream here with something I've been thinking about for a few weeks in parts spurred by the documentary we watched in the Discord channel arguing the world. We'd mentioned this on the last podcast. I wanted to put a big frame around this conversation and respond to a general right-wing criticism that, quote, the left does not exist. That there is actually no such thing as the left now at this specific stage of historical development. Because all of this work of political education and recruitment online, if we don't take this criticism seriously, we're going to lose people, we're going to lose parts and minds in general. As Destiny the Streamer once said, you are responsible for how people misinterpret you. In general, there are two conspiracies running through American society. The right-wing version of this is that the ruling class and the working class are colluding against the middle. I'm borrowing a big chunk of this from Elizabeth Brunick. And the right-wing conspiracy, the right-wing narrative, begins at immigration pushing wages down all the way to the great replacement and all the rest of it. There's also a left-wing version of this conspiracy that the ruling class and the middle class is colluding against the underclass. And that looks like people in red states voting against their economic self-interest. It looks like white supremacy and everything else under that umbrella. So the right will tell you that the ruling class and the working class are in collusion against the middle. The left will tell you that the ruling class and the middle class are colluding against the bottom. And both of these are partially true. And so I think part of what we're watching now, I'm paraphrasing some of this from Chris Coutron, that what is being played out through the Democrats and through the Republicans, is an infra ruling class conflict between finance capital and productive capital. Finance capital is Wall Street, its pharma, its intellectual property. Productive capital, on the other hand, is manufacturing, its small business, etc. It's hard tangible products. And very roughly, this infra ruling class conflict is divided between the Democrats and the Republicans. And so when we look at these right-wing criticisms of the left and they say something like all of the anarcho-communist wing, all of the antifa people, they can't really ever pass any of their ideas. There is no policy if you ask an anarcho-communist, how does communism work? You get a 45-minute explanation that makes little to no sense. The people within the group can't really agree on it. And instead, what they do is they just seem to pave the way for general run of the male neoliberalism. That is the critique from the right. And as people who really do believe in the theoretical part of it, who believe in all of these foundational tenets of Marxism and want to see that class analysis take place, I do think we are overdue for a serious recollection of who are we fellow travelers for right now. And what the documentary the other week brought up for me is that eventually over the next few years, these two competing belief systems, meaning in this case the interests of finance capital and the interests of the working class that currently make up the constituency of the Democratic Party, there's going to be a wedge driven between them. Maybe it's the worker's rhetoric of Josh Hawley and Tucker Carlson. Maybe it's something else. But if that is really the only political alliance that is available right now, we might want to start shopping for other partners. If we look and we take a wide historical view, most successful revolutions have some element of an infra ruling class dispute. And there's a section of the ruling class that makes an uneasy alignment with a radical insurgent group. And this is used to topple the existing political structure and install a new one. But the radical group never really gets to take power. It's just the ruling class interest that they find themselves in alliance with. And we're constantly talking about this political realignment that may happen in the next few years. The element of the ruling class that we would want to be realigned with would be the productive capital that is currently in bed with Republican Party rather than the finance capital that seems to be steering the Democratic Party. Eric says agree, been feeling this way about a potential party split in 2024. This is part of the culture war. It's part of the rhetoric. If we look back to Nietzsche's slave morality and master morality, there is something to be said about the ancom or the anarchist desire for this non hierarchical space and minimizing harm and whatnot where it really is okay for them to lose at certain points. It is kind of built into the system. And so this alliance between the radical anarchist under class and the finance capital over class is very comfortable in a moral sense in that once their candidate finally takes office, they can then lose their ultimate objective of pushing their candidate left. Because if you were to ever really take power, then you would be responsible for all of the evils of the system. So I found myself wondering the coming wedge and the coming realignment that's going to reshape the parties as we know it. And what all of the pieces in the puzzle happen to be now. There's going to be some uneasy alliance between the middle class, the working class, different elements of the ruling class and what stands the best chance in the future. Big picture analysis here. I don't think we're going to be able to win Medicare for all in the electoral field. Unfortunately. And so what we need to be looking at is as America is competing with all of these other nations, there's going to be an internal assessment that says, why are we spending 20% of our GDP on health care? That just goes to a very narrow portion of the ruling class that 20% of our total productivity in the society of the real economy, we spend a ton on health care that is basically a slot machine that feeds directly to this narrow portion of the ruling class. We need to remain competitive. We need to build our military. We need to do XYZ. Somebody's going to have to tighten their belts here. We're not going to upset the political economy of capitalism in general, but the arrangement of the seats of the table among the ruling class is going to have to be reshuffled a little bit so that we can remain competitive with China so that we can remain competitive with everyone else. And the people who are going to who are the most wasteful, the most parasitic are certainly the people behind the American health care industry of all the ruling class. These guys just collect bills and drain society, but this is where it gets tricky. Those guys are steering the ship of the Democratic Party. So what you would want is an alliance between the working class and the productive capital that is currently working with the Republican Party, and ideally those pieces can be coordinated in the coming realignment. Aurora and the chat says, if Trump's 2015 rhetoric, no wars, no military expenditures, universal health care, pro-union dot dot dot whatever that meant for him, it would have forced this wedge sooner, but he became orthodox, heritage Republican because he had no political infrastructure. To make his improv rally takes come true. Exactly, that's exactly it. What is most important to remember here is that the Trump rhetoric won the last time around. He couldn't he couldn't do the plan because he was a goddamn idiot. You know, he was corrupt. He was whatever, but the rhetoric won. I lose followers every time I repose something from your Insta. Yeah, yeah, well, I am personally looking forward to the next explosion of the over 10 window. We are sitting on a powder keg right now. Don't delude yourself. brunch cannot last for more than a year. These narratives are so brittle, they're about to blow apart at the seams. The last thing that I'll leave people with is a few months ago, there was a study from the night foundation called the 100 million project. And generally, there is a pervasive narrative in American society that there's an overwhelming majority for the Democrats. Most people don't vote because they're frustrated with the system, but if you allowed everybody to vote and you expanded the franchise and you had this perfect direct democracy without the electoral college and whatever, whatever, that you would get an overwhelming landslide for the Democrats. And what the night foundation did, this was a survey from a little bit less than a year ago is they looked in depth and they did detailed polling of the 100 million Americans who don't vote. And what they found was that it is split almost exactly down the middle. The pervasive narrative through the media is this idea that we are right on the threshold of power. All that we need to do is allow people to get to the ballot box and then the Democrats will have this overwhelming victory. And it is fundamentally not true. It's a piece of propaganda. So signing off for my horseshoe rant tonight that will surely get me deplatformed and sent to gulag and everything else. Thanks guys, this was fun. I'm going to grab another drink and get to a little bit of editing. Welcome to the new apartment by the way. We will be set up streaming. Hopefully I'll be off the floor for the next one. So I have a desk that's coming on Monday. And yeah, this is fun everybody. I'll see you soon. Now the moral of our tale is don't blindly trust the news. Their goal is making money. They live to get views. What should matter is people. What's human and what's true. Look past the headlines. Don't let them think for you. You will be shit. Holy shit.",

      "text": "Welcome back to the podcast. In this episode I'm speaking with Taylor Lorenz, who is a journalist at the Washington Post. I first met her in 2018 when she was writing at the Atlantic and caught my attention with a piece about young, radical politics on Instagram. In my opinion, Taylor is the preeminent journalist on all things social media and emergent viral trends. She's a returning guest to the podcast and this time we're talking about her forthcoming book, Extremely Online. There's a purchase link below in the show notes for this episode. Let's get into it. I'm very excited to have you back on the podcast. What we first heard about in the last podcast was that you've been writing a book that is now coming out on October 3rd of 2023 and you've also been very busy ruthlessly shit posting on your meme account. I have to ask if your book editor or any other publication you've worked for has asked a question about the wild shit that you posted that account. I have a lot of accounts. I mean, I think anywhere I work is aware of my insane internet presence all over on every platform. I've gone through a lot. I mean, this is a new one. I have I've been banned unfortunately for community guidelines violations previously. I know one but I love Instagram. I've been a Instagram person forever and I'll never give it up no matter how many times they ban me. My shit posting days are largely behind me at this point, but I have certainly gotten a few questions or raised eyebrows as sometimes much more than a raised eyebrow from different people in universities and institutions and publications that I write in. But we're here today to talk about your forthcoming book extremely online. The untold story of fame, influence, and power on the internet. Maybe I can ask you to just tell us about this new book that you've been working on for two years now. It's funny. I was talking to Simon as she's story recently and I need to perfect my elevator pitch. But it's basically this story of the what people which I hate that term creator economy, but it's about sort of like the influencer world and how that whole industry emerged. So it starts in like the early 2000s through 2020 to today when everyone is completely immersed in it and sort of how the industry built itself and how our perceptions of fame and attention changed and how these platforms like a lot of platforms emerged and fell and also like the user impact, the impact that power users had on these platforms. I think that we've had so many tech books that tell the corporate side of the story and like the Facebook book or the YouTube book. But we never hear from the user side. And in fact, users are just as influential as the tech founders in terms of products. It talks about these power users, what people would call influencers now, but people with large followings are a lot of impact in how they shaped the platforms and also our culture. I guess it's last year these twitch leaks. Obviously, there's a few. This is the case on pretty much every platform. But on Twitch, especially there's a few creators who are just like massively massively disproportionate like they are essentially the whole platform in terms of the view numbers in terms of the revenue and whatever. There's actually examples of this in World of Warcraft where the game masters, the GMs, will send a personal message to certain players who have they're holding too much of the auction house of like the server's economy that this person could crash the global economy if they chose to liquidate a certain asset or something like that. In this example for a social media platform, if too much of your revenue is concentrated into a small group of users, that makes them really, really powerful and they can make demands over the platform. We also have negative examples of this where I think if something like Vine where the creators tried to organize and then we're not very successful in the platform no longer exists. Obviously, maybe in the course of this research, this history of the creator economy, are there certain points that stick out to you as being an inflection point or a moment of success or a low point in that story? Yeah, it's funny. You mentioned Vine. I have, I could have written an entire book on Vine. There's just so much there and I wrote a lot about that tension because I think that was such an inflection point when Vine failed and the hostility that they showed towards their creators. I mean, the founders of Vine were openly antagonistic to content creators and so a Snapchat, which I think really ultimately hurt Snapchat as well. As my book talks about tech platforms, I always viewed content creators as scammers and spammy people that were exploiting the platform and weren't using it the way it was intended. Facebook notoriously has had this hostile relationship with content creators and I talk about the Facebook versus Myspace visions of the internet and Myspace is funny because Myspace talked so much about itself as an entertainment platform and almost the exact same language that TikTok uses today and had this very similar vision to TikTok actually in terms of discovery and fame and attention but they failed ultimately and I think it was before people were used to putting a lot of themselves on the internet. And then a lot of those people tried to go to Facebook and Facebook was like basically like fuck off. And I just, I think about something like the launch of the news feed which a lot of people don't think of as something on the timeline of influencer culture but I think it really taught all of us to start posting for an audience on the internet which we've never done before. And so this awareness of like posting for an audience and having people that you don't necessarily know in your immediate circle know things about your life like that's just its influencer culture on a micro level. And I think a lot of times people think oh I'm not above, you know I'm not an influencer I don't participate in that but we all participate in that just even the way that we come out of ourselves today like it's all sort of like has those roots so. And I talk a lot about bloggers too. I mean I started as a blogger and mommy bloggers and how they pioneered so much it's crazy. Yeah I mean I would go as far as to say that the switch from a chronological feed to an algorithmically sorted news feed was I think the biggest transformation of society as method of organizing information period the cascading consequences of that for personal relationships the idea that you are posting to an audience as a creative entrepreneur to the political implications of that you know not in abstract way in a practical way you instantiate an idea of the public by who it is that you're speaking to whose feedback you take into account and all sorts of things like this. What was the process like for writing the book are you going back and talking to different creators and influencers from the odds are there nimsels featured in the book that whose stories tell this arc. Yeah I think that's most of the book is kind of it's focuses on the users and kind of these influential figures or groups or user behaviors that kind of emerged so it starts I would say like this whole culture starts with blogging and especially specifically mommy bloggers and just how these women with blogging the first blogs were sort of these tech and political blogs in the the 90s there were tech blogs and stuff but really in the early 2000s is when the political blogging and tech blogging world took off and news but mommy bloggers were the first people to really commodify themselves on the internet and kind of monetize their personal brands you know you could say where they're like over sharing about which is so funny they were so chastised but for like over sharing and all stuff but actually when you read their blog posts it's like the type of stuff that any one of us would post on Instagram today are you talking about like a story about breastfeeding or something that feels a little bit private yeah or like just the challenges of like motherhood like you know like Sammy didn't you know through his bottle on the floor today and I'm feeling so depressed and lonely about that and they know one I mean the reason that that whole thing existed in the mommy blogging boom happened in the in the mid 2000s I guess you could say is because women's media was so sanitized and women's media like traditional legacy women's media never acknowledge the hardships of motherhood and it never interesting you never talked about things like postpartum depression or struggles to breastfeed and wearing diapers after you have your first child you know like all these like messy parts of motherhood and which we all is completely normalized now they were the first to really do it and when they monetized Heather Armstrong who unfortunately recently passed away but when she announced monetization on her blog in 2004 it was like a national scandal I mean people were mom she was just viciously torn apart by the legacy media who were like you know how dare you you know yes she's coming to eat their lunch it's like a market demand that they can't this notion of like women you should you should do the perform these activities silently and never for money you know even though this was a full-time job she was running her blog full time it required an immense amount of work yeah it's curious because we have these very weird ethics that comes with sharing stuff in the internet and a lot of people particularly of left political sentiments have this idea that everyone should give away everything for free inevitably what that result in is people doing extraordinary amounts like a full-time job plus amount of unpaid labor these ethics are are really totally backwards in their implementation so the idea of like that this mom should be remunerated for her work that is valuable to other people just seems like a common sense thing but it brushes up against all of these kind of really outdated 20th century bohemian ethics that yeah you should just be doing it in a decommodified space as if we're already living in fully automated luxury communism or something like this so it's very curious to me it's also an interesting thing because this is I guess the way that you're framing it here is that there's a relatively socially conservative women's media at the time and so this kind of level of honesty from an individual actor was a very progressive gesture to discuss the difficulties of motherhood which has now totally socially flipped where being a mom is completely conservative and transgressive well maybe this is a good segue to the second topic I wanted to talk about when we last got together in LA for the previous podcast you had a different working title for the book this was something like Gen Z the rise of influencers Simon and Schuster wanted Gen Z in the title they want they put that in the book announcement and I was like no it has nothing to do with Gen Z like this is this is the misconception and once I wrote the book my editor understood it but people don't understand it it's like they associate influencer culture with Gen Z it started with Gen X I talk a lot about reality television in my book as well and just like how that changed our perception of fame and attention and stuff but not to jump on yours in as you mentioned it but it just it's so funny because when they sent my book announcement out it had Gen Z and I was like no like it's nothing to do I think it's just Gen Z is the first generation to truly grow up immersed in this industry where like this industry is now multi billion how almost set to be a half a trillion dollar industry at this point right so it's very associated and also they do things without shame like they will call themselves an influencer you know young people will sort of take a lot of this stuff as a given because they've grown up in this world the kids of mommy bloggers are Gen Z Heather Armstrong's daughter famously spoke out when she was 18 and I think 2018 you know about her experience having a mommy while you know growing up and having their stepshirt on the internet so I don't know people used to really call me a millennial journalist it's so funny you mentioned Gen Z earlier because people would be like you know in my intros and stuff like oh she's the millennial and millennial and then I think in like 2017 it flipped and now I'm associated and I don't like to be associated with any generation because I think this is a continuum and I like to write about sort of technology as it evolves no matter if it affects mothers or children or anyone else you know yeah I have two I have two things on this because I absolutely relate to this in that sometimes when you're discussing topics that are the product of history putting them into generational categories is not the most articulate way of like defining a historical process but it is a convenient shorthand that encapsulates a bunch of things the problem with convenient shorthands is that when we used to say millennial you didn't necessarily mean someone who is born in 1980 like Kim Kardashian is technically a millennial but what you meant by millennial was someone who grows up on social media and now the idea of someone who grew up on social media has shifted to being Gen Z so whatever comes after it's like we're going to keep chasing this rhetorical slippage in the terms but I think for me there's a historical process that people are becoming aware of for me this is a product of political history as well and a lot of bad assumptions particularly stemming from the 1970s really in the 1980s that are now all coming to a head in the shape of climate political crisis and so on in which Gen Z now has to make decisions in a way that are totally transparent they cannot afford to have the rhetorical opacity or to pretend that you know they're just going around their career for like the love of the game and being in this decommodified space they have to ruthlessly be entrepreneurs in this in this new social media economy but the second part of my question is this because there are two things that suck out to me from the previous title one was Gen Z of course but the second was the creation of a new American dream which I do think it's still true I think that part is true how this it's been sold to people that way of course it never works out for 99% of people I mean it's so funny that is a line from my book proposal where everyone is told you can make it on the internet right and you can hustle hard and my book talks about the TikTok content houses and Gen Z it's not like some total historical thing I think it takes us from where it began to where we are today and the hustle culture of it all and the pressure cooker that these kids are put in into but I think these tech companies have sold it that way of like liberation and achievement and you know just get makes some start making YouTube videos anyone can do it when it's actually insanely hard to succeed and liberation always seems to mean unpaid child labor yeah how does that how do those things always go together interesting well I mean I think back to this article by Ben Davis who is the national art critic for art and at news so he's someone who's been very influential in my thinking in the past few years but he had a similar line this idea of a new American dream and I'm gonna paraphrase what he wrote in this article I don't recall the exact quote off the top of my head but something like social media put gas back into the empty tank of the American dream that there was a few generations really a historical era in which there was the possibility for upward mobility to do better than your parents this is the American dream and that was true for the boomers it was somewhat true for Gen X and then right around this tipping point of like the 1980s the onset of neoliberalism massive offshoring of industry decline of upward mobility and opportunity millennials hit that really hard but they did have social media the idea was that although there's not the possibility for any sort of upward mobility in society you can still get famous on the internet now you see this in the Gen Z form just a decade later and it's like my god this hideous monstrosity whatever we created I know but I mean both of us have careers thanks to the internet that's true which is great and I'm so grateful for that you know starting as a blogger but I feel like what it's become has been just so twisted and warped into this like yeah monstrosity and also just the competition like the level of competition because everyone now has access to like a better iPhone and you know like I mean of course not everyone in the world has access to the best iPhone but you know the bar has been lowered and more people are on the internet and the money that's poured into this industry especially in the past five years which my book talks about like is so insane that it confuses people you know they think that oh I'm going to get a piece of that pie I'm going to be mr. Beast or whatever and it's like that is the top 001 percent but it's the same way as we look at billionaires in American society and you know you see people oh yeah you know I identify with Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos or whoever and it's like you will never reach that level because it's impossible I think of these incentives on social media for people to differentiate themselves from the crowd to ruthlessly build a creative career to market yourself as a personal brand there's a lot of political chaos like downstream political chaos that comes from this insane competition of carving out a creative career you know imagine you map this into the field of journalism where it has more direct consequences there's young people who probably lean center left or center right but then to differentiate themselves and to do effective controversy marketing in this really really competitive economy they have to go extreme right and extreme pool there's so many examples of people like that and that I feel like I as millennial watch and came up with and I've seen them devolve into extremist influencers mostly on the right because I think you get a lot further if you cater to power the bizarre thing is that I think given the spectrum of the internet tim pool is now the center right because I mean I saw the Kanye interview that lasted about 10 minutes and I was like ah tim pool sounds like a reasonable person yeah against that foil of course yeah but I would absolutely agree that yeah this phenomena of I've heard it described as audience capture yeah that there is enormous enormous reward cycles for catering to the most extreme elements of your audience and then what happens is that if you try to push back say you know you're moving right or you're moving left and then you try to nudge back a little bit towards the center which is where you started out before you had to market yourself and set up this big media content platform if you try to nudge in the other direction your audience goes fucking crazy yeah I will say there are centrist influencers too though there are there are all the people involved there are insufferable it's just I think it's like I mean I think you get far by catering to power and you get far by defending powerful people those are the I mean look at like the deals that rumble is giving out to content creators like and rumbles of of you know right wing competitor YouTube that's backed by Peter teal like they're going out and call in which they acquired david sacks is podcast live show platform like they're going out and they're capturing people that assert a specific ideology and giving them huge huge huge deals look at the Stephen Crouter 50 million dollar you know like yeah there's a lot of money to be made on the right and there's not money to be made on the left on the internet in the same way but there's social capital for sure but I do think that like as more and more money has poured into the online space and especially on the right you just see a lot more people gravitating that way yeah I mean that is always the structural imbalance of describing left and right as equal alternatives because there is money on the conservative right to fund media organizations there is equally money on the liberal progressive left to fund publications but there's not like a trade unionist sponsored left publication that's offering people handsome sums of money to do their work you know you're working for like pennies on the dollar of what any of these other people are getting and especially in an American economy where you don't have the social democratic benefits of like a health service or child care or things like that people can't really afford to do underpaid work those are just the unfortunate conditions it's really detrimental we've touched on this in a few different ways but the effect of social media and specifically these algorithmic platforms what they've done to legacy media organizations and institutions they've kind of created conditions for dissident voices to be boosted you know I'm wondering if like because you've been formally involved in journalism in a serious capacity for a long time now I mean I observe it but I'm formally involved in the art world I'm not I'm not a journalist although I published in a few different places I wonder if you've seen over the course of your time watching this creator economy also being in legacy institutions have you seen those things drift apart have they become more like each other or what has been the effect between these two foils yeah it's been bizarre to watch I think that legacy media has been so completely unprepared and and actually actively ignorant like when you look at coverage it was just shocking to go through and read old stories on the New York Times and just be like wow you are so completely idiotic and wrong on like every single piece of this it's shocking how you know that it is I think if a war in particular that really sticks out yeah I mean right they're never on the right side of any issue but it's you know it's just crazy how unprepared they were and the hostility and the dismissiveness and that's what's so funny because they're so dismissive and the way in the article and the way they they write about influencers especially and I think also a product of the fact that reporting on the history of all this so much this entire industry was pioneered by women and and people of color but really women and gay people kind of like people in the margins that didn't have a voice in legacy media like we're giving an example of mommy bloggers right like yeah they didn't have and so they turned to the internet and they got huge followings and I think only recently we've seen like the cool like hot influencer guy emerge like but it's so funny I was writing about lonely girl 15 or you don't remember that of course yeah well and they cast and I was interviewing you know just one of the guys involved with it about casting the guy and the her boyfriend who played the boyfriend on the YouTube show and they were like we had to pick someone that wasn't very attractive because people wouldn't believe that an attractive guy would spend time on YouTube like building an audience it was totally unbelievable at that point and so it's just funny how our societal perceptions have changed and the way that people spoke about influencers was like these are losers in their basement or there wait I've literally streamed for my mom's basement for like two years so no hey no hey I mean maybe a rings true but also just like the sort of famous phrase was famous for nothing famous for nothing and narcissists fame whore you know like these and a lot of like really misogynistic language you know these women that build these brands I mean some of the first people to really productize themselves and launch companies off their audience were beauty vloggers so it's just interesting and I think that that was a huge reason why venture capitalist Silicon Valley people legacy media dismissed it because they were like oh these are just stupid silly women you know doing silly women things online because they're a narcissist taking selfies and I mean the way the media talked about these I have so many examples in my book just going back and seeing the way that the media talked about women influencers who in some cases built a hundred million dollar businesses huge brands that are sold you know all over today and they were just vicious and and just like oh these silly girls you know that is that's so interesting obviously social media massively rewards sexy selfies and all sorts of narcissism and whatever yeah so that's like okay we can carve out like a few different slices of the pie so that criticism is true to to a portion but then there really are these conditions of exclusion where people are basically what we're describing is being gate kept from legacy institutions they now need to go to the platforms they have to go direct the audience that they serve because they can't get past the editors who think well you don't really resemble the voices that we're used to hearing about and whatever and a misunderstanding of the market like I mean it's one thing that social media can do for instance like Michelle Fawn you know she started with like these makeup tutorials especially for Asian eyes you know like it was serving these like niche markets that mass media was never really able to serve and that's just an example in the beauty but I think it's true of like any type of content like you can find this like really lucrative small niche community online and build a successful business around that but if you're a mass media institution you have to appeal you know legacy media in 2010 that you're doing a national magazine like you have to appeal to the widest audience and so ultimately that kind of hurt them because I think when they came to the internet it's all about niche I don't know it's been interesting to work within these institutions because I used to work as a social media editor it was just so dismissed well I think if I'm thinking of this example that it's been a while since I talked about this so I may miss some of the details but in 1989 when you were looking at the top 100 for music all of this was done by basically people at the magazines calling up record store owners and saying hey how much did you sell this month and what are the numbers and so on and so forth and then in 1990 they swap over to what we would imagine today is like scanning the barcode on the CD and then the numbers are just outputted directly and there's no gatekeeper or intermediary in the process and all of a sudden in 1990 you get the first country music album that hits the music top 100 you get the first heavy metal album and all of these different genres that were not considered part of like what American pop was but that's actually where the market and attention were and so in the years previous the only conclusion that you can derive is that the record store owners were reporting their own biases to the magazines and that's how the information was being relayed so it's a very interesting kind of analog where yeah certain voices are kept out of the legacy media institutions and then go to the platforms and all of a sudden oh look there's this huge audience and market demand and I totally think that those things are important and I would say that probably my experience is similar to that and that I hit a lot of friction in the art world talking about transgressive memes and edgy politics I had to skip participation in those institutions and go direct to the internet with my work I absolutely relate to that but now we're at some kind of weird inflection point where it is no longer representative of what real audiences they serve or public that they serve the dynamics of social media maybe that negative side of the narcissism and the controversy marketing has been totally taken over by like the most extreme like insane influencers when do you think that that happens was there an inflection point where this thing flipped and all the sudden the internet as a democratizing force was replaced by the internet as an extreme force yeah I mean I talk about this in the book but gamer gate I think was a was a really important moment in time because it really showed how the internet could be weaponized in really horrible ways I haven't thought about gamer game so long as holy shit okay yeah I think that was a really influential moment that kind of got forgotten about because I think people focus so much on 2016 but I think when you look back to 2014 you saw a lot of this radicalization emerge and a lot of these these infl I mean look at the influencers that came out of game or gate Candace Owens like you know it birthed a lot of people that are really big and influential today actually especially on the right and so and it provided this kind of playbook not just for online harassment but for sort of like mainstreaming extremist views and I think a lot of influencers you know picked up on that I think also the prank era of YouTube which was really 2017 that is YouTube sort of switched the incentives on the platform and there was this boom in daily vlogging and this pressure for content and to get view that was sort of like the rise of views culture and you saw people doing insane things like staging fake acid attacks like Logan Paul vlogging a dead body like Jesus Christ just a lot of extreme content that was sort of normalized I guess and I want to say that like they should be held financially accountable for everyone who got injured by some kind of prank attack if they created the incentives for people to go out and do that like that's just I mean it sounds criminal it sounds well they're having criminal I mean there have been criminal charges against prank YouTubers um I mean okay lock them up yeah I mean I'm daddy oh five I know they lost custody of their children over forcing their kids to do pranks and oh my god I think that era also set the stage for a lot and it normally it like pushed what was acceptable to do on the like things that were acceptable to do on the internet so far that to to surpass that you had just be more and more extreme and ridiculous and yeah well what do you think about Twitter has radically radically transformed in the last few months at this point some of these changes are incremental and you can kind of feel the shift in a YouTube algorithm you can feel the shift in an Instagram algorithm and then there's like activist investor that just takes over the platform and remakes it into whatever it's going to become do you think that's going to happen across other platforms as well um I think it would be so hard because it's unique it's I mean Twitter was uniquely susceptible Twitter never really got its act together it's always been a weird platform I talk about this in the book too but like it kind of never really found its way I think Jack was always kind of a weird guy and not really like that silicon that you know Mark Zuckerberg Mark Zuckerberg is not going to give up control of Facebook of course yeah yeah um and same with bite-dance they're not gonna get a relinquished power at all unless they're forced and I think Twitter was in this weird susceptible place where it didn't quite know what it was and it was struggling to compete with apps like TikTok that have emerged I do think that the era of big broadcast based social platforms is somewhat dying I think that the notion of us having everything that we post sort of public and searchable and to every single person in the world is something that people less like younger people like less and less want to engage in like it seems psychotic actually I'd also then to have that record be permanent like that's fucking crazy like it is I think you know if Twitter was founded today there's no way that tweets would not be a femoral I would imagine like at least have them disappear after a year of course or like we're 24 hours or what I'm 48 I mean it's just very weird to have this like long chronological text I agree I agree yeah but I don't know what Twitter's I mean Elon's been so hostile to content creators and really alienated all the power users I saw a thing today saying it's currently some bank valued at 33% of the value that he bought it for oh boy I don't obviously he's not recouping his money but who knows it could be you know I know he wants to make it until some payments platform or whatever yeah I mean I wrote a sub stack piece about this kind of speculating on a few different pathways for all these platforms to take it was called the platform wars where you know essentially in the last few months a few weeks even all these platforms have deployed nearly identical tools of rolling five dollar subscriptions long form posts for premium users live streaming I they just look more and more identical whereas you know when I think of like 2012 there was soundcloud for music and there was Instagram for pictures and there was Twitter for words now it's like you can get everything on pretty much every platform so yeah there's going to be a fierce period of competition and I think it'll be much more difficult to move audiences between those very distinct spheres so difficult yeah which prefigures I think exactly what the Elon Musk plan is is to create this x everything up where you now get like the problem is is like the core lesson of my book is like do not alienate your power users like you know who and Twitter's power users are government officials journalists celebrities but and I wrote a piece about this last year I mean celebrities evolve a abandon the app completely it's in terms of entertainment world it's just less and less relevant and will you go back to it or will you switch over to blue sky I'm gonna die on it I'm I'm on two I'm on everything I mean I I love it yeah until he bands me again when he banned me in December I was kind of like oh my god I'm free but I have I mean I just I have a lot of I have like some meme accounts that I started on Twitter that I still have access to if I want to spend one up again or something yeah you can't me boys I also like to write about it I don't think that blue sky is gonna replace Twitter like I don't I think that the way things are it's gonna fragment and a lot I mean a lot of the core use case of Twitter is already been replaced by TikTok like I give this example before but like you know if you're driving down the highway and you see some crazy fire or you see an insane thing happen I was just in can and like you know everyone has their phone open to TikTok because that's where you go to share that's and I think five years ago if you saw something crazy you would probably share it to Twitter right right now TikTok because of the discoverability is just the default place to share breaking news and as a journalist like you know if I'm looking to talk to someone after school shooting or something like you go to TikTok now you don't go to Twitter because no one would no one's on Twitter we talked about giant incentives for web to race for scale controversy marketing stuff like this I've never really had a personal investment in Twitter I done mostly on Instagram because I came from the background of the art world so I tend to think if we vulcanize the media ecosystem a little bit and we have different alternatives for platforms maybe that is a net positive for having you know radical groups from the right and radical groups from the left just a buffer of distance between each other that they're not fighting all day on one app like Twitter yeah and we keep them separated and then maybe that's better for just social consensus and political harmony in general the thing is I mean I think this is what's been such a big point of discussion on blue sky I don't know if you are spending time on there recently I'm on there but I it's hard to keep up with everything yeah so there's been a bunch of discourse on there recently which because you know they're starting to scale and so you're never going to get these like trolls and and I think you know they started with this tech user base but also like very progressive user base and the problem is is like the people on the far right especially they want to dunk on the progressives that's their whole thing that's why apps like truth social and gab and stuff don't take off because they don't have the liberals there to like dunk on they need that for their content that is that's very funny that's okay I see that yeah so I just don't know that they'll want to I think that would be better for society for sure if they were sort of like things were more separate and also just there's so much context collapse on Twitter that like you know you say something it gets sucked into the other that that's the worst yeah so I do think it's I think the move towards private spaces and separate spaces and going to places specifically to talk about a specific thing is is good but I don't know if that's going to happen the so these gab alternative sites or whatever they'll always be in some way like parasitic on literally the traffic and the content of other platforms because they need the stimuli they need an antagonist for the worldview or something like that that sounds very shmidian actually and the formulation of an enemy is like what constitutes the political and so on like okay I think that's probably true I mean I've done a fair amount of work in the last few years of like following gab and parlor parlor no longer exists now truth social is like all these places are just like it's like a wild west ghost town where there's like the cutout of a building but there's nothing behind it like nobody's on these platforms like period so yeah they're just totally parasitic on whatever happens in Twitter then they imported to the next place where they can have relatively less moderated conversations all of that said there was actually a very interesting proposal from parlor about community juries for TOS potential violations it was wild because it was the kind of thing that you see from like democratic socialist type people of like we should have community consensus guidelines where they were recruiting user volunteers to do like their moderation which was basically because they could not afford to pay anymore moderators because they were running out of money and then you know a few weeks later like the whole platform just collapse and was sold to somebody else so but it was an interesting kind of austerity slash democracy move for a period there okay so we're we're riffing through all of these different social media platforms legacy media different ways of publishing your work i see you in the legacy media i see you on twitter and blue sky and ticktalk and youtube do you ever think about making an exit from the media world and just becoming a content creator i started i mean i started that's how i started i started as a blogger and i got an audience i had an audience online myself prior to working legacy media and i think if i had had the monetization options that are available today i would have never gotten into legacy media the only reason i got into legacy media is because like to make it as a blogger it was really hard to monetize and do that and i had an audience but i couldn't get money you know from them right right so um yeah i think about it i mean i think it's just like reporting on this industry i know how what a hustle it is and i'm lazy and i also like i feel um i care about legacy media and that's why i want to fix it like i i think i i you know and it that's also probably why i always have tension at certain places that i've worked because it's like you get there and you just see how broken it is and you're like oh my god please like these institutions are important like some of the investigative journalism that happens it can only happen in legacy media like there's no way anything like that can ever happen on sub-stack you know like watching a post just did this fantastic investigation into like the AR 15 and there's just these amazing reporters that like they're never going to be influencers right they're just like phenomenal journalists but then they're unfortunately working for these companies that that just are inept and and really backwards in the way that they think and so i try to like be in the legacy media to push things forward and because i want to reach an audience i think that like i don't just want to talk to my followers i want to talk to people that disagree with me and i want to platform to talk to older people and older people are not going to watch my TikToks so but i i don't know i yeah maybe but probably who knows i need health care too that's yeah i hear you know i hear you i think i think the exact same thing when we met up for the last podcast we both discussed this analogy of a titanic heading towards the iceberg and being on the life raft hoping that legacy media and cultural institutions in my case would course correct to avoid the iceberg but in the meantime you have to kind of get out on the life raft otherwise you're gonna go down with the ship i guess the reason why i'm in the life raft is like i'm actually i'm just shouting to the titanic i'm like please correct course like i care about cultural institutions i care about legacy media and i think they are actually the key to fixing a lot of the political chaos that's happening now specifically because of the platforms i think it's probably a similar case for you where the work that you produce it becomes the corrective measure but if you don't have that possibility to exit you don't really have leverage to demand that the legacy media the cultural institution the titanic change course the one thing that you and i have always aligned on is that like these institutions are actually the most important thing to fix because the platform alternative is just so detrimental as the fix the point is to restore healthy trustworthy institutions and that is like the foundation of any democratic society yeah and i should say i mean i think the institutions have done this to themselves you know they've put themselves in the position that they're in by like just fucking everything up over and over and it's like they could fix it so in some some you know i think the days i'm feeling less charitable i have no sympathy and i'm like let the ne're times burn like they did it to themselves you know but then but then i think about the people especially you know and i understand the hatred towards these institutions as i feel it too but having spent time inside them there's there are really incredible earnest people that are doing really important real for democracy work and that deserves to be saved because that's never going to be replicated on youtube or whatever the fuck you know so yeah absolutely absolutely yeah yeah i totally agree okay well the book is coming out october third of twenty three pre-order pre-order pre-order okay pre-order is the best way pre-order is like it's so funny how much stuff is by amazon now it's like you have to get on the trending thing of amazon that i've that affects if like physical booksellers will carry the book and it's like this whole thing where you have to hack the amazon algorithm or and then also you don't want too many sales from amazon because if you're trying to get on like a list it has to be distributed and i also i mean if you go to the extreme on the link in any of my biolike i have the link to bookshop dot dot org to support independent bookstores and stuff to um but yeah pre-orders are like the number one thing that matters so if you think you might read it order it and i i hope people like it i think there's a lot in there and it's i mean it's just an interesting history and if we want to look forward we have to obviously understand where we came from and just like gives people a lot to talk about awesome awesome i'm super excited for it as an extremely online individual some say terminally online individual uh yeah i'm really looking forward to this book and tell her thank you so much for joining me on the podcast today this is uh awesome and yeah i'd look forward to

      "text": "Hi everybody, welcome back to the stream. We have a ton of content to get through on the stream this evening. Tonight I want to share with you what I think is probably I couldn't decide whether it was the best thing I ever wrote or the worst thing I ever wrote. And I have since realized that it is both the best and the worst thing I've ever written. This is part four of the platform wars. This is a series I've been publishing over the past few weeks and months and this is the piece I promised in the very beginning, a public option for social media. Going back years and years, myself, Mike Peppie, Brad Tramell, various reading groups, debating these ideas into ridiculous granular nuance that was entertaining and interesting for me. I really cared about it. I attribute most of that to being my higher education. I never got an MFA but I certainly learned a lot just discussing these ideas with my peers. It turns out that some of those ideas had a lot of predictive insight. They were extremely applicable in the years following. A lot of important stuff happened on social media in the tech field in general, in geopolitical competition between states. The tech sector basically rewrote the law in every aspect of our economy. I mean, I think the most important thing to emphasize for all of this is that we've watched various market failures from the private sector. We are just really running up against the limits of the private sector when you encounter a market failure that the private sector is unable to solve. That is definitely the point where the state needs to step in and correct the issue. Tonight, let's do this read. This is an elaborate shitpost of utopian thinking. Ryan says in the chat, elaborate shitpost of utopian thinking is the DNR byline. The platform wars Part 4, a public option for social media. Welcome to state book, a public option for social media. Beginning these debates over 10 years ago, I used to joke that the United States should nationalize Facebook and make it a division of the post office. If this was ever truly an option in the past, it seems highly implausible now, but the underlying provocation rings true and is more necessary than ever. So long as big monolithic platforms are privately owned and operated, lawmakers will perpetually operate decades behind new innovations and their downstream negative consequences. The good news is that the bare essentials for a public utility are relatively simple to design and do not need frequent updates. A public option for digital communications infrastructure is the only viable way to maintain regulatory control, user privacy, and democratic consensus. I'll read those again, regulatory control, user privacy, and democratic consensus, in bold. This digital extension of the post office will serve as the primary entry point to tax filing, claiming benefits, voter registration, official identification, and more. In the public option for social media, every citizen will be given a your name at usps.gov email address at birth. This unique verified account will be free from any tracking or surveillance and secured with end-to-end encryption. Data collection will be technically impossible, but user privacy will also be secured as a political right. Today, scammers may hack your Gmail account and make you jump through annoying and costly hoops to recover it. But if they open your physical mail, they're committing a felony. An envelope is very low tech, but it's an important example of how legal rights are often more secure than technical fixes in the long term. As we learned over the pandemic, having an email address is a necessary step to partake in many state services. To claim simple benefits like unemployment, citizens needed to transact with private email providers. These perverse incentives indirectly require users to produce data and value for companies like Google to claim resources they already own from the state. Statebook elegantly solves this dilemma by stipulating that all state benefits may only be accessed online by verified accounts within its service. This public option will not be a replacement for private services, similar to how the usps operates alongside private careers like FedEx or UPS. Statebook will run parallel to Gmail, Signal, Twitter, Meta, and others. Users are free to transact their commercial business or personal mail through private services, but they may only receive official communicates like voter registration and tax information through the digital usps. Each year, you will receive a pre-filled tax filing from the verified account IRS at usps.gov. Statebook will serve as the sole digital gateway to online tax filing. When it's time to renew your driver's license, passport, or other forms of official identification, you will receive a friendly reminder in the form of a statebook notification and access its ID services using your unique account. These official mandates will spur the greatest network effects of any platform yet to exist. Statebook's total addressable market is the entire population of the United States, over $335 million, with an impressive 100% saturation rate. This online extension of the post office will also include a digital deposit box that allows for postal banking. Postal banking is already available in almost every other advanced country. Logging into your statebook account will allow you to deposit, withdraw, or pay bills. Users may also choose to hold their deposits as treasury bills, purchased directly from the US government, and earn a handsome 5.5% interest rate, outpacing any commercially available high-yield savings account. Naturally, these assets will be insured by the FDIC. In instances where customer service is required, citizens wish to make cash deposits, or print physical copies of their digital mail, the USPS is glad to offer 30,000 brick and mortar locations, already operating and conveniently located in your town. United States Posting Service In addition to email correspondence with individuals, businesses, and state services, there is a highly popular feature called Post To All. Rather than landing in the inbox of a unique recipient, Post To All messages will be placed in a publicly accessible and algorithmically sorted newsfeed. But the newsfeed's on-state book will be organized much differently than services in the past. Posts can be tagged as temporary or permanent, edit histories will be publicly audible for as long as posts remain up. Text posts must include a minimum character count of 500 to substantiate controversial opinions. Posts over 1,500 words will have the option to be pay-walled, so creators are appropriately compensated for their labor. State book limits each user to a total number of 1,500 follows. Similar to the early design of Facebook, which capped users at 5,000 friends, if you wanted to follow a new account, you will need to unfollow another account. These strict limitations will force users to choose between following friends and family, or following celebrities and influencers. Facebook rewards long-term social connections over attention-hacking exploits. Unless follows are scarce, news feeds will inevitably tip towards pop stars and comedy clips. In the near future, users may log onto private social media services for tabloid-like entertainment, but will check state book for important updates from friends and family. Each day, users are given a capped total of 24 likes. This number is reset one stale. If you use them up before the time elapses, you may continue to browse further content, but no longer assign new likes. This limited number of daily likes will encourage users to respond to more meaningful content, and carefully consider how they spend their limited upvotes. Unless likes are scarce, news feeds will inevitably tip towards clickbait. To be sure, some users will carelessly assign their likes to pop stars or cute cats, and run out before they scroll further to see their cousin's baby announcement. This will certainly result in awkward conversations the following day, and provide ample opportunity for users to reconsider their values and priorities. A system of universal basic likes may open up the possibility for some disreputable influencers to attempt to purchase likes on third-party websites. This indirect form of advertising, i.e. paying other users to like your content, will be considered analogous to mail fraud. Banking of digital correspondence, obstruction of digital correspondence, will incur penalties of up to $25,000, and up to 20 years in prison, and mandatory public service as a content moderator. There are no bans or TOS violations on statebook, breaking the rules is illegal, and you get sent to jail. Any noise ban that receives over 10 likes will immediately be flagged as suspicious content. On statebook's unique algorithm, engagement has diminishing returns. Lengthy comment threads will decrease with each order of magnitude and eventually become counter-weighted. Tens of comments are fun, hundreds of comments mark a life achievement like graduation, but thousands of comments means a post is likely so polarizing that it casts negative externalities onto the rest of society. Only terrible things happen after a thousand comments. This recommendation algorithm is weighted against selfies. Your profile picture is your driver's license. There are no pronouns or additional information in your bio, just your legal name which can easily be changed using statebooks official service. While many of these features may seem counterintuitive to today's experience of social media, it's helpful to recall that on day one, statebook will have over 35 million active users. This unprecedented scale will allow it to enforce new behaviors that run against the attention dynamics of today's private platforms. Statebook is not subject to the competitive pressures of the market because it has a unique monopoly on features that are only accessible through its platform. It's literally the government. While these frameworks will not entirely eliminate negative behaviors, they will strongly disincentivize them. Digital Postage The USPS requires users to purchase a stamp in order to mail a letter. Meanwhile, we send our online messages for free and wonder why the internet is full of spam. A small user fee massively limits the infinite scale exploits of online advertising models and shapes all communication that occurs within this sphere. On statebook, all posts and comments will cost one-tenth the rate of a forever stamp. To have a content like long-form video will cost proportionately more, users will purchase digital postage at the set price of the current year and these units will be honored in perpetuity, similar to physical postage. The average Facebook page posts 1.6 times a day, for most users, the monthly cost of participating on public social media will be about $3.16, less than the cost of a single Patreon or Substacks subscription. We will explore these numbers in more depth later. Placing the posting costs onto users will have considerable social impacts. Commenting on someone's post will mean something much more than it does now. Although the fees are minimal, it shows that you care far greater than free to use social media. Digital user fees will also massively reduce spam and cause users to think more before they post. Undoubtedly, Efficient Autos will collect these digital stamps for posterity. Some may even treat them as an investment, a hedge against inflation or digital postage rate increases in the future. In fact, this behavior is encouraged by StateBook as it provides a healthy stream of revenue on the retail market and a trickle of royalties on the secondary. Rare stamps from 2024 have been known to fetch hefty prices from connoisseur collectors in 2049. The USPS will also generously maintain a digital national postal museum that users may freely browse for archival purposes, education and aesthetic appreciation. Civil servant moderation. StateBook is not for dissident political meme posting. It's the onboarding platform to digital public services attached to the bare essentials of social media. All accounts are unique and given to users as a right of citizenship. No one can be de-platformed and subsequently debanked. USPS or pseudonomous political posting may still take place on private platforms. StateBook employs a robust team of human moderators that carefully review all legal speech. There are no disclaimers or warning labels attached to content. All legal speech is permitted and protected under the First Amendment. User fees, minimum character requirements and redesigned algorithms will massively limit the divisive and outrageous content that overwhelmingly dominates on ad-driven alternatives. Content moderators work in two shifts, from 5am to 130pm and from 2.30pm to 10pm. Because StateBook is\u2026 From 2.30pm to 10pm, because StateBook is closed for lunch. The StateBook is closed for lunch. It's not a joke. It's actually very good labor practices. State mandated CES to do so. There's no reason if the government controlled the public option of social media. They would just close for lunch, like any normal other business. That would be a benefit to all society. The promise is a very good idea. Outside of open hours, users will be able to browse content, but they will need to wait until the site opens the following day to send new messages. While this was initially perceived as a mild inconvenience, users were ultimately grateful for the new rules, because let's be honest, anything posted after 10pm is usually regretted the next day. Twitter, Meta and other inferior private careers may graciously accept a small bump in their traffic during these off hours. The dynamics of free-to-use social media have caused many liberals and progressives to revise their commitments to the First Amendment. Online, certain types of inflammatory speech travel further and faster than others. To combat this asymmetry, platforms have attempted to replace time-tested political freedoms with terms of service and community guidelines. But, unsurprisingly, radical content still continues to dominate across all of social media. It's easy to forget that we already have rigorous legal frameworks for political speech. In the case of the internet, the problem has always been that social media is free to use, free to post, and free to browse, because it is wholly and fully supported by advertising. Unless we change the medium through which this speech flows by introducing digital stamps and paywalls, these band-aid solutions will continue to be ineffective. For example, imagine what adding the cost of a stamp would do to the quote-tweet button. Once we depart from the advertising model, protected legal speech will rapidly become the preferred framework. Citizen privacy To protect the privacy and security of citizen users, state book may only be accessed from inside the United States. VPNs are not allowed. Additionally, users will identify themselves with multiple points of personal history and bio-identification. Hacking an account or improperly accessing data will be considered a felony offense, analogous to opening someone's mail. In some instances, it may be considered an act of treason. State book uses end-to-end encryption, like signal, just like physical mail, users' letters are not visible to the postal service itself. No one can technically or legally open your digital envelopes. When private companies and corporations are inaugurated, we may consider assigning them a unique state book address categorized by EIN. At this point, Reddit libertarians are likely fuming. Why would I trust the government with my data? Question mark, exclamation point, question mark. The sole purpose of these Snowden revelations was to impart that all communications by United States citizens on private networks are already illegally surveilled by the worst elements of the state apparatus. Its surveillance is the existing reality. State book may eventually stand as a similar risk, but it opens up the radical possibility of new social benefits that the private option necessarily forecloses. In the case of regime change or authoritarian takeover, we can rely on state books end-to-end encryption making surveillance technically impossible. While rapid regime change is always a looming threat within democratic society, the strongest hedge against authoritarian takeover is a robust and politically engaged public, which notably is the greatest advantage of state book, achieved by bundling together necessary services like identification, tax payments, and banking with democratic processes such as voting. OK, but how are you going to pay for it? In a political environment where we launch 816.7 billion to the annual defense budget, it feels mildly insane to justify any other form of spending, but we will do it anyway. Right now you're getting big Web2 services for free because the indirect subsidy of advertising covers the cost of your user fees, advertising accounts for a staggering 90% of total revenue on Twitter, and over 97% of revenue for meta. The sole source of income dominates every design decision on the platforms. To get around this core problem, we need to find alternative methods of funding. The good news is that this problem has already largely been solved by an innovative technology called the stamp. Similar to gas transactions on Web3 platforms, this minimal user fee or digital stamp will fund the transmission and hosting of information without the need for advertising subsidies. ICDion in the chat says you can just print more money. You can do that, and we may do some of that. Imagine a social media it was off on holidays. Fuck yeah, that's what I'm talking about. It's closed like the fucking post office. You're trying to mail a package on Christmas, New Year's, not gonna happen. The doors are locked. We're doing the same thing on Statebook. Exactly. And everybody has the day off. All the content moderators have the day off too. That's what I'm talking about. Mailing a letter from New York to Connecticut only travels tens of miles, but it costs the same as mailing a letter that travels many thousands of miles from New York to Alaska. In a narrow market logic, this means that users are technically overpaying for messages that are sent to nearby locations like Connecticut, but underpaying for messages that travel very far like Alaska. This economic model of cross subsidization is designed to encourage correspondence and transactions between all users within the greater space, linking them together as a social body. The same protocols will apply here to digital stamps, one flat rate for all messages. Text, image, or video under a reasonable size will all be covered by a single stamp. Higher fees will apply for sending bigger files, just as with heavier packages. Flat rates encourage customers to reliably and eagerly use a service without incurring surprise costs. So-called overpaying for text posts will subsidize the greater hosting resources needed for video. Most posts will fall under the aforementioned flat rate digital postage, just one tenth of a forever stamp. In addition to disincentivizing flame wars and negative social behaviors, digital postage will also provide a tremendous source of revenue for state book. While these fees are minimal to each individual user, they create an enormous surplus at scale. In 2023, a forever stamp costs 66 cents. Digital postage will cost one tenth of this price, resulting in a 6.6 cent user fee per post or comment. In the United States, the average Facebook account posts 1.6 times per day. Over a 30-day month, this amounts to a total cost of $3.16, or an annualized cost of $37.92. Multiplyed by state book's active user base, $335 million, user fees will bring in approximately $12,730 million per year. That's a $12.7 billion starting budget in user fees alone. Each year, the United States sends about 15 billion letters and over 120 billion pieces of mail. Each of these correspondences are also potential candidates to be sent over state book at a greatly reduced cost with far less emissions compared to physical mail, all of which can be expected to increase revenue as email increasingly becomes the preferred method of correspondence. In 2000, the government of Iceland chose to sell its medical and genealogy data for private sector medical research. State book will include a data marketplace where citizens may choose to lease their anonymized data to public or private entities. The technical, medical, and social innovations produced with this data will be held as publicly owned patents, exploited for social benefit rather than private profits. The revenue generated through such leases will be credited to citizens as direct deposits into their state book accounts. Public digital infrastructure is designed for the benefit of society and rightly warrants resources. Similar to the United States Post Office, state book may also operate at a small loss, but this loss on the side of state ledgers must also be considered as a stimulus to individuals. By design, state book keeps prices below market rate to create spillover value for the private sector. New businesses are encouraged by having access to affordable and trustworthy service. The maintenance and upkeep costs of state book should be viewed as diffuse investment which facilitates new profitable transactions. For example, a Shopify store may send a digital receipt to a state book address, consuming approximately seven cents worth of compute while only costing 6.6 cents to send the message. But the transaction itself produces greater sales and results in new taxable revenue. To evaluate state book's profitability, we must look past its immediate balances and account for its broader impact on society and private business. State book addresses sent to a state book address from external private services like Gmail or Meta will also need to pay for postage in order for their correspondence to arrive. As state book becomes the default email address for the overwhelming majority of Americans, this newly normalized user fee will likely be adopted by private services. Instituting a standardized user fee will create a new source of income for private platforms and help shift them away from being fully reliant on advertising revenue. Up surprisingly, state book is also, in part, ad supported. But the ads featured on state book are only those that draw attention to the plentiful public services and utilities of which citizens may partake. The vast reach of this public platform will outperform all other physical and digital ad placement such that the full advertising budgets of all public entities shall swiftly be rerouted to the platform. The secondary revenue stream will further offset operating costs and bring valuable attention to abundant public services. Lastly, any overrun costs of state book should be considered as the obvious and necessary cost of preserving popular democracy against the backdrop of our existing social media platforms, whose ruthless, libertarian designs seek to inflame differences and irreparably fracture the social body. That's all. Okay, almost through this is my conclusion paragraph here, aside from a few very brief notes at the end of it. Digital public infrastructure is a necessary part of civic life in the 21st century. Years ago, many of us mistook free-to-use ad-driven platforms as the benevolent generosity of the private sector. We later learned that the hidden cost of these communication networks were offloaded onto journalism, creative life, and the political process. So the platforms purported otherwise. Their design was always political. They sought to liquidate institutions, erode social bonds, and usher in an era of frictionless and unregulated transactions. To restore political and cultural consensus, we need to redesign our communication networks along social democratic principles. Buying a stamp is a good place to start. That is part four of the platform wars, the public option for social media. Okay, I'm going to give a very, very brief paragraph here. I know Jack would be totally into this one. I do. I appreciate you signing up. You're signing up for state book. My last note here before I sign off for this evening. In the 2010s, I was a cynic against the backdrop of relentless techno optimism. In the 2020s, I'm an optimist against the overwhelming techno nihilism. It's important to remember that big social media platforms broke in the late 2010s. Between fake news, extremism, and disinformation, tech barons were finally confronted with the real social costs of the disruptive tools they created. Tech innovations of the millennial era, like free to use social media, disruptive startups, and the gig economy are now viewed with a deep skepticism by the public. The tools of the next generation will be built with these failed experiments in mind. New technologies and philosophies like platform cooperativeism could positively reconfigure today's online experience. The good part of hitting rock bottom is that it only gets better from here. Damn, we made it the whole way. We made it the whole way through. Damn. Okay. A few months, like trying to think really big picture about this, allow myself to go down all the larpy, ridiculous rabbit holes. There's a lot of stuff that I kind of exaggerated for comedic effect. Then I edited it back. I reeled it in. And I realized, actually, no, it is kind of a great idea to just close social media in the middle of the day. Close it for lunch. Treat it like the post office. We already have these time-tested frameworks of how humans communicate. Out of the boundaries of political speech, we don't need the tech sector to reinvent all of that. States and politics existed long before the internet. Let's stick with some of those existing rules that have seemed to work really well. I think that makes sense. Thank you for listening. I hope you've enjoyed this series. Starting the platform wars. Basically, I wanted to make an excuse for myself to write this essay. I wanted to compress all of the stuff that, like, Brad and Mike and myself had talked about for so many years, this politically-minded critique of social media, the limits of the private sector, where the state needs to step in to correct some of these things. And I wanted to put it all in the same place, you know? So probably to be totally fair, this is an essay that one of us should have written in 2011, 2012. Like, we should have written it 10 years ago when we first started talking about this stuff and imagining some of the future consequences of social media and all of these other technologies. So I started this series to have an excuse for myself to kind of compress all of that knowledge to make the elaborate shitpost that, surprisingly, in some moments, gives you a bit of insight that you didn't have before. So that is the power of suspending your disbelief. That's the power of large. That's the power of opening up your political imagination. And hopefully, hopefully, you picked up something from this as well.",

      "text": "Hey hey hey, don't put your middle to the desk Now, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, Hey hey hey, don't you know you're living with the best now? OK, um...can one of you tell me What the difference is between an indie developer and an indie veteran developer? Um, I would guess someone who's, you know, made indie games for... Well, I was gonna say who's made indie games for a long time. Indie games haven't necessarily been a thing for what I would call a long time. I don't know where this story's going. What's what's happening? At this point, I would, if you were to say that to me, he's the first name that would pop into my head would be someone like Brian Fargo because he's a veteran of the industry and is now making kind of indie stuff. Yeah, but he is still an indie developer, even if he's a veteran developer, right? The clue you would think is in the name? Yeah. It's just... No, I don't often republish hate mail. Most of it's just real spite that I send straight into the bin. But every now and then I get someone so confident and yet so wrong that I am wholly entertained before I then throw them straight in the bin as well. But I had to share this one. I tweeted it out. Um, I did a Jim Pression's video for Sea of Solitude. That game though, I think we were trying to remember the name of on this podcast a little while back. Yeah. The girl with the sea and the boat that EA showed off at E3 like the year before last. Um, it's part of the EA Originals label, which is a label specifically made by EA for indie developers. Yeah, it's like unraveled stuff like that. Yeah, unravel, um, uh, fail. Is it fail the other one? Games that they talk about at E3, then you never hear about again until it just suddenly releases. Yes, yes. And basically the EA Originals label is that that one thing EA does that's good that they're currently using to justify all the bad shit they do because they've done a good thing for a couple of studios that aren't the ones they bought and shut the fuck down. But anyway, I did a Jim Pression's video for Sea of Solitude and I called it a critical darling indie game about mental health. Very much like all the other critical darling indie games about mental health, which I said as a joke, didn't mean it, um, as a slight, per se. Except to say that I've played so many of them, I expect them to be outstanding to keep my attention. Yeah, um, because I do, I do like them, they do resonate with me. But anyway, so I called it an indie game because it is, because from Sea of Solitude's own wiki, Joe May Games is a Berlin-based independent game studio which is developing Sea of Solitude. Yeah. So I get this email and I think the only way that this email can be read is by, um, at something of an aristocrat with some elite gamer wisdom. Um, I guess so. Um, uh, Aniel, do I've caught if you could come here please? Thank you. Um, I'm just gonna give him the microphone. Um, FFST, Jim, this game isn't made by an indie developer. They're more like indie veteran developers, which is totally different than True Homegrown. The comparison is night and day. Team members, former jobs, budgets. You say you are a fucking game reviewer and reporter to do some investigating first. Every single time you say made by an indie developer, I find out that you are basically wrong most of the time, but fine, whatever. If they're not EA and the others, then they're indie. Okay, okay. Cool. Raston, I'm not an asshole. I'm a veteran asshole. So this person needs to hire a investigative journalist to investigate the meaning of the word veteran. Yes, and what the word indie is short for, I think as well. So in that context, like veteran is a modifier on indie. Like it doesn't stop them being indie. It's like, oh, you're an indie developer who has been doing this a while. So to them veteran means an indie with AAA, uh, for funding is that what veteran means to this person? I don't know. I mean, the list, it lists team. And I realize some people think it's takes this from me to go on and on about hate mail or I hate as whenever we do bring it up. But this one is just so amazing. Like the examples to show the comparison is night and day is team members, former jobs, budgets. So in order to be a true homegrown indie in their words, you need to have not had any previous job in the game industry. You've got to have, I guess, a handful of team members and no money. You need to have not served in the armed forces. Yes. Yeah. So like, I'm trying to think of developers that this person wouldn't consider indie devs. And the one that jumps to mind is 22 cans, the Peter Mollon new team. Like, yep, that's someone who's like an industry veteran. Like the better or worse, the quality of their games, you know, that have lots of people with previous experience in the industry. Lots of people that used to be at line line head. They got money. They've got a reasonably big team. I think not indie anymore. Because they seem pretty indie. I'll be honest, I feel like we've given too much time to a stupid opinion on the internet. Yeah, we probably have. There are so many to pick from and it's always the ones who are the least thoughtful and the least research and know the least that are by far the most confident about their views. No, you're absolutely right. Like, I realised that this is a bit tacky. I will fully own that. It was just so funny. It was just so funny. The EA Original's label is specifically noted by EA to be for Indies. It was the sheer confidence juxtaposed against the weirdly arbitrary wrongness. But that made my day, that just happened. That sums up the world at the moment really, doesn't it? Kind of, yeah. Unlike demonstrable wrongness backed up by arrogance and self-assuredness. That is 2019 in a nutshell. I have incredible personal news to take. Outside of that, something that is going to persmire on everyone's face. What is it? Right. A popcorn shart is out of my gum. How long has it been there? A long time. To the point where I started to doubt it was there and that it was just a wound from you trying to get it out. We're talking independent stage of life, when I went to see Mysterio, far from Mysterio. Like, I was rushing away on popcorn as you do in the movie theater. Yeah, as you do. And every now and then, people who eat popcorn will know that sometimes there is this risk of a bit, a shard from a hard bit from the shell, or going to your gum. I've occasionally had it go between two teeth and it feels like it's pushing the teeth slightly. It's like, oh, that's an uncomfortable sensation. Yeah, also really bad to do. Yeah, but yeah, yeah, this bit got in and I felt it and brush, brush, floss, floss, floss, brush, floss, floss, floss, floss. Get a bit of a collar of my shirt whenever I'm not near a toothbrush. Just to get something corset abrasive to try and get stuff out, pick out it, pull out it. I couldn't see it when I looked in the mirror. So it eventually got to a point where it had been so long. I was just like, well, maybe it is just inflamed now and it did go. But there was always this thing in my head that was like, it's gotta be still there. It feels like it's there all the time. Trust yourself, Jim. Don't doubt yourself. Yeah. Know what you know to be true. I was going to give it like a little bit more and then I was going to go see the dentist because I live in America and dentist is expensive. So I'm like, if I won't go if less, I really have to. And then just before we started recording, in between I started recording and me getting that hilarious nightmare. I was just idly going at my gum with my tongue and then just boop, just boop, out it pops. Take some advice from me if you think something is stuck in your body. Check, get someone to check because we, I don't know if you guys remember the time I stepped on the nail. Oh, yeah. Only found out two weeks later after the x-ray that the nail was inside my foot. No, is it still there? No, they took it out. That would be amazing. You could be old nail foot. Nail foot. The legend of old nail foot. God, it feels great having that out. So Jim, what, what, what did you think of the, the Mysterio film? Oh, did we, we didn't talk about it. No, no, no, I, I couldn't come out. I, I won't do any spoilers for people who are, it's same, same. I really enjoyed it. It's certainly not the direction I'd have gone with with their Mysterio, but it, they committed to the direction and there are certain scenes in that film involving Mysterio that I was grinning ear to ear from as a well-noted huge Mysterio fan. The effects and the certain sequences, I was like, this is what, this is all I needed. So what you're saying is people can take beloved characters and put them in a different direction. We're not used to and you don't have to shit your nappy over it. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, absolutely not the direction I'd have gone in, not one I was hoping to see. I didn't get what I hoped to see out of Mysterio, but I still got a very entertaining Mysterio with Jake Gellinhall doing a really fine performance with a really interesting motivation for the character and I'm like, okay, I'm on board. The moment, like the film started with, like, like an open showing off some Mysterio action and I was, I just in was with me and he, he just went and padded me on the shoulder with this sort of, I'm happy for you. While I was just there just going, it was such a just well-paced fun film that like, after the quite somber stuff that was endgame where it was everything was very sort of drum and drab and the end of an era, this was like a really interesting direction not only for like, okay, this is our next big arc how we're setting that direction off and for what they're doing with Spider-Man but yeah, Jake Gellinhall did a real good job of Mysterio. I, I was not sold on him as an actor. I thought I would be distracted by the, oh it's the big Hollywood, handsome face man. I thought that would distract me too much, not at all. No, he was great. I can't see him as anything but Donnie Darko, even in like watching Jar Head, I'm like, that's Donnie Darko. I tell you what, he was really good in Velvet Buzzsaw. It's the Netflix original film. It's not a film I loved. I watched it once. I'll probably never watch it again but his character in Velvet Buzzsaw was very good, very not the kind of character I think many would associate with him as a performer. So I love seeing actors who are known and thought of as one thing, going out of their way to do something different. Like Bruce Willis and Death Becomes, that was one of the earliest times I was impressed with an actor going outside of their usual. Hodson, Hodson, Hark as well. I think the Jake Dylanhall's casting was really smart just because like the kind of person he is as an actor and that we see him as already is exactly the kind of person that they made his character in his version of Mysterio. Like he had to be the swavv person that people immediately go, oh that's the, that's a handsome, handsome good boy. It was a good film. It was great. And I mean, I'd already seen trailers and everything of course and I'd already got my little fucking Mysterio action figure in because I'm a mark for merchandise of a big fishball headed weirdo. But to see it on the screen, in all its glory, that faithful, the fishball and everything, I was like, this is, this is great. I wasn't even like, I didn't think the plot was the, it was really that surprising. Like there weren't many things I didn't sort of see coming from the offset. Like if you know even the basics about Mysterio, you'll probably be able to guess where the plot is going. But like, I didn't care. It was a great journey to get there. Yeah. It was the bits that, there were bits that dragged a little and you know, not everything hit the way it should, but pretty much everything they did that was good was very, very, very good. And then yeah, the, the effects were really nice in this one and, and served a real purpose instead of just being, you know, wankery from studio budgets and, and art teams and whatnot. Oh, I got my Mysterio film. I got my Mysterio film. That makes up for me thinking Starscream was going to be in the Bumblebee film, but instead it was Blitzwing who they just made look like Starscream for no reason. Yeah. I'm glad you got your Mysterio film. I'm glad you're happy with it. Yeah. I got one editor with the things I'm a Mark IV being in films. And it's not, it's very unusual. Like, there's a lot of things I like and I like to see adaptations of things I like. But I'm such a big fan of Mysterio. I'm like, this must be how like, proper full on hardcore comic book fans must feel all the time. I was that delighted and elated to finally see Mysterio up there. Brilliant. The only time I can remember feeling that was during Lord of the Rings is the only time I can remember a movie really, really living up to the, the height that I had put onto it. Mm-hmm. They are excellent films. Still, I still every now and then make the set some time aside to rewatch them. Oh, yeah. They're, they're master classes in, in just cinematography and acting and... And my boy, Brad Deriffs, in there. Yes. So he's so excellent as well, I'm tongue. Take notes to certain other people. That is how you end an epic saga. Good times, good times, hats by everyone. Yeah. Is it's been a good, good time? Yeah. Well, how do you want to talk about now? Yeah. I haven't seen your video on Sea of Solitude, Jim. But so I don't know what you think about it, but I really liked this one. I thought it was great. Yeah. Although it was pretty good. Although it was decent. It was decent. A little on the nose for my taste. That's so funny that it's exactly my one, that's my one thing I didn't like about it. Was I found both the voice acting and the writing were a little goofy and on the nose at times. Yeah, it's about as subtle as hammers at times. Yeah. Is that the moment you see a monster that sounds and looks like a protagonist called the protagonist a piece of shit? Like, which happens right at the beginning? I'm like, oh, okay. Now I know exactly where this game is going. And it went there. I feel like maybe with a different voice actors though, they could have made that writing work. I do something. I don't know. I thought maybe I'm just being racist and I think German sounds goofy when people speak English and German. It might be. You might be going on a little bit Brexit. A little bit Tory honest. Yeah. I'm going over to like make a sign for like, you know, Boris Johnson's going to stop us having like German people in our video game. Boris Johnson's going to stop everything from happening because the world will collapse around his weird head. Imagine how we feel. Yeah. We've got drawn to the left of us. Bars to the right here. We are stuck in the middle in the EU. Right. So, see of solitude. I liked it. I didn't love it. I will never go back to play it again. But I don't regret having played it the first time. It's definitely a one time, where yet. And I won't go back to it either. But I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing. No. If I were to praise something though, like wholeheartedly, it would be the audio visual stuff. The music is delightful. And the monster designs I found incredible. Everything sort of stylistically tied in with this sort of black oily appearance with these glowing red eyes. But there's like a monster chameleon and a monster like Gorgon like creature. And they all looked wildly different, but all unified by certain stylistic coherences. And I absolutely loved every monster design in that game. Yeah. I love the visual design, especially the environments, the, and particularly when it, like in the game, it's kind of this dark stormy weather. And what you do is you go around and find light to light it up again. And when the city lights up and you get those beautiful oranges and blues and reds, and it just is such a gorgeous sight to behold. Yeah. It's a game that uses its visuals to really cement a tone. Yeah. At no point, I mean, this is where the uns<|tr|> subtlety does work a little in its favor because at no point do you feel like the game's ambiguous about how the world is feeling and how the character is feeling. The visuals and the sounds set that up perfectly. A clever use of visuals as metaphor as well because every time the sea rises or every time the sea parts and you go further down into the sea bed, you're you're delving into memories from longer ago and deeper down repressed memories and stuff. And then you get these gorgeous vistas where you're on the sea bed, but there are kind of cliffs of waves all around you. And it's just really, it's just a really nice game to look at. Yeah. Audio visual I've got no issue with. Gameplay is a mix bag. It's like got very rudimentary puzzle platforming. And I mean very rudimentary. And the saying could be said for stealth to the point where I hesitate to even call it stealth. It's more just like, keep away. It's games are keep away, either with you as the protagonist keeping yourself away or holding something to keep it away. I found those but it was clunky all right where you have to grab the thing and run away. That was, it was it just me or did the things chasing you sometimes feel arbitrarily quicker than you and others just did not. Yeah, it was weird. I couldn't tell what I had done wrong when they caught me and I couldn't tell what I had done right when they didn't. Yes. I don't even know if this is if this is superstition on my part or if it mechanically worked, but I found that jumping instead of running just jump, jump, jump, jump, got me through those bits where simply trying to run did not. But in any case, I mean I got through it. I finished the game last night. And I liked it. Yeah, I liked it. I didn't love it. But then some of the criticism I had about Gris last year could be shared with this in that the game itself doesn't necessarily do a lot wrong. It's just I've seen so many games tackle these themes now. Many of which have been more exceptional in doing so. Maybe the fact that I don't play many of these kinds of games is why I liked like Gris and this a little bit more than it may be so. Yeah, no criticism exists in a bubble. So I've had this come up with open world games as well where I've gotten sick of them and survival games. I've gotten sick of these genres often a lot quicker than others. And after spending a week playing Bloodstained in which the platforming in my opinion is order Balox. It was nice to have some easy easy platforming. Yeah, see I don't agree there but some seriously I love I love that game at the platforming I just find it really really annoying especially the bits where it goes into this fake 3d and you're trying to figure out the perspective and stuff. Huh. Yeah. People are going to give you to be so mad that I criticize that game. I mean I've got no argument. It feels to you how it feels to you. It's a bloody fantastic game. I just can't stand the platforming. I don't mind the moment it's just when you have to do precise jumps it always feels like just a little bit off to me but you know that's just me. I can historically I can understand what you mean. I didn't feel it with this one but the DNA this game has coming from Castlevania. Yeah. The bell months can't jump for shit. There should be a follow-up to white men can't jump. Simply called bell months can't jump because jumping in Castlevania has always been for shit. Yeah, I'm probably just spoiled from other easier like because you know the way Mario if you jump just after you've gone off the edge he'll still jump but in this game that doesn't happen and you just fall. Yeah, can't say I had that issue. So basically what I'm saying is I suck. I suck and every game developer should be forced to cater to my suckage. It should be a law. When I'm president that will be the law. All games will have a stupid easy mode for me. Especially secure. The true hardcore gamers will not like that but it will keep him yelling business. I will back you up on that. Give all the games stupid easy modes for for for for both of us. Yeah, I'll join you in playing stupid easy mode. Yeah, nice very nice little game and despite how goofy and on the nose it was at times I did towards the end I felt quite affected by the story especially the relationship with the mother and father I thought was done well and the way it wrapped up as well I thought was really cool and really nice and I think yeah it's definitely worth checking out if you like those kind of games. Yeah, someone said to me that they they thought I would have been a lot harsh around it if it wasn't about mental health issues which is a weird guess that someone made but then again someone on Facebook said oh I swear they could slap that it's about mental health on the front of slaughtering grounds and you'd say it was the best game ever made. Clearly came from someone who didn't watch my video because my video was mostly criticism and towards the end I started talking about Jason lives. You know I feel like I feel like it was about maybe about mental health kind of in a different way than other like gris to me seemed like a metaphor for depression but this game was more about kind of um it was you know it was about relationships and learning how how to let go of them and stuff like that I wouldn't I wouldn't strictly call it a mental health story at home. I would say it's it the mental health issue because they say themselves in promotion that it's a game predominantly about loneliness that's the time that keeps coming up. Yeah. I think the mental health issues of loneliness and isolation and depression that do come up kind of weave throughout and then it hits these bigger themes along the way of communication, family relationships, romantic relationships. The biggest takeaway from me was communication was people talking to each other, knowing when not to talk to each other and knowing you know how to approach each other's problems and be considerate of others and what they need while at the same time understanding that you have needs as well and I thought all the themes within them were very resonant with me. I think it's just there was something about the way the game presented it with that hammer approach that just took me out of it a little um but it's certainly not a game I could not understand others being very deeply affected by. But people watch videos before you comment on them. Please fucking say that I would call it the best game ever or that I wouldn't criticize the game even though the video was full of criticisms just like the other person the other day when I did that video about um the kids cleaning out their family's bank account because they spent money on FIFA. Oh yeah. And someone replies with well shouldn't the parents say responsibility? Clearly you didn't watch the fucking video because I talked about the bit where the father took response a fucking billety. Uh fun fun thing about loot boxes that I'm going to be writing about this week. Uh so I interviewed the people behind roblox that very popular sort of blocky game for kids a while back and like one of my big things was like how do you like responsibly sell stuff to kids and they were like hey no loot boxes because you probably shouldn't sell them to kids. I got very surprised this week when I saw an update where it's like uh roblox here's our transparency about if you're having loot boxes in your roblox game you've got to make sure you that the percentages are publicly visible or suddenly went oh my I thought you said you weren't gonna have those in there because that's bad for kids. I got issue with that anyway I mean roblox has always been a little bit sinister from what I've seen everything I've seen about the way it monetizes seems insidious but we've got to be careful about what they try to pull on you that first time even without them obviously adding or or having loot boxes and hiding it. Yeah even before that I've warned people about this in many gym positions this moving of the goalposts. Yeah just because you don't have loot boxes doesn't mean you're ethical. Many micro transactions are not that's something in that addictive cost video I made that I tried to stress it's not just about the gambling that's worse but the micro transactions themselves are manipulative and often predatorate. To to be clear they they also did talk about about um not wanting micro transactions that could be seen as predatory because of that nature that they've got a child based audience but loot boxes specifically they said that that is a thing that they will not have in that game and then suddenly yeah I saw a post about how they're gonna monitor how loot boxes are used so I'm digging into that this week to basically go so what the fuck of the stuff that you told me was lies and what actually is in here for your monetization of kids huh. Please do and let me know when that goes out I'd be very interested in that. I will let you know like my week is just going hey so at least one thing you told me is a lie how are you marketing your micro transactions to kids huh. Yeah. Oh I mean god damn I let this just briefly touch on on their FIFA story. Yeah. Basically a family with four kids all under the age of ten had their dad buy them one pack for FIFA ultimate team one loot box basically um what he didn't know is they saw exactly how he did it when he did it for them and he didn't think to like put protection on the account um credit card stuff to stop them using it. Yeah. And they kept using it here and there trying to get their favorite player um eventually emptying the bank account get them 550 pounds in the hole and EA's response when the BBC asked them about this was to just not leave a comment but to send them community uh not community guidelines spending guidelines of how to limit spending uh and stop kids doing this at which point in lieu of EA giving a real fucking valid excuse we have to now admit FIFA isn't for kids and should not be right to do for everyone should not be rated three and up because if you need to offer spending guidelines and cautions for how to monitor your kids in that game that makes it no different from an emrated game in my opinion. Yeah and at the very least the micro transactions should be age gays it. Yes. They should be age gated um protection should be built into the games because it hits the thing it's obvious to us that kid should be monitored playing a game like FIFA within city as mic transactions but we follow the industry people who listen to this podcast people who watch my videos are a lot closer to the industry than some average parent on the street to whom the concept is probably really abstract you're like oh what I bought this game from a digital storefront and downloaded it or I bought it from a high street and brought it home but the game itself has a store inside it with random chance purchases in it that you just buy over and over that's weird to me it seems just as obvious as it is to us that loot bucks is and things should be monitored. It seems equally obvious to me that most parents would not think of such a weird abstract stupid concept in their ages three and up game. Yeah that is 100% yeah because it's fucking gambling and if you want to sell fucking gambling to people it should be fucking gated like fucking gambling. Even the comparison to like sticker albums is just a bad one because at least with those you own it and at least you can steal that. Not only that you give a kid five bucks they go in there they buy their sticker packs they don't have unlimited access to them. We used to just steal stickers when we were kids we'd go in and steal like six packets and you'd eventually get what you want and then we got cars. Old nail foot strikes again stealing his Panini stickers. If it's not if it's not rip and sink so to pub walls it's stealing stickers. Old nail foot strikes again. You're just you're just you're just a proper hard, cockly criminal yeah. Yeah, no one will be crying. Oh, the little bit tasty. I do it all be crying. Oh dear. Bathroom, sinks and Panini sticker albums. They're my stock and thread. Yeah well now now I'm the like annoyed like angry dad who like looks out his window when this teenager is making noise outside so my my worst nightmare is to live next to teenage me. Ah, we create the we create our own hell, our own ironic hell here on this earth. But this story absolutely in my opinion torpedoes EA's insistence that what they do is exactly like sticker albums because I've never seen a kid. Yeah, I've never seen a kid clean their barrens his bank account out trying to buy Panini stickers. Yeah, maybe someone's done it. I've not fucking seen it because like I said a moment ago give a kid five dollars send them into a shop and they'll come out with their stickers or whatever they fucking spent the money on. If you forget to protect your children from the video game you bought them to have fun with they might ban crop chips. Yeah, that's a very different scenario from fucking stickers or bugs. It's it's it's just totally different scales. Yeah, so yeah I'm gonna die now on this story forever. Personally I would never allow my kids access to my credit cards if I had kids which I don't thankfully. But that again you're you're you're enough of an adult to realize you're plugged enough into the games industry to realize if you put your credit card into the games console to buy the game then it stays on the games console in order to buy further in game purchases. Like the it just highlights exactly how these mic transactions how this monetization is designed to suck a people on top of you know the way it plays on people who are adults who still don't get to fully appreciate how much money they've spent because they're microtransactions they're little they're tiny that's what makes them so fucking nasty. On on the nicer end of games I did play a game this week that is just a video game that comes out and you play the video game. What? And there are no additional things involved you just buy the video game. What fucking mayhem is this? I know right what what world am I living in? What was it? Manamadan. That one from the until dawn people. Oh yes um you tell people a bit bit more than madame because I just got a status update on a delivery so I'm gonna I'm gonna go grab that before it gets nicked off my fucking stoop. Oh quick go get that go get that I'm excited I'm excited for you yeah no I'm just gonna thank for a second because I think Chips got a more here about it as well but uh the the basics man of madame it's the new game by super massive who the people who made until dawn yeah yeah so it's it's basically you know how until dawn was now eight to ten hour long horror game you make choices a bunch of teens in a cabin in the woods and spooky monsters in the woods chasing them yeah this is that but it's about four to five hours long it's a much shorter thing and it's about a ghost ship bunch of teens go out on a on a boat they're like hey let's go diving go look through some like military plane that sunk in the ocean and not tell anyone that we found it because you're probably supposed to tell people about these things uh let's just let's take some souvenirs with us oops there's a ghost ship now we're fucked I can imagine a shorter experience soothing this type of game yeah this this is the thing like I've played maybe the first 90 minutes of it which was basically from the start of the game up to where the ghost ship happens and I think the pacing really helped it um it definitely seems like it branches a bit more than until dawn did at least like it starts branching earlier which is really nice because obviously like because it's not so long a game they're like ah we can do all our branching you know with more of a pace yeah the big the two things about this that are like important to know compared to one till dawn you know that hold the controller still to not you know to stay calm mechanic that's broken it's gone yes you want to know what they replaced it with you have to bash it off your face really fast it's it's a button-based prompt now uh it'll be like oh it's tense and you'll start hearing your heartbeat and there'll be official indicator on screen and you basically just have to press a button in time with your heartbeat to stay calm otherwise yeah so that's more reliable than a motion control thing it's an actual button that you press in time with your TV it's fine um the only other big difference is there's multiplayer oh dear no I'm actually kind of into it so the whole game has co-op and that there are basically two forms of co-op one if you're sat around with your friends in your living room and you know it's four or five hours you could probably play this in a sitting yeah you put your names in you divvy up the characters so I'll play this one I'll play as this one and the game will just tell you when to pass the controller round and each of you will take control of your characters and you'll play through the game together oh that's so cool yeah it's basically what people were doing already like people were just passing the controller back and forth while they played um they minimize like there's a few slightly fewer choices if you do it that way basically to avoid you having to pass the controller too often so some of the things like the cat at the NPCs will just make choices on their own occasionally but like let's say there's five of you playing you each get one of the one of the five playable characters and if they they die that's your character dead and the others play on and you know you shout your friends tell them what to do it's basically just what people already did just made into a mode fair enough the other mode is the one I'm really interested in there's an online two-player co-op version where sometimes you know how in until dawn sometimes the party would split and two people go do one thing and at the same time two people would go do something else yeah in this if two scenes are happening simultaneously one player will control one scene the other player will control the other scene you won't see what the other player is doing until you converge back together and suddenly it's like oh shit what what's going on would it arm this um so like the example in the demo that I played was um early on the party split so like two characters went diving in this this ship that was under the ocean and two play two characters stayed up on the boat up top and interacted with some pirates like I think some pirates um set the boat on fire a little bit and they like threw money at them to make them go away so I come up to the surface and like the boat is partially on fire and there's dollar bills floating in the water and the other the other player was just like no nothing happened everything's fine and like was just stonewalling me I was like I have no clue what the fuck's come on here I'm no experts on um piracy yeah but throwing money at them to make them go away yeah oh no it totally didn't it totally didn't work in their favor um they were like oh you've got money to throw around so five minutes later they came back and held everyone at gunpoint um but like that that was kind of interesting that there was a whole scene going on where I was like I don't know what happened and the other player has chosen to keep it a secret because they're like oops I fucked up I'm not gonna tell you that I fucked up uh I found that really interesting it it it was a different way to go through that kind of experience but yeah basically it's more until dawn but about a ghost ship and a bit shorter and that's all I really wanted man of madame to be yeah it's just more of the thing that was already good none of that holding the controller in place prompt and multiplayer if you want it but it doesn't really take away from the single player yeah I'm looking forward to this one it's gonna be good I'd say yeah when's it out uh end of August so like it's not far off yeah so I'm unexcited for that one have we got Jim back the usps has a very funny definition of the word delivered uh was it not not there I don't fucking see anything there's gonna be fun calls made all personal appearances are the fucking post office made if I do not see this package to fucking day have they just marked it as delivered because it was supposed to be before reset and time and that time has happened and they don't want to get in trouble I'm having that feeling yeah they've got another five minutes before it's officially late good luck and I do not fucking see anything and I already I already have a certain level of cynicism towards the United States Postal Service I've got extra cynicism for the local United States Postal Office considering how bad things go fucking missing that are marked as fucking delivered yeah if they fucked this one up this is this is the one this is my fucking wrestling fucking reday view that I have had plans since friggin December December last year if they if if it's fallen at the final fucking furlong because of fucking usps I'm gonna kick off sorry but I'm I'm gonna kick off that's so that's all right do you feel better getting that system a little bit oh there they're there are recriminations to be had you got any questions about that man of my dad so I picked up someone you're saying um so I caught you saying a little bit about co-op then I went to go and check the door again to make sure that my eyes did not deceive me the short version occasionally if there's the part the the party of characters splits and there's two scenes happening at the same time one player will do one scene at the same time the other player does the other scene you'll come back together and you may not have all of the information of what the other player did hmm to sort of sow some doubt between between members of the party because it's like I don't know what choices you made and why the the fuck you doing you miss mysterious fuck that's interesting I remember Ken and Lynch doing interesting things with co-op where one person played a character with with delusions that made them behave erratically yeah so the other player was like what the fuck are you doing I'm always interested in ideas like that yeah so like for example on this like the first time this happened in the demo um I made a choice to rush up to the surface of the water from scuba diving without waiting to decompress and I'm pretty sure later in that game that that means I'm gonna start suffering from the bends and I'm gonna not be able to get through a quick time sequence properly but the rest of the party don't know that so they might rely on me at a crucial moment it's like oh sorry I rushed to the top of the water you're fucked interesting I find things like that interesting choices but they don't seem to be at the detriment of it being a single player game if you just want to play it single player in a single narrative it's basically just more until dawn but it goes ship and I'm really into that excellent see yeah I'm just getting flashbacks to when I played Gears of War on insane with gray online and I would dread I would dread the parts where you'd get split up because he would just keep running into the fucking locus fire and I wasn't there to revive him over and over and over yeah just like just like playing with the actual Dom AI in Gears of War yeah I'm looking forward to the party splitting in Man of Medan and then it comes back together it's like oh no they killed off three of the five players done a how they're all dead lovely what's everyone else played this week I played lots of new Vegas yeah I get on with new Vegas just reminded of what a absolutely wonderful and absolutely terrible game it is it's one of the greatest stories and writing and acting ever put into a video game but the fucking bugs like all these years later let me tell you about a funny bug I had today right right so I'm idolized by the NCR which is like for anyone who hasn't played this game there's like a faction system in this where you do favors for factions and they like you or hate you depending on what you do and who you piss off so I'm completely idolized by this one faction and I go into their base to turn in a mission and completely out of the blue one of their soldiers police dudes just turns on means like you should have paid the toll when you had a chance nobody fucks with the NCR and the whole building turns on me and I'm like what's going on here so I shoot up the building try and remember did I offend this person at any point looking up on the internet no it's a bug so I said well fuck that I'm going to reload a save when I reloaded the old save from like two hours previous because I stupidly had saved over my other ones because I didn't know this would happen because apparently the game had licked my reputation from idolized to hate it oh yeah it makes sense yeah so suddenly they all hated me so anyway reloaded a two-hour old save did your character say something on Twitter maybe so reloaded a two-hour old save went to do different things instead said I'll just hope for the best so anyway playing away that like hours hours later I'm wondering around free side I start hearing gunshots I run up to follow them and there's that weird looking fucking NCR glitchy police man in a fight with mr house's robots in a completely different area of the world and they kill him and it's just like this game is and that's only like that's only like the tip of the fucking iceberg there are so many broken quests in this game I'm just like oh yeah I love it I love that game but yeah every fun and I'm like I don't know how much like every half-hour it crashes and it crashed so bad at one point I had to read like it crashed my entire computer I couldn't out-tab I would or I couldn't do task manager or anything it crashes so bad it actually crashes your computer but you know what yeah keep on playing because it's just so god done good it's worth it it's worth pushing through it really is that story is so good and like I wish more games would do a faction system like that where instead of a binary morality thing there's this faction likes you because of the thing you did and this faction's pissed off at you because of the thing you did um follow it for a try to do it but really drop the ball um I played a bit of a shit game this week that was a bit disappointing I played the the new mobile phone version of dr mario does super dr mario world or whatever it's called it's it's it's it's like all shitty mobile puzzle games like you're sort of fucking candy crush and shit like that in that you get limited number of plays per day without paying real world money and the puzzles are deliberately designed to be near impossible to do so that you'll run out of moves and then pay for extra moves so that you can finish the puzzle it's like ah you failed the puzzle but you can finish it if you just cheat and get a couple of extra moves yeah I'm surprised Nintendo put out something like that yeah their their mobile monetization has been really disappointing um it's also not great just in terms of being a dr mario game uh if you've played dr mario or similar games like tetris and things like that the whole tension is you've got the piece and it's falling down and you've got a limited amount of time to get it into place and rotate it and put it where you want it on this you just drag it where you want it like you don't have to do it like you know before the time runs out and it hits the pot you just drag and drop it where you want it which takes away half of the challenge of a game like that it's in it's another just kind of disappointing mobile game from Nintendo the only mobile game I ever tried was fallet shelter and five minutes of that was enough to know I don't like fallet shelter yeah I tried angry birds as well that was kind of fun anger birds is honestly not bad for all the reputation it has it's not bad yeah it's fun for like five minutes exactly which is all it really needs to be yeah um couple of bits and news we got this week um g2a those those people that that's resale game keys they've not had a good week a bunch of indie developers got together and basically said hey we'd rather you steal our games than buy them on g2a because quite often keys on g2a are bought using stolen credit cards and those then get charged back with a fee to the developer to refund the person who was stolen from and basically if you steal from an indie developer they get no money if you buy from g2a you might cost them money so indie devs will like no don't buy from g2a just don't do it and in response someone at g2a emailed 10 different media outlets asking them to publish undisclosed advertorial about uh and this is g2a's headline not you know not any hyperbole how it's practically impossible to purchase stolen game keys they blamed it on like oh someone at the company did it and we we don't know who or why and and and we will make sure they're certainly reprimanded but no further details sorry it really seems like they just tried to cover their own arseys i'm probably making this the next gym position it deserves to be oh yeah i've done a couple videos on their fuck ups from last week um i will say right now and i'm gonna talk about it too much just because i'm still saving up and i'm still collecting some thoughts and stuff for the video but uh i won't say they're lying when they said this was some rogue agent yeah but i you know i don't want to be sued for libel again but i will say it is my personal belief that i do not fucking believe it yeah and if i were to say i did i would also have to say that g2a oh they're dumb as bunch of fucks i know i would say my personal belief is that i think it's i personally think it's unlikely that someone at g2a had access to a database of journalist emails took the time out of their workday to write an entire advertorial article that they wanted published to write an accompanying email of you know asking for that that that to be published and ascended out to the press with absolutely nobody catching wind that that's what they'd spent their day doing yeah and to not think that they needed permission from someone to sign off on doing it i i find it personally hard to believe that that just accidentally happened to no one caught wind of it yeah it strikes me as beyond unlikely yeah that any company with with any claim to professionalism would allow some then again it's unlikely that any company with a claim to professionalism would have done this in the first place yeah it's i i struggle to picture how their version of events could have occurred yes but equally either that version of events you know could occur well yeah even i don't know i don't understand how any company lets this happen yeah either way whether they did this as a fully corporate approved email or if it was a rogue agent both make g2a look incredibly stupid yeah incredibly stupid it's the kind of thing where you look at g2a and you see how much damage has had on the market how no inti dev i know has ever had a good thing to say about them whether they're a veteran inti dev or not you look at the how damaging they've been and this is while they're wildly incompetent if they knew what they were doing they'd be so fucking dangerous yeah it's almost a saving grace that they are as clearly inept as they are yeah they make the theft a little bit they're on the fucking bowl they make Konami look like they've got their head in their game yeah it's quite something and i i'm just dumbfounded by this story existing yeah this is a company that's dumb business or digital homicide that's how clueed in and good at what they do they are yeah fucking g2a are the g2a are the pit yeah i can't wait to go off on them again i'm excited to see it happen i'd love to be able to do it with my new mask that i'll be able to show up if it turns up if it's not been stolen like everything else fucking hope not fucking i'm i'm the moment we're done here i'm guessing on the fucking phone good good luck let me know when you find out what happened because i am i am holding my breath on this one but uh i'll be sending you a picture as soon as i guess i see and if i fucking get it in yes please last bit news we had this week was uh it's finally official that there's a switch light happening yes it's a it's it's a bit smaller it's screen has gone from like six point two inches to i think five point five it's got a slightly better battery life the the joy cons are built into it it doesn't work with the dock you physically cannot dock it um it's basically a handheld portable only version of the switch it's basically a hundred pound or a hundred dollars less joy cons gaff doesn't like the word joy con nasty filthy joy conses um i think the only the other only other notable difference about it is it's got a deep pad rather than four separate buttons on the left hand side and there's a cute yellow color available oh the turquoise one i want i i hate the the functionality of this is not what i want but i want that turquoise one please yeah this is like malibu stacey with a new hat it's like you show me a cute little color on one of them and then i'm like yeah oh but maybe i could justify somehow even though i really can't i i've been i've been spending today working out like how do i justify this as a as a as a thing because i can't get rid of my existing switch because i need it for video capture i tell you what it would be easier to fucking justify if Nintendo had a more reliable way to transfer data or consistent cloud saving because then i'm like all right i'll have the old one in the dark and then i'll have my cute little yellow one that i can have at my side at all times yeah but i never know what you can easily or if you can even easily well easily is not what you could never easily do something with Nintendo yeah i never know what could be guaranteed transferred whether there's a if there was any kind of seamless experience guaranteed between consoles i'd be on board with this but it's Nintendo and mmm hmm i'm i'm thinking about like one of the games that i would want to play handheld often enough that i would justify like a small little one that's easier to travel around with i'm like animal crossing that's not gonna have cloud saves pokemon not gonna have cloud saves like the stuff that i would want this for doesn't support cloud saves yeah that's what that's where they talk themselves out of yeah me being interested in it i've seen some people try and say this is more for like the 2ds crowd people that like like to the 2ds but i don't even think that's true like especially when you're promising better battery life and share here's here's the thing i think there is a uh market that this exists for um ignoring the fact that it's called the switch but it doesn't switch between handheld and portable that's a branding nightmare but um it's gonna cost about was it $200 about 180 pound that is much much much closer to what people expect out of a high end games handheld like if if a middle a middle class family wants to get their their teenage kid a kind of slightly expensive gaming Christmas present that's probably a much easier ask like under 200 pounds is much closer to something that will shift lots of units at Christmas i get that um i get that there are families that would feel a lot more confident buying this for their kid because it's one solid piece of plastic not a thing with separate controllers that can get lost and snapped off and whatnot i think like if i was on a budget i wouldn't even mind getting this because i 99% of the time play the switch as a handheld anyway like i don't dock it often but like there are people this is for there's not enough to justify me getting it when i already own a switch but the leaks about this months and months ago also said there's a pro coming so i'll probably just wait and see what the pro is yeah because now that we know the switch light exists it's like oh okay the switch pro clearly is real as well and we're gonna appear about that soon yeah i think i'll hold on if it if it weren't for cloud-safe things i could be tempted to have one especially because i'm doing a lot more traveling soon so having an even more portable version would be nice but you'd like you say like the games i'd be most interested in having cloud-safe so i could do some transferious stuff i can't do it yeah so we'll see how the pro does even then there'll be issues with the pro like can i get my saves on one from one thing to another you never know with the intent yeah like i know no cloud-safe but can i manually move like my memory card to move saves over yeah it'd be nice to know if i can't move my if there is zero way to move my pokemon saves from my main switch to the put the switch light i think short of actually transferring all ownership over there is no reason for me to have this thing yeah like i need to be able to move my pokemon save back and forth somehow or it's pointless and it would damage the sales prospect of a pro as well like yeah if it turns out certain things i cannot bring over you will be able to bring them over like full stop like let's say there's a hypothetical pro and you're like i want to get rid of the old switch just have the pro there is a thing that will just move all of your licenses all of your games just transfer everything over okay i never know with an intender like you can transfer all your stuff over onto a new system but it's not a case of like i just want to transfer this one save got your thirdo so yeah i don't know yeah i like it's there's a cute yellow one it's it is also why i like the the play date that little console with the crank because also it is cute and little in yellow yeah i want the little blue one intender give me a little blue one because i can't justify buying one god damn but i want the little blue ones because it looked really cute fucking capitol isn't it knows exactly how to get to you just give me a regular switch blue yeah don't don't make me have nice blue controllers and a stupid black console in the middle that's not matching the color scheme ourselves yeah and also give me a god damn fucking separate charger for the controller when i buy it because it's annoying having to use the same thing to charge the the switch and the controller because i always forget to do one of them so i never play my switch uh got anything else we want to talk about this week um i'm good i think i've gone through what i need to talk about i think i got everything out my system yeah i've got fucking calls to make i beat that bus in in bloodstein finally the ninja sword dude yeah and uh got got much much further into it and we've been enjoying it a lot you two were right about that one yeah yeah it's still probably my my top game of the year contender right now when you unlock the double jump as well to complete game changer oh yeah you just wait till you get the thing that makes you move fast it's a kind of thing where i'm like why why didn't i get this why wasn't this available hours beforehand what was the game in recent memory in which the swimming vets were actually the most fun part i'm trying to remember oh it was gris oh yeah well i will get us concluded so that i can go yellow people who's fault it probably isn't um i'm not really a yellow but i come close when it comes to dealing with the post office but Laura can you tell people about things that they can see that you have done and will do and will do again forever yeah me what stuff do um yeah Laura k bus twitter twitch youtube uh you can find me on

      "text": "We have before us the opportunity to forge for ourselves and for future generations. A new world over. Europe is doomed, we're told. High migration, low birth rates, low levels of innovation, incompetent politicians and high energy prices are leading to de-industrialization, social unrest and political instability. No where is this narrative more prominent than in Europe's erstwhile powerhouse and bastion of political maturity, Germany. But Anglosphere reporting of Europe has never been great. So what's really happening? Can we expect a slow death, political shocks or a shocking recovery? To discuss this today we have Philip Matthias, a German journalist and author. Philip has more than 20 years experience as a journalist for word shaft worker based in Germany and as a foreign correspondent in East Asia, China and Turkey. The author of several books from novels to investigative nonfiction, there are a few better people to discuss the decline of Europe. Philip, welcome to Multi-Polarity. Very nice to meet you, my big fan of your podcast and I feel very on the next side of it to be here. I hope I can help out with my underground wisdom from Germany. Germany's been on a certain track now as the lead economic force in Europe, obviously. It was the economic force and Paris was supposed to be the diplomatic and sort of military force. There was a kind of a consistent plan around that. A lot of politicians kind of stitched that framework together and within Germany itself, my understanding at least as an outsider, is that the national pride was sunk into the fact that it was a manufacturing and economic giant. So maybe you can give us a brief history. However you think you should start, whatever you think is relevant and explain to us how we got here at least. OK, so make a very quick overview of the German history. You know that like in Western Germany at least after the Second World War, the industry boomed and it came like one of the most successful economic nations in the world. You can still see that finally with the gold reserves, before the end of the gold standard, Germany gathered a lot of gold. It still have like I think the third or fourth largest gold reserves because the exports were so successful and so huge that back then it was basically paid in gold until 1971. So it gives you a kind of an idea of how rich and how successful German industry was. And that basically lasted until 1989 until the Wende came when the Berlin Wall came down. And then of course it was a huge burden for Western Germany to overtake the East because it took a lot of like infrastructure investment and dismantling the old communist socialist factories and everything. So it was like a German like Kraftakt. So it took a lot of power and energy and especially money to do that. And that definitely worked I would say. I think now if you drive or travel to Eastern Germany you don't see a difference anymore when it comes to infrastructure or something like that. And then like basically then Germany or Germany industry needed new markets and they got this with the European Union and they got it with China. And I think this lasted. It's interesting to define a point when things really got downhill and led to the point where we are now. But I would say when you know think back on the years of Merkel, I mean a lot of mistakes were done by Merkel. But now with insight you would say like, oh hey this was kind of a golden age. She was ruling from 2003 to 2021. She was a long-erst chancellor in the history of the Bundeslaububliq. And this was basically a very lucky and successful time for Germany. Because industry was exporting a lot into the European Union but also to China. Everything was kind of booming I would say. I mean there were problems of course but like in general GDP went up and the wealth was somehow shared of Feli and the trade unions were happy. And the political system started to have some cracks around 2012, 2013. There was a Euro crisis with Greece and that's actually also the birth point when the AfD, the Argentine football tournament became a party. They started as an anti-Europe party basically as a sound money party. And then they were overtaking by more right-wing extreme people. And then I think later on as a second change became a snow they're about to become like a people's party again right. We can just discuss this later how this happened and how how founded this is. But nowadays like in many Bundesland they have a majority especially the East. And so what's that like 2011 was a was a turning point when the the AfD was founded. Another big turning point was the Fl\u00fcchtlingskrieg then 2015 and Merkel opened the borders and let about 300,000 people in. But I think like the biggest turning point was I think we're recently it was when the Green Party became to power and started to push their energy and their economic reforms through the agenda. And of course then it was the Ukraine war with basically the cutoff Germany from Cheap Energy. And I would say like these are the most important stepping point of stepping stones and came like back into detail later. But like this would be like the timeline and what we see now is like the first result of these maybe Elgate policies. So like the sea was planted during Merkel the regime during Merkel rule and everything was like exacerbated or yeah it came really into effect when the Green Party got into power I would say. So Philip I look back and I really see that as you say there was a golden era under Merkel. And I'm less certain that that was from an outsider's perspective. I'm less certain that that was due to any great statemanship or brilliant policy from Angela Merkel herself. So much as some of the things that had happened before her reign just after the turn of the millennium. So at the turn of the millennium you had the introduction of the euro and the euro zone which meant that the euro itself was valued at a lower level than the Deutsche Mark would have which gave German industry a competitive advantage. It was essentially like some sort of de facto currency manipulation from the German perspective. You also had the hearts labor reforms under Gerhard Schroeder which really helped and kind of screwed down on labor cost and make German labor more competitive. The single market was introduced earlier of course but that also gave Germany a larger and seamless marketplace. And of course you had the rise of China and it's almost insatiable demand for German products most famously Volkswagen's BMWs and Mercedes. But also some of the fantastic engineered products whether that be railway locomotives or other kind of turbines or any of the other things that companies like Siemens produce. Court to this of course was another step taken by Schroeder which I guess could be seen as a kind of extension of the kind of the aust politic that went on under Willy Brandt in the 1970s. But essentially it was to draw closer to Russia. So first of all is the potential marketplace for German goods of course Russia is the largest consumer marketplace in Europe. But also as a source for inexpensive raw materials specifically energy which of course was literally the fuel of the German industrial success story. So you had all of these things that happened before Merkel of course Nord Stream finally came online under Merkel. All of these things took place before Merkel and she kind of reap the stability and the success there. But what is it that caused what in your view is that that's caused Germany to move away from these successful policies. You know IE move away from cheap energy from Russia move away from trade with China move away to a certain degree from the kind of industrial model. You know what caused this from a policy perspective because to the outside it's like this is so good why change it in fact you would surely want to protect it for all your worth. Absolutely and I can tell you that a lot of Germans are also like squishing their hand like how did it happen and why. It's very hard to find like an overall answer but like I think a lot of like most of the stones where they and they finally coming together now I give you one example for example like the that is mentally of the nuclear plants which was like which Merkel wanted to do after the director disaster in Fukushima right. And this is something that the green party always wanted but this dates back to the 80s you know in the 80s there was like a big fear of a nuclear escalation between US and Soviet Union. And of course Germany would have been a battlefield so there was like a big. But how is that like even you have fear not not only fear but like a big huge people just did not want to have nuclear power they were very scared of everything that's nuclear and this is like a like a like a founding stone of the green party right. So when Merkel after Fukushima said like okay we gonna we gonna get out of nuclear power like the group people from the green parties the green voters were applauding so so the center party of Merkel already move closer to the green party there was like a big important thing which kind of like explains the energy mass way now right because now like I mean you maybe could have managed to green transition without nuclear power but then you need gas. And Russian gas usually because the cheapest we don't have this anymore so this this thing is like one one current that explains it right. The other one one I mean I don't want to like dive too deep into the German psyche by like for example I'm 45 years old and when I was in 1999 2000 I was backpacking through Southeast Asia and Latin America. I'm a map people I know like I was like kind of embarrassed to to say I'm German because of the past because the second world war and also like even some reactions very special from English people or so you're German happy really changed. So we did a lot of bad things back then right so this was still like it was a topic it was topic and a lot of Germans like especially in the west they feel like kind of like killed Latin but this they they felt like guilty because of what happened in the second world war. So whenever they see a chance to prove to the world that we have changed really good guys now you know they take this chance and jump they jump on it without like much considering you could see this very good like when the refugees crisis in 2015 happened you know that was a lot of Germans like cheering so like hey we we're the good guys now we're not saying for me anymore we're not you know discriminating anymore we say we're welcome. So this is like a nice humanitarian gesture but people who asked the questions like maybe maybe not the right people are coming in maybe I'm pro immigration but maybe we should choose better who's coming in. They were like easily or quickly framed us are you right wing you maybe I've did you maybe even Nazi so like this like opposition was like like shutdown very very quickly. So this one thing and then I think it also comes together with like the energy transition which which of course a lot of companies for Siemens they see big opportunities and and big. So I think it's a way to make money with the energy transition but I think it's also a little bit like hey we want to be the green guys now we don't want to pollute the environment anymore we have our technology we just make the world a better place and I think this is something that is still a bit absurd because like this is in a way it's like a trade of German mentality that has been there for the last 150 years. And which was which was perverted sometimes in history. So like this this mission to think like okay everybody has to do like us and then we're going to be a nice place and I think you you can see kind of these traits again with like the green movement and this explains why this energy transition was or still is really popular on the population. So no one is really thinking that okay is can this really work out so like no we can't do it it's going to be great and Germany and the world going to be a green and beautiful place and whenever you ask questions or wherever you doubt so like hey listen maybe we need some fossil fuels maybe they're not that bad you easy framed as someone as like I don't know it's paid by the fossil fuel industry or is a right winger or I don't know it's a I don't know it's a very good way to do it. I've been and this took interest in terms because now the I've been and the BSV that's the right. They're just addressing these people and they're like yeah if you ask questions if you're skeptical come to us we're the right party for you and indeed more and more people are asking the question is this going the right way. So this I mean this doesn't explain everything you know but like I hope I could give you some little. Most I so little little currents that work in the German spy psyche and they at some point they shape politics as well. Yeah so I mean that's pretty noticeable to an outsider as well I've seen in conservative circles recently the the kind of German. Guilt aspect is being you know related in the sense not because the past didn't happen but because it is becoming actively destructive I think a lot of people are starting to see that now also it always lays out what happens what happened in the interwar years which was actually pretty nasty on the part of the allies but. Without really getting history one of the other aspects though that you'd notice about what you might call the German psych and we don't want to go for Freud on a I don't think but you know to get a sense of the mindset I think is all right my my sense of it was always exactly what you said like German tourists on hold days were slightly bashful about being German tourists on hold days and Germans put up with English people saying you know implying that they're going to invade everybody if given half the chance. But at the same time and I think it feeds into the second thing you said there was still an innate sense of purpose and a nice sense of purpose which I think is very deeply rooted in German culture I'm quite familiar with German culture it's deeply rooted in German romantic philosophy and so on and but that to my mind I understand what you're saying that it's now gone toward this green. And that's probably been a long time coming maybe we can talk about that more shortly but what it was always married to I mean we're similar age and what it was always married to up until very recently if you're an outsider was the economic miracle the Germans that you'd meet at least from an outsider's perspective would be shameful about the past but very proud about the hyper competency engineering prowess the fact that they were the workshop of Europe they saw themselves as kind of the ones that they're going to be the most important part of the world. And I think it was saved in Europe no moral judgments on this just the ones you know we could go into whether it was sure enough but the ones that saved in Europe the ones that had all the manufacturing it was totally fair game they were more competent than than the lazy people in the safe I don't want to be mean about it but that was kind of the view now look again we don't need to re litigate the sovereign debt crisis era we don't but what's so bizarre to me is that like I thought I understood that and now they're chucking their industry down the toilet. So like have the German people just abandoned that vision in favor of what you're talking about like a green wonderland or are they sort of being told don't worry you're not the industrializing there's a plan here. Oh I would say like it's both but definitely I mean we have to talk maybe a little bit more about the green party I think green party are two currents one is openly pro degrowth I think if you read Ulrike Hammond's book about degrowth she actually takes like example of the British war economy during the second world war where everything was a bit rationalized and like and she's saying like basically the economy was actually great everybody had what he needed to and and she takes this as an example where we should get to so like okay we all have to degrowth it's only possible with like de industrialization and degrowth and and so basically we all have to go back to the living standards of the 70s which were not that bad she says so it's actually hilarious absurd book but it's a best seller and a lot of people like love it and a lot of people think I would say like why maybe I don't know because they lack of a simple understanding of basic economy economics I don't know but it's popular it's really popular so this is one thing but like what was people told I mean this is this is more which I like maybe I don't know 10 15% maybe sympathize with this view just like consume less and make everything green and and and eat organic food and and form it yourself forever but like what the economy minister like what that have I was telling the people so like now we we gonna have a green which are so like we we gonna like transform the whole industry we're gonna produce green steel every house gets a heat pump and the auto mode of companies or car companies gonna produce electric vehicles so everybody will and basically was promising it is gonna be a huge boost for a German company is it's gonna be a English of the one and I think I like elected term energy blindness a lot where I think many people are kind of energy blind they don't they don't have an idea of how important energy is to produce things anything energy is just there and you just have to harvest it and take the sun and instead of Putin's gas and we don't have any problems this is maybe the biggest misunderstanding that now now the bill is coming with the thing okay like if you want to have that then everything just gonna get much more expensive the lose a lot of competitiveness and the end lose a lot of jobs and I think you could see it very well with the German car companies where I mean of course it was also like a decided in Brussels at the end that in 2030 or 35 there should be no Compustions engine cars produced in Germany but of course like there were also many car companies especially Volkswagen where you said like okay let's do this like we we're great we're just gonna produce electric we're just gonna be amazing and no one I mean was easy to see you could just read China 20 25 where they laid out a plan of how they they want to dominate the whole supply chain of electric vehicles from the raw materials to the batteries to the rare earths and everything you know so like you could see like hey if you're gonna do this then at least we need to have a plan right and China is already there what we want to be like they they control already the complete supply chain of battery metals for example I but so it was a bit like blind and yeah and then you have to say scary scary tendency in Germany which is I would say increasing that whenever somebody is asking questions or skeptic skeptic I guess easily framed as a right way now right so people like I would tell like I mean in private conversations a lot of people sell a ground I'm not sure if it's gonna work out but like publicly we were saying of course it's gonna work yeah turned out in a kind of tragic way now I think I think like now these months you were getting the bill you know see like companies closing down and and so just to push not a little more to understand it so I think I understand that there's a kind of hardcore green group I think we have them in most Western societies it sounds like they have a disproportionate influence over the German mindset because of some of the aspects you've talked about as an idealism covering up a wound etc but what about the people who do understand I mean it could be because ultimately we can discuss electric vehicles and the green Jetsons you'd hope you're whatever obviously we don't find it as realistic as some people do electric vehicles have proved themselves find there here to stay I think we'll see how long you know there might be issues with depreciation but they're so cheap now that the depreciation factor probably doesn't matter at least a Chinese process so they're here but that doesn't mean that you know we stop burning fossil fuels there I think that's fantastic that's a classic case of taking a piece of technology that's a shining object at the time and projecting it like when they thought we'd have flying cars in 1960s or something like that so okay I get that group and that's like a portion of the population whatever you want to say 20% 15% and they have disproportionate moral sway in Germany but as you say there are people who are like this might not work and ultimately the issue here as we always highlight the podcast and as I'm sure you know isn't really about the green transition itself it's about the fact that even if you are producing the EVs if you're electricity prices are too high your EVs aren't going to be competitive and that's why Germany is deindustrializing and that is worse for more energy intensive sectors like chemicals and so on which are huge in Germany and I have been huge in Germany for 150 years many of the chemical processes we use in the world today were invented in Germany in the early 20th century so what about so I guess what I'm asking is let's not put a percentage on it you kind of if you want but what sort of a cohort in German society understands that fundamental problem that it's not really about green versus non green it's about will your industry be competitive and are those people cowed are they like it is that impolite to say to say because the Russian gas being cut off we can't afford our industry is going to collapse and is that become kind of like verboten as well whenever you say something about about Russia it I think it has become verboten yes I think you cannot say publicly we we're like fucking up our industry because we're not taking Russian gas anymore I think you get like outcast very easily I think there are a lot of people who of course there'll be a lot of like great businessmen and really smart people who understand what's going on but how to say that I think I think some of them like definitely shared the dream of of the green transition I think it's for example if you take like a copy like Siemens I think they I mean it's not even a pipe dream for them I mean the ability at the electric infrastructure right they building the electricity networks and everything I mean for them it's great business right car companies it's it's it's a difficult thing whenever you get a little bit closer you you see like cracks in the in the dogma for example BMW was always producing combustion engines like on the side you know they were saying here we go big electric but like they still have the plans were still like producing combustion engines and they also were still like innovating and and and doing research on that and but they were criticized for that and now now it's like the first time a group is like actually the BMW's strategy was a bit smarter than the one of Volkswagen right so they they they they kept their options and I think to to understand a little bit we have to talk briefly about the German elections system as well that the political system because it's like a parliamentary systems that means that you always have to build coalitions and that means that the green party like I would say like this proportionally big influence and German politics then they might would have otherwise right they're like kind of like they're very good at like shaping the mainstream opinion or shaping the narrative and yeah and then I think a lot of people will more like I don't know center right or center left business and they just jumped on the train and this thing is going to be very interesting what what's going to happen the next month because like now you see the election results in some of the eastern Bundesl\u00e4nder where the after is also the strongest party now and and now it's like it's it's like obvious for almost everyone to this green project it's not going to work like like they thought it got to work I mean of course some of these people like Havik I think is kind of like scary Elastah last speech of her of him he was basically doubling down he just said like no we we we we should not change course now it's it's going to be very very dangerous if we give out the wrong signal to the population like we have to we have to stay course now it's it's now even more important to stay course right so this is this is if for me it's kind of like ideological tendencies this person is a is sharing yeah and then and then it's it's also interesting now that like by the old folks partying the big parties that city would they they they they they don't have a profile anymore it's like this SPD no one means all socialist or like workers party like they completely lost the profile there's no one no one who's like a factory worker why should he work for SPD why should he vote for SPD it's like this party is it's nothing like what he used to be and the percentage and elections are we animal 15% of the lucky I mean get river got like more than 40% right so it's really a shadow of it of it of what he used to be and then like everybody who has doubts or or let's put it like this I mean like that there are four big topics that are important not only in German society most of the west and it was like the refugee crisis or immigration problem the second one is is climate the third one was the coronapolises and the fourth one is the war in Ukraine right and if you disagree with the mainstream narrative on one of them you basically out you basically end up with the AfD or or or BSV right say this and this I think it's a big failure also of the old parties that they like I don't know they made the corridor for opinions so small that that left and right people were basically dropping out or kicked out you know that maybe if you ask many of them if you ask someone if it was not or didn't disagree with the coronapolises or doesn't disagree now with with when it comes to Ukraine I they mostly they don't want to leave the mainstream right but but they say like hey I'm kicked out like they say like hey I have like extreme position now and so the people who are coming back to a question I think people who are making the decisions or in the business world it's it has become a very small corridor of people and I would say in this corridor the green party the green narrative is quite powerful still it's maybe the most powerful narrative so on the matter of I suppose bringing together the last few questions and the last few answers into kind of one question about the German strategy I mean there are some of us who feel that German guilt about the past and also German political conformity that very narrow over-tune window that you described having been formed has actually made the world a worse place I think that if in sometime at any time really between 2014 and the end of 2021 there had been a Germany which was willing to be assertive on the foreign stage it had more than enough power to force through some kind of implicate implementation of the Minsk agreements that would have placated Russia and they were doing a great enough volume of business which is hugely profitable for Russia with Russia to kind of cajole the Russians into that and if the Germans had been assertive enough if Germany had been assertive enough to defend its natural interests if it had said no we like we can't have a war in our backyard that involves the the main supplier of energy to Germany and the guarantor of German security namely the United States we can't have that kind of war in our backyard we're not going to permit this it's in our interest to kind of to kind of clamp down on this we showed that it in 2003 so it is possible right should I did it well can you explain that process like what what what did should I do and how did it work out and why didn't it happen this time like why did why did why did Germany allow the Americans to drive the car on Eastern Europe well I think should have had a had a lucky window in history because Russia was not seen as such a threat back then by the US and Iraq was far away let's open up the big thing like I'm fascinated by a Przyski doctrine right which was always which is saying basically that it's it's an American interest to avoid a kind of alliance or a soft alliance between German industry the Russian raw materials and the Chinese population at Chinese market and I think in 2003 this was not a threat for the US like because Russia was not seen as a it was seen as a as a as a loser of the Cold War and not as a strong opponent China was also I don't know back then maybe 10th largest economy in the world definitely not the second largest and and also I think it was a bit of mentality right and it was still like the world is growing together and Europe is growing together and some are like peace was in the air right so I think he had a kind of like lucky window of history to to allow Germany to say now and I think this window wasn't there anymore in 2022 when when Russia invaded Ukraine I mean theoretically of course I wish Germany would have taken another course and wish Germany maybe would have I know get a new profit profiles as a peacemaker or whatever right so if I say this publicly in Germany like a lot of people would jump up my thoughts like are you are you are you are you BSV or something right so I'm I'm basically even the mainstream but like saying something like this which is absurd but yeah I would I would say I mean not try to avoid to get into conspiracy theories but yeah like my feeling is I think many people have the feeling that US influence has has grown is somehow dictating the German foreign policy as well I mean I don't know like you probably read it in the US that like last week a German free gate was crossing the Taiwan street Beijing was upset of course I mean from a law perspective there were right of course this international waters okay why not go through it but then again like what what the hell does a German warship has to do in a Pacific right and why do you why do you want to provoke China I mean it's one of your largest trading partners but what's in there for Germany to do that to provoke China it's nothing in it for Germany and still they do it and yeah I mean you can make many theories why why the German policy is so now so close to the US camp so I mean moving I mean you know on this subject to kind of get down to the very basics the the very basics of what is German grand strategy what I see as having been German grand strategy traditionally is that since unification in the second half of the 19th century Germany has you know always required markets for its goods it you know it's always been a tremendous producer of of goods especially after the second industrial revolution so it's always needed open markets for these goods and it's also also needed a tremendous amount of raw materials to kind of to fuel this production and traditionally and and so I guess in the modern sense that you know it's in the German interest to maintain the European Union single market which does provide that seamless marketplace for manufactured goods it also makes sense eminent sense for Germany to keep open those fast growing areas of the world in Southeast Asia like China and Vietnam and and and Singapore and all of those potential marketplaces but it also especially makes sense for Germany to build close ties and and try very hard to build very close ties with Russia first of all because as I said earlier you know the Russian Federation is the single largest consumer marketplace in in Europe and also of course it's a it's a global natural resources superpower it has literally everything that Germany could possibly want and it can you know metals food gas oil you know even things like gold and various industrial metals like nickel I mean it's a kind of a it's a it's a bounteous place as far as Germany's concerned and then of course as I say you also have that market so is there any sense that you know it seems clear and I think the polling and the election results show that the German people think it's clear as well that the mainstream parties have gone down the wrong route is there any sense that the BSW the Sarah Vagenknecht and and the AFD will you know we'll be able to influence German politics to the extent where Germany might look to refocus on its traditional foreign policy aims especially given it seems that in the next decade or so the US will start shifting attention towards China by necessity and thus away from Europe it's a good point I mean first I think you have to acknowledge that neither the AFD nor the business of Vagenknecht have a good economic plan or economic policy I mean Zahavagenknecht she's a fascinating person she's she's intellectually really bright she's like she has one of the highest reputations of all politicians in the German population so she's really impressive but at the end she's a socialist right so she doesn't have like a really smart or contemporary I would say contemporary economic policy plan and the NEA that has the AFD the AFD is at the end exonophobic party and not really not really open for trade I think this is this is like a open flank of these parties because they they no none of the really big companies would like like endorse them in any way right so really at the moment they're reading party after not really the lower class a lot of middle class people as well and probably also in the upper class a lot of like unhappy and frustrated people who give the vote to these parties but like I think they don't have the they don't have the power or the knowledge yet to really make to really get get big companies on their side so this is I think it would be a long way for them but having said this I think of course they're going to shake the German policy a lot because like now if you get a little bit closer to the the German Bundesland if you select two lignan for example the AFD is the strongest party so they have to write to build a coalition the second strongest party is the CDU but they said we're not going to form a coalition with the AFD and the BSV does not want to do a coalition with the AFD neither so basically it's it's like a path situation so they're not they're not able to form a government and it's probably going to be like this for quite a long time and Brandtenburg I think this weekend elections in Brandtenburg and it's going to be similar it's going to be very very hard to form any kind of government and at the end it takes I mean but if you go now on the on the Bundespolitik elections are next year none of the just I expect the old parties the the Alp Patain has has the guts to I would say change the course on the four big topics I mentioned before which is climate is immigration is corona and is Ukraine more so they're basically all in line and I don't I don't see a solution for that at the moment I think my my feeling is more that the politics so maybe you can call it a day late gonna try like to rule with a minority government against the majority of the people and I think that's I think this is this is this is on the horizon now and I think they're gonna they're gonna try this as long as it as it's possible and I think it's just gonna increase the division in the order that this content and the discomfort of the people of the government this is this what you see now and I think there are a lot of like situations everybody I think I did know in Germany where you you sit down with friends and then have a few beers or wine and then suddenly people are saying things they would never say publicly let's say like immigration is a little bit different thing like I think this is this is the first big topic where you see like a policy change is now okay like we becoming kind of like a consents that Merkel immigration policies absolutely outdated that's something needs to be done but you don't see them with the other three topics and I don't know at the moment I don't see any tendency in one of the parties to to give any ground to to these things and and I think it's it's it's gonna go on they have this what they call bandmauer which means like firewall where they say like no one of the so-called democratic parties is gonna form a coalition with the AfD and that means there will be a lot of like a path situations and in many Bundesland but with the government and a lot of people are like what's this I mean especially in the east where people are kind of like more sensitive or I don't know maybe you can call it naive in a way but like they said like hey we went to the streets 30 years ago to to bring down an anti-democratic system and and we thought we have democracy now what you're doing is this is not democratic right you're just like we we voted for the majority voted for party and you're you're not gonna let them build a government and anything those frustrations just it's it's it's gonna increase I mean just to push back on that as far as I understand the CDU which is Angela Merkel's old party the Christian Democrats the kind of center the the traditional European center right party you know it's still doing okay in the polls the feeling that I get from my admittedly ignorant view of German politics is that the CDU next year is most likely to be the largest party single party for the federal elections and it you know it's likely to be able to form a government and in addition to that you know I have seen shalts and you know really starts since the elections in brand I think Brandenburg and Saxony were the two that were or a Turingia that since then you know he has started talking a little bit more tough on immigration that you know there have been some deportations back to Afghanistan there's talk about giving Afghanistan migrants money to you know migrate but you know to repatriate back to Afghanistan and I you know I I wonder whether that would be even easier for the CDU to do and whether there's any possibility perhaps that you know I mean after you will certainly be locked out of any coalitions next time but you know will it really be the majority the minority ruling against the mind the majority is it really going to be that bad? I don't know if it's just going to be the case in the Bundesliga if you'd elected the overall German polls a little bit more benign I would say to the big parties but like if you watch like the elections in the Bundesliga it's sometimes very bad and then one thing with like immigration policy I mean I would say it's more like a bit of a like a like I say like lip service because I mean the immigration policy is a mess but it's a mess on a European level and there is no way Germany can change the immigration laws just by itself I mean you can you can close the borders again but nobody wants that because it's also like a lot of economic damage for the people who are commuting from other countries to work in Germany and I mean to hold the whole EU immigration immigration system the Dublin 2 treaty and everything I mean this this is going to be like a it's a piece of work so I don't I don't see big changes coming there and then with the CDU of course I mean I mean at the end the differences are minor there will be there will be some pushbacks I think on the green agenda I think probably the combustion engine for both will fall 2035 that will be probably able to produce combustion vehicles longer but when it comes to Ukraine I mean the CDU is so merts is even it's even more hard like right they are the ones who are basically the opting or we say let's let's deliver more weapons let's let's have no negotiations with Russia and so I don't I don't see a big change on the horizon now it's hard to say for me and also if you if you check the polls like also on the country level like the votes are so small that they will they will have to form like a very big coalition again which like waters down everything no so it probably will be the city who SPD like a grand coalition which Merkel had and probably they need a third party as well which will be the Greens for example so you you basically will get the same again and and and not a big change and I think this just drives more and more people to to the extreme extreme parties if you want to call them like this yeah I think that's correct you even if they're even if the CDU could pick up votes by kind of faking it it'll just make people even more angry because then they'll have to lie because they won't be able to carry through okay from a broader perspective at the beginning of the war when some of the crazy stuff started to happen the economic stuff sanctions all this kind of thing within a bit of weaker too I was kind immediately thinking that we were reliving the economic consequences of the peace by Jermen Erkaine so I don't know if people are familiar with that book it's the one that actually made Keynes famous it's not a work of economic theory it was a commentary on the Treaty of Versailles and the subsequent what he thought would be the subsequent so you can outcomes of the Treaty of Versailles and he got a pretty much right it collapsed Germany and that ended in chaos I think I alluded to this earlier the Germans are very inclined to think a lot about what happened in World War 2 and less inclined to think about what led to it which was probably the Treaty of Versailles anyway not to get all onto historical tangent the problem with the Treaty of Versailles caused was effectively Vimarer or Germany it destroyed the country collapsed into hyperinflation and I think my fear from the beginning of the Ukraine war and the return to this basically zero-sum economic thinking thinking of geopolitics or economics and geopolitical terms you punch me I punch you and eventually someone gets knocked out and then you win and you get a medal that's not how the economy works if you start punching each other everyone goes poor that's basically the last sum of the Treaty of the economic consequences of the peace so I guess I'm not the only one I don't think that's concerned that if Germany keeps going down this path it's going to end in a very miserable place it probably won't be the hyperinflation of the 1920s but people have higher expectations now than they did in the 1920s people were very poor in the 1920s relative to living standards today and a fairly decent hit to living standards and high unemployment in Germany and poor jobs bad jobs that don't earn that much money and don't support the local and regional economy could really really anger people I think that to me is is one of the biggest concerns because that could prove very politically destabilizing so I guess I'd ask two things one of them's an easy question and the other one's a very difficult question but see what you can do with it the first one is at least when I was studying in university 15 years ago or however long ago it was I'm not saying that everybody read the economic consequences of peace I don't think they did but I think the lesson was learned and I think the way that it was basically told to people was the martial plan was God and that kind of gave people a sense that fixing even your old enemy is a good idea because then everyone's prosperous and friends and no chaos occurs and to my mind 15 years ago that was just conventional wisdom in history classes in everything like liberals taught it conservative thought it like it was completely uncontroversial so the first I've been shocked one of the things I've been shocked about in the past two years is the people of unlearn that lesson in such a short period of time and that was a to my mind that was a very deep cultural learning experience it's been very frustrating so the first thing I'd say is how has that played out in Germany because I'm sure you guys have the same history about the martial plan and the work together stuff and then the second question much more difficult but see what you can do with it how how bad do you think it could get if people's living standards get cut to shreds in Europe and especially in Germany and there is this political instability I don't expect that we'll get the rise of the national socialists again but do you have any sense of like where that could go like it just feels to me that people voting for the if day or or Saravegan Knox party is just that's only a beginning like people aren't poor yet the industry hasn't disappeared yet give this 10 years like where can we go there you go and a relatively normal question and a crystal ball question that everybody loves to hate well I started I started the second one and I don't know if you if one of you had like taken a train recently in Germany because like I mean German trains it did they used to be famous for being on time right on your good service and and now this has become such a mess like I'm yeah by the way I took a train from you know to go to Cologne 10 15 years ago and I was as a British person awed by the quality of the service just everything like what it was like in Cologne railway station the trains themselves how inexpensive they were how fast they were how clean they were like everything single single thing for me was just fantastical and and it made me a little bit jealous yeah it's become such a mess now it's it's really incredible like you you always have a delay I mean as I was statistically I think 60% of the trains now are delayed and some of them have like delay last time I was traveling from D\u00fcsseldorf to Munich and it had like a four-hour delay and even if you don't have a delay then I don't know the aircon isn't working or I don't know this stuff is is not there that board is through the board restaurant is closed for whatever reason and and it it really has become like tremendously dysfunctional and and you have to you have to impression that it's actually like like exponentially there's a wrong word but the new one is going down like fast and fast it gets worse and worse and worse and and actually this is the case because like the system was like running okay with like some minor problems for a while but there was like no investment into the tracks and now like this is like basically compounding and it's it's it's getting down in a in a tremendous speed and like everybody's feeling it of course because everybody's taking a train once in a while you see like well it's it's just really dysfunction Switzerland for example did stop um letting German trains crossing the border now because like they're messing up their time table in Switzerland because they're always late and creating chaos so they're like no no German trains anymore like people now if you go to Switzerland you have to exit the train on the border wait for a bus and then cross the border and then go into a Swiss train it's it's it's it's really bad and statistics say I think you need like 30 to 40 billion I don't they'll meet down in the number but like a like a high amount of like billions investment and if you do this now then the train system would be working or functional again around 2027 probably it's like there are no 30 billion I mean Germany like uh sent 30 billion to Ukraine it's a bit of a elephant in the room like no one is everybody's like kind of feeling it's like well wait wait we spend a lot of money to Ukraine right so but I know what you know our train system is messed up maybe we could have invested that but but it's not like it's not like you don't read about you know you don't get this calculation in the media you don't read like just people like feel it or think about it in their everyday life so this is this is like one very obvious thing where where German people see now that something is really not okay in this country and and then of course another like taking time bound nothing to use the pension system I mean Germans are getting too old the pension system is basically underfunded um this is one reason why we have immigration but like also like you said a new podcast I turns out that like people will end up not um uh contribute doing so much money to the pension system but a more like coasting one here the government so coming back to your question like I don't see like a big catastrophe like happening in the next two or three years because it's still like kind of a rich country especially like like south of Germany it's like there's a lot of like old wealth and and also the cities are kind of rich so I think there's a big caution there that the people will use in the next years um I would also say that like people have to get used to inflation in the upper single digits I know something between five and 15 percent and um but I don't know what at the end like I mean some people would call it the propaganda system is working very well I'm not sure about this I mean I've worked in mainstream media and I can assure it is not like really propaganda department that is telling people what to think and what to read but uh but I know I like most people are pretty complacent still I mean in the east it's different some are for historical reasons because I have a history of like rebelling against the state right and distrusting the state because of the common history they were living in but in Germany like people are still like very starts gloivic so they they they are quite sure that the government is doing the right thing and like let's let them do the thing we think it's it's gonna be okay and I think until disbelief um has worn off that they'll take a couple of years there's still some fuel in the tank to like keep everything kind of okay but I'm pretty sure that like the living standards in the next years will like decline big time and the first question about like do people still think that like economy is a is a win-win game and not a zero-sum game or do you think a martial plan is a good thing I suppose I mean the educated class you know if you if you went to university that's the broad picture you were given we made a mistake after World War One by thinking of things in a zero-sum game and punishing the loose you know what what do you think of if they think of like if if there's peace if if if if Russia is defeated and um so we can rebuild Ukraine and this gonna be like a big a big profit and and a huge a huge win for German industry that that's what some people say but um no one is I never heard anyone in the educated class like just having a like a uh a mind game of like what what actually would happen if Russia wins or how would it look like if if Russia somehow makes a win in this war and I I don't think that people are thinking about this I mean probably in the big companies they have their own departments who like do their strategic games but like you don't read anything about this in the press like it's just like okay once the war is over we're gonna rebuild Ukraine and everybody like we all gonna get a little bit richer I mean is there any hope I mean this you know we on the podcast often kind of joke about our um how you know filled with doom we are about Europe especially but you know without cheap pipeline Russian gas without the Chinese market which seems to be getting ever farther away there seems to be ever more friction between Europe and Germany uh Europe and China and that obviously involves Germany with high levels of migration um whether that's an economic positive or not it creates a certain degree of social strain always and everywhere with the fact that there is going to come soon the bill to to uh stabilize and rebuild Ukraine no matter what anybody says about that being all done by the private sector it won't be and no matter whatever anybody says about Ukraine being the kept being able to get back on its own feet it won't be able to and it will need to be stabilized you know unless you want a kind of a a super poor or even failed state on the on the border uh that's gonna come soon um you need huge amount of investment in infrastructure not just the rail as far the the railway system as far I understand but in other areas of infrastructure as well but you know industry is is grinding slowly into dust it's not a sudden deindustrialization but it's clearly happening I mean where's the hope like you know is there any hope for Germany's future I mean do you think it's possible to arrest some of these trends before they become irreversible maybe two things like I maybe you want to end up with a like kind of positive anecdote but uh but but to make sure I think I think it has to get worse until it can get better and I think we just we just seeing like right now people are realizing that hey uh what was promised to us two or three years ago it's not gonna work out um so I think this will this will take some time until the politics or the companies will change course um but like to to end with uh I don't know I don't want to end now but like with a positive anecdote a reason he was listening a a German company a midsize company and it's you know it's like the backbone of the German economy like small uh quite often family owned companies that nobody knows and it's a company owned a sixth generation somewhere in Bavaria and they're building um um they're building for electricity systems they build like little switches to um to stabilize the the power sorry like it's it's a really like very detailed thing you know but it's like basically in in every electricity system you need these little switches right and they're the market leader and they're supplying 50% of the bill with these little things like out of a small town in Bavaria and um and of course they at the moment they have no problems at all because everybody is like uh the whole world is trying to electrify everything and and they said like we were like doubling or a revenue in the next year and I think this is something quite under looked and also it's getting damaged right now but still like there's there's something um I would say beneath the surface that many people who don't know German economy maybe maybe don't don't don't see there's like a really uh uh thousands of midsize companies were like very smart engineers who basically don't care much about politics they just they just like try to do business and they think this is kind of that can be the anchor that maybe saves their German economy um you",

      "text": "The amazing thing about when I wrote that piece was two days later, I think, Vincatesh Rau, legend of legends, wrote a really sharp response to it that built on the idea and introduced the concept of the cozy web and took it further. Maggie Appleton, a week after that, made a really nice visual that showed like a top apography of the internet that really spread. And just, the idea just kept bubbling. And I, like every time one of those pieces came out, I read them was super excited about it, had like a folder where I just tracked all the things. And started to think about this idea of what if we were kind of a collective canon? Because this over time felt like a core piece of internet, native knowledge. But it was one that was really explored through a lot of different people. Like I had a first piece, but like the other pieces in the series took the idea even farther and like played it out in other spaces. And I was starting to work on a new project, Metal Label, which is a built to help creative people make projects together, do things together, make collaboration really simple. And this, this project seemed like a very obvious case for that where I couldn't imagine how I could publish a book with 12 of us together with any ease using some trad publishing structure. But Metal Label has this whole splits function and we can automatically distribute money and all that. And so suddenly a lot of the logistics became trivial. And we could just try to express something as all of us together. So I ended up reaching out to each, each person this book individually and shared this idea of, hey, we make this thing and we split 70% of the profits equally. We put 30% into a shared treasury that we will use to make more projects in the future because hopefully this is just the first thing we do. And let's just see what happens. And everyone had already written their pieces. So it's just no one really had to lift a finger. And it came together really, really beautifully. And to me, when I read all of these things at once, the weight of them really did add up. And you could, you know, these pieces cover about five years of writing on the internet. And you can feel the culmination. You can feel them move through different areas. And to me, it really is an encapsulation of a moment in time and a really important transition of the web. You used to be a music critic. We both come from this background of culture. I'm going to try and condense a few things here. But this is why I think this topic is so interesting. Is that as good progressives, we were kind of taught or I guess led to absorb this idea that having complete horizontality that letting everybody in is like the good, kind of moral progressive gesture, abolish the gatekeepers, give everyone a platform, Arab Spring, occupy Wall Street, this kind of mass, leaderless, disorganized protest, a kind of cacophony of voices. And I look at that now and I think this was not really a kind of progressive solution. This was a deeply libertarian solution in that you created this chaotic, dynamic marketplace of attention. And you have to kind of slowly, this is what makes this conversation so difficult, walk back this old idea you inherited and talk about the value of curation and editorial standards and gatekeeping. And that is not a conversation that progressives are used to having. But coming from this background of culture, we value editors and curators. Like the purpose of these spaces was to keep the gates in some sense. Yeah, I think those are interesting tensions and they are, I would not say they are resolved for me. I do think I am more of a classic liberal and that I generally just trust people to know and pursue what is best for them. And I don't see myself as the bright arbiter of that. And with Kickstarter, we took an extremely active hand in moderation. Part of it was that it was a space where you could raise money and we're just like, what is this going to do? Let's try to just be measured about this. For people who don't know, there was an approval process. For everything that went on. There was an approval process for the first five years. I mean, it still exists for several categories. But for the first five years, every single thing that went on Kickstarter was personally approved by a member of our staff. We reviewed maybe 500,000 project ideas. Imagine if every tweet that went out, someone at Twitter had to read this and say, okay, you can publish that entirely different world. So what that led to was a huge amount of trust, which we thought we deserved. I mean, we put a lot of work. We really cared. Like all of us who worked at Kickstarter really loved the things happening on the sites. We genuinely cared. But we came to realize is that projects started raising a lot of money without doing much to demonstrate trust. And we realized, oh, they're burning our reputation. It's our wrap of saying we care. And therefore, something is in. That means we're saying it's okay. And so they're just like, oh, that dynamic is not what you want. How do you deal with that? There are other spaces on the web. The Vimeo YouTube is an interesting example. Vimeo had a lot of rules. Vimeo, you couldn't put up videos of your self-playing video games, which is how Twitch began. That was the biggest use of Vimeo when they cut it out because they're like our editorial standards say it's diminishing the brand value. Right. And YouTube takes an open stance and became far more effective and powerful as a result. So I think at platform levels, I have come around more to default to more open things. I have also run moderation teams for over a decade. And blanket moderation rules are very, very hard. Right. You really, you come to realize that if you look at eBay's terms, so service, it has a crazy long list of all these specific things. Because what you find is that you create general rules and then users will fight you using legalese to say, how come this and this and this and like this whole triangulation where you're like, all right, fine. We have to have a rule that says no sleeping bags that do this, this and this because otherwise this person is just going to keep giving us grief. It's just it's such a moving target that's very hard. But I do believe that a lot of moderation policies are like very trendy in of a moment and may or may not hold up to longer scrutiny. Well, we've certainly seen a big turn a lot of that. We've seen a lot of that. Going in all kinds of wrong ways. Yeah, I mean, there's all sorts of risks for it. But as I think about metal label, which we have started with being a very, very curated contain space. Ultimately, I believe, you know, Craigslist, neutral spaces that provide a defined value that people understand how to behave are what are most useful, I think, in the end. But as you get into smaller and more specific things, if it's like why you want your work to be in a specific gallery and not in Amazon, like there's all sorts of dynamic, mix that come into play depending on what the goals are. But yeah, I've spent a lot of years deep in the moderation trenches and it's a double edge sword that's really, really tough to get right. And I think anyone that's been time in it is very humbled about the challenge of it. And in the end, you're just like you want to default towards as much openness as possible without destroying what makes a space what it is. Yeah, I mean, the classic example I always bring up for this is 8chan, which when 4chan decided to ban gamer gate as a topic, all of the people who wanted to talk about that went to this other website that got even more extreme and more literally more dangerous and violent in the real world. And so in some cases, when you tried to stop the flow of certain information or topics or what have you, you actually create a worse outcome by concentrating all of those people into the same space and then they get more radical as a result. So yeah, moderation, extremely, extremely difficult. I am generally of the opinion that sunlight is the best disinfectant, allow everything to be shown, allow people to discuss amongst themselves. And if there's a bad idea given enough criticism, it will often fall flat. But that is not always the case for culture. So I think when you're putting together a magazine, what I value from reading a quality publication is that the shitty opinions are excluded. I don't want to have to sift through the entire internet to find one good piece. So those editors, those that kind of gatekeeping mechanism, again, becomes very important. We both come from this background of creative life. One of the things that I noticed early on was that the economic models, the method of distribution was shaping the things that I could make that then led to making things which would excel in the system and the method of distribution sales essentially act back onto the creative work where everything has to be in the case of art, a 30 by 40 painting that fits over a couch. Everything that you publish to the internet has to be a kind of snappy, spicy meme that kicks up in the news feed and so on. You have to have a sexy selfie attached to everything. You are a music critic before this. How do you find your way from the world of music and creative life to a project like Kickstarter? I'm just still stuck at your sexy selfies. It's absolutely humiliating. I fucking hate that part. I've tried to follow all those same models you're supposed to and they just keep not working for me. So again, it's them, not me. I have to make new things for myself. When I worked as a music critic, my full-time gig for about 10 years, I was one of the first pitchfork writers for the Village Voice. I also started a tiny record label where I was just taking the CDRs at basement shows that Bans had and I'd be like, let me put online for you. I can sell it online for you. You'll get all the money. So I put up the first records a lot of great artists that way. But I just experienced over and over in every creative field and it was the same I wrote a lot about film, then Tuno's also a film critic. Was that all the projects and work that I loved struggled to get made? You learn about David Lynch taking out some Bulgarian oil tycoon for dinner and casting their daughter and to get the $200,000 to finish the movie. That is the fund raise. That is the sorts of things that you have to do. But yet, I was a super fan. I would do anything for New Lynch and so would so many other people. But yet, we just had no place to play. There's more great work than the powers that be appreciated or understand, but there are fans that do. Just felt like a truth, just a deep truth. One of the deepest truths I could recognize. And at the time we were working on it was when the show, a rest of the development of Fox sitcom, that was popular. It was getting canceled after its first season. It was the lowest rate. One of the lowest rate shows on television, but had a deep fan base. It's a great show. Great show. The fans were sending Fox like bananas because of something within the show to protest this decision. Because of the banana stand. And we were working on the idea of Kickstarter then. And Perry Chan, founder of Kickstarter for CEO, he knew David Cross who was an actor on the show on a rest of development. He knew David's cousin. And so we got a meeting with David to say, hey, we have an idea of how to save a rest of development. Instead of fans sending these bananas, we can make a page and we could just prepay the whole season. People can pre-purchase the DVD box set before it's made. That was the pitch. Yeah, he explained that we didn't understand how the entertainment industry worked, which was correct. And he did become our first investor out of that, though. It was just like, yeah, this makes sense. But there's this notion that there's boardrooms with extremely limited world views of what's possible. And then there are the people. And the people actually know what they want. And the taste of the people and the taste of those people in those boardrooms are quite different. Right. And I mean, I'll be honest, when Perry first came to me to share the idea of what came to be called crowdfunding, I was the ivory tower rock critic, where my first response was, oh, I don't like this. This is just American idol for everything. Right. Right. Like, do we really want that? Well, you have a vested interest to protect your precarious position, which you're probably not getting paid an enormous amount of money, but they're very scarce positions. There's only so much print space in these different magazines. And so, yeah, you're like, oh, this thing threatens me. You'll take my $50 pay rate for my whole dead hands. But people will defend that $50 very intensely. I mean, it's literally all we had. And what we came to realize and what Perry helped me see was, it's not one audience. It's all these niches. It's the person in Wyoming who makes really exceptional work that has no context there, but online. And with other people, they can find that. And it's about that connection. Yeah. It's really about that connection. And so, it was really just a big vote of confidence and trust in people. And that people could make informed decisions that people can be in charge of, can be the gatekeepers, that people can give the green light. And that, yeah, that actually makes a lot more sense. It really came to feel like there had been a wall where everyone was lining up to try to get through this one door of institutional funding. It was a long ass line. And like most of us were like, I have no shot in that line. I'm not even going to try. Right. But then there's just wall. And we just simply built a door where this wall had been. And it was just instantly obvious to everybody of like, oh, yeah, just do it this way. I mean, I always believed in the project. But really the degree to which people just sort of got it and went with it and accepted it was really striking to me because I kept waiting for like someone to come by with a clipboard to like, it's okay. Well, you all are doing like, hey, we're, yeah, yeah. We were representing the man. We're here today just to make sure you're compliant or whatever. And it's like, oh, shit. There's just like new things happening that weren't before. And I guess there's just how the world works. And that, yeah, I continue to think it's a great, I mean, it's a great energy. It's a great story. And the structure of crowdfunding is something that will persist forever now. I think it's just about mass power, mass power plus money. Yeah, that works. Yeah. Our good friend, our mutual friend Matt Dryhurst likes to say that talent is evenly distributed but opportunity is not. And so this kind of crowdfunding mechanism can really give a platform and financial support to people who may not live in a major metropolitan city or maybe not have like the institutional nepotistic connections or. Yeah. And I have none of them. I mean, I grew up nowhere. I have no connections. Like I moved to New York, absolutely nobody. You know, I, I've never belonged in any of those places ever, ever. I've always been a hustling from the edge and wall flowering and doing my weird thing. It really, but you know what, there's a lot more of us. Then there are the folks who navigate through all the institutional channels. You know, now it's like you can have a job being creative. But it's interesting to see like there's three words that we all closely associate, you can see their difference in an artist. An artist is someone who is creating, manifesting image, manifesting something out of their own volition at a sun drive, although artists are always subservient to somebody generally, but we'll say it's for self expression. There's the term of a creative, which is an advertising term. An advertising is where creativity research first went into really became real. And a creative is a commercial artist, someone who performs the act of the artist, but on behalf of the corporation. That is what a creative is. Now we have the term of a creator. And a creator is a self employed commercial artist. They are making commercial art on behalf of platforms. It is a direct exchange. They are unintermediated, but they are commercial artists compared to a capital A artist. Each of these has different past. Artists is formal education and all sorts of institutional networking, a whole game you have to play. Commercial artists, can you deliver on time to your client and are you a good employee? And then to be a creator is ultimately your audience is kind of your employer. And how well do you perform with what you wish them to see? But these are very interrelated but distinct forces. You can see how creativity creators are really kind of a gentrification of the artist, of which once again the artist is not benefit. The creators aren't really included in the creator economy. Creator economy is a self employed. This is self employed. That is the class that benefits from now. But it is just such a huge force in our lives today. And unimaginable to think someone sat down to say like what could we do? Creativity, let's try that. It really was a decision that was made. And I, when I first learned this through a book by an author named Samuel W. Franklin, the Cult of Creativity, came out last year that details this history. And I felt really upset when I first read this. So I was like am I, am I like at the... You get siong in the siong? You get siong by the DoD. And you know what? Sure I did. Sure I did. And what part? Like what do I actually know? Versus what have I been taught to know. Hi everybody. This is Joshua Siderella. Would you just heard as an excerpt from this week's bonus episode?

      "text": "Greetings, Greywolves. Amber Lee Frost here, coming to you from my secret writing layer, where I'm in edits on my forthcoming book, Dirtbag, now on preorder. But Amber, I hear you say, I can't read anything that's not on a screen anymore. Don't worry. Dirtbag is written by ADHD for ADHD. Rapid cycling through memoir, journalism, essay, and shit talk so fast, you'll feel like you're just scrolling through the timeline, having fun with your friends online. And Dirtbag is full of dirt. You'll get politics. So you guys ready for a radical idea? Dotsit, I hear she does car commercials in Japan. Violence. Sex. And the most dangerous game, podcasting. I'm going to fucking stupid show. Holy shit. So click the damn link and preorder dirtbag, not for me, but for spite. Because of enough people by my book, The New York Times has to print it. And they're going to hate that. Are you a fan of TikTok? You like TikToks? Yes, dude. Oh my god. The way the socialist kids on there, like when they do a dance and there's a label that says depression. And then there's one that says capitalism. And then there's one that says my teacher. And then there's one that says 35-year-old man from Twitter harassing me and talking to him. Dude, watch out, Jeff Kisses, a Amazon. It's the hottest news social media platform. And I think that we need to get in on some of its trends. And one of the big trends on TikTok now is questions for boys. It's like you're supposed to do it. You know, it's like a do-at as a feature on TikTok where you can sort of like answer people's questions directly to them. And I think we could do a version of these for us. And this is much credit, Mike Racine, who's doing some amazing work on TikTok these days. Please check out Mike Racine. Yeah, Mike Racine's the way he's taken the video. He's the only media entity that did a good job pivoting the video. So he's been the only one in history. Racine has been doing Yomans work, answering questions about boys from girls. But for today's episode, I thought we would kick things off with questions from a real-life girl. I brought one with me. Hi, it's me, a girl. Damn, WME came in good. They have girls. Shout out to our agents for getting a girl. All right, boys, you ready for this? This is Questions for Boys Part One. Like for Part Two. Do you like Blons or do you like Brunettes? Gotta be, I'm team Blond all the way. You gotta keep this wrap and fire. Team Blond. Well, I, of course, when we watch the movie, unforgettable or whatever the fuck it was called, the Johnster movie about how we should solve problems, I like a type of very cruel, blonde woman. But really, any type of hair is defined. Really, I think they're all beautiful. Yeah, bald, preferably, honestly. Hair is fascist. Does it piss you off when we can't figure out where to eat? Oh my God, nothing gets me more tilted. Nothing gets me more tilted. All right, hold down. Hold down. I mean, like, just, you're asking me what to eat for dinner. I give you an answer. And then it's like, no, not that. Save this for a relationship therapist. Well, this is just a story. OK, just, you're here to ask TikTok questions. OK? All right, babe. I'm going to flip it on its head here. When you're doing the thing with a girl where she's like, I don't know where do you want to eat, they like it when you take command. And by take, go, I don't know. I'm hungry. And then say that you have a stomach ache and sort of like crawl on the floor. Let out something that's more pathetic than a cry. You're too weak to cry. I, obviously, it's always irritating when you can't decide on what to have for dinner. But I can't get too angry because I will admit that I, in general, have a difficult time picking to that Libra energy. And just can't make a choice. So I sympathize with the ladies on that one. But yeah, of course, it's always irritating. I'm a Gemini. So sometimes I want sushi. Sometimes I want to Sam some galaxy. And sometimes you want both. Yeah. I like, I don't know. I, you know, every five years when I'm with a girl and we're figuring out what to eat, it can get irritating. But I, from growing up around women, like a lot of people don't know this. My mom's actually a woman. I have a process of elimination. Women were, women were very important to Felix's childhood growing up. Yeah, there's a huge deal. Like the two main things, the three things for me were stairs. That was big. That was a big part of my childhood with women because of my mom and my sister, of course. And Christmas, those are the three things. But so you just, you got to narrow it down. Like you can get annoying, but you can be like, OK, like, what's your name again? What are you of vegetarian? I forgot. We probably talked about it for two hours. I was looking at my phone. They updated the Dark Souls lore Wikipedia. Um, OK, do you, are you a vegan? Do you want to eat like a vegan sandwich where they, you know, make a piece of wheat that they say is hamburger or do you want to, do you want a bowl? Are you one of those bowl, are you, are you one of those bowl women? A lot of women are bowling. Women love food balls. I do love a football. Women love food balls. So, you know, well, it's because a bowl is sort of a puzzle. It's like you've got to find out where the peas are and the lettuce. And it's like, it's what you give to higher primates. I'm not saying women are apes. I'm not saying that at all. But I'm saying that they find it to be an enrichment exercise. And typically, like, if your girlfriend is, like, letting out high-pitched, like, screams and like, scratching the walls, inviting you, it's because she isn't getting enough enrichment. And you have to give her more bowls. And perhaps she doesn't know where to eat because she's not getting enough enrichment. Food for thought, folks. That's good. Yeah. Let's go the next question. Do you notice when we like other guys' tweets? No, I'm not, I'm not about that. That jealousy is for, that's for conners. I'm a wolf. So if you're true alpha, you don't concern yourselves with the likes of sheep. I don't, I really don't concern myself too much. I do have put spyware on every little computer. And I know when she's so much as hovers over the avi of another man. And I will tell both the man whose tweet she faved, avi, she enlarged, likes, you know, she looked at. And her that I will kill myself. I mean, it's like, you know, liking another guy's tweets, that's one thing. Licking another guy's podcast, you know, if you're a relationship, you're a podcaster. And let's say your girlfriend, like, your podcast is probably like they're, I don't know, generously third or fourth favorite podcast behind CUNN's Town and YKS. You know, like that can even someone in light and by Grimm and brutal truth can sometimes be, you know, a little bit, a little bit, get a little sensitive about that. You know, like, what a girlfriend is for is to push you to always be your best, always be pushing you to be better, always, always competing with other alpha males. So if I were you, I would be, I would be thanking any theoretical girlfriend for that. You're right. Iron sharpens iron. And you know, like the cum blaze and chop off. It's just like we got to, we're like the iron smashing against each other. And by that, I mean our dicks. And Catherine's hurt as usual. I mean, I can, I don't like, I don't have a girlfriend. I don't. Oh, you heard it here first folks. Felix is single. I don't, I don't want anyone. I walk alone. I stand alone. God's back. But I do have a family. And my, my podcast is the second favorite podcast in the family. You could, I don't know if anyone's astute enough to guess what their favorite podcast is. But let's put it this way. Everyone in my family who isn't me is a woman or a gay man. So, you know, what do you think it is? But that's okay because it's like, okay, that's like, I don't make one of those. They make one of those and like, you know, it's the way that's the way the ball rolls. Yeah, it's not a, I'm not a guy at the separation of podcasting labors. Are you ready for another question? It is. Oh, yeah. What's the one thing you really wish we knew about dudes rock that it's that they do. I wish they would accept it. Let's draw. I wish when, what I wish when we would know about dudes rock is that dudes rock and they're going to keep on rockin. Yeah, there's nothing. They honestly more than anything. It's accepted because it will not stop. Dudes aren't going to stop rockin any time soon. I, I don't think dudes can fully rock without women rocking. Oh, cool. Yeah, that's right. Wow. Okay. Oh, shout out to all the women. This is like, this is like the field find Felix a girlfriend telleth out. Yeah, no, if it's, if it's, Felix, you will not, you know, you will not, you will not get a smoke show by going full Connor on our podcast. No, I mean, this is, no, this is a new thing that's neither Connor nor Mubarak. This is like sort of a sigma type. Oh, it's a sigma male. You remove yourself from the hierarchy. Yeah, his name is like at, he's French Canadian. It's at the end of being an at the end. Felix is going to remake the rupee cower of the honey video soon. Oh, you guys, you guys see that? Did you see it? Actually, can we keep you watch out? Yeah, I did. Oh, I'm excited to Chris right now. This is all women's favorite artist. Ooh. rupee cower. Okay, hold on a sec. It's the only, the poet test. It's the only poet that women are allowed to like, she's very Instagramable. All right, here we go. Yeah. Putting in the chat now. Let's get some of that, let's get some of that live laugh love going. Let's poetry. You must have known you were wrong when your fingers were dipped inside me searching for honey that would not come for you. I mean, it's okay. Okay, okay. Okay, okay. Okay, okay. Okay, okay. You guys have fingers in there searching for honey. You're looking in the wrong plot. Looking in the wrong space. Okay, this is, I am notorious for my finger blessing technique where that's a scientific name. I don't know why people are laughing. That's what my doctor calls it when he tells me to stop doing this. But you know, you put it in there. You want to kind of like put your ring finger over your middle finger because this gives you hypertrophy in the forearm. And he put it in there. And then what I do is I put it in there. I make sort of like an ampersand shape. And then I pull it out and I lick my fingers off. And I go, ooh, that's a stop. And that's good stuff. And there have been a lot of articles written about me in babe.com about how good I am at that. The sort of the opposite of these and sorry articles are like local man does awesome thing. I just want to know why this lady is trying to have sex with Winnie the Pooh. How are you going to say yes to a dude who's who's pick up Linus? Oh, bother. Come on. We're so for seven. Please. He's been an entertainment for like 70 years. He's so rich. I actually, he's like a fucking pants then. He's so got the average. My first draft of this poem was the same except he was fishing around in there like with Dorito dust hands. You know, like looking for that last chip. He's looking for his keys. Well women, that's good for women's like entire thing when you get that dust in there. You should treat a woman's pussy just like a couch. You know, things fall in there all the time. You got to like, you got to vacuum, you know. There's always some kind of mystery crumb. Sometimes there's something sticky in there. A woman is not a crusted bread that fell off your back after you fell asleep on your couch. A man isn't a sabote that you found outside and you're like, I rescued it. You're right. They're never as cute or as intelligent or as, you know, good to train with tricks. Yeah. Most men can't do the tricks a sabote can do. Any more questions for boys? Yes. Can women be funny? No, like, can we really be funny? Do add this with your answers. I am, you guys are going to call me a conner for this. But this is like, this is unironic. Women and men are like funny and unfunny at the same rates. I feel like, like, everyone's the whole thing of women aren't funny. It's like, there are a lot of men who make other men laugh just by quoting anchor man. And that's not like really being, there's no like really woman equivalent to that. But like the way women are funny is incredibly fucking mean and like elaborate in my experience, in my experience with like, maybe it's just the women in my family. But I don't think it is. I think the female equivalent of the anchor man thing, I do think there's still a subspecies of women where like, they still quote mean girls to each other. I think that's the only way. Yeah, no, that's true. That's true. I think my addendum to this is that that type of funny woman is very underrepresented in media because the type of shit they do give you is like, who loves shopping? And that's like, I don't know, I think about a lot of like very cruel funny women I know. And it's just like, there's not a lot in media that is like that. It's, I mean, I think because people react like really negative to that. Because a man and a woman tell like equally mean jokes, people will get madder at the woman because the woman's supposed to be good, you know? I mean, I think it's just a matter of different energies, you know? Like it's just like, if you see a guy and he's being funny, it's like it's making you laugh. You see a woman and she's being funny, it's making you think. Sort of going down. That's true. That's a joke that, you know, like it's, it made me go, hmm, you know, makes you think about how we live in a society where is, you know, male, male laughs are kind of ephemeral. You know, you don't think about that joke again. Yeah, like a male laughter is like when I see someone get hurt. I'm like, female laughter is like when I see like my country hurting, you know? Some of the funniest accounts I follow are also like things I'm afraid to even faith because it would cause like a five day thing if people saw it. Like so fucking mean. That's mostly girls. So women are funnier than men is what you're saying. Just different energies, different energies. Different energies. Different energies. Like they have a far greater capacity for like verbal cruelty in a way that I think is amazing. I mean like women, I mean like if a lot of people out there say women aren't funny, but like they, I mean like they're just, they're, they're thinking of like one person in particular who's not funny. They're not thinking of like, for instance, a wealthy Dowager getting pie on her or like falling down some stairs. What about what if a suburban mom dance to a rap song? Damn, not that's funny. That would be pretty funny. You know what I mean, there's a lot of that on TikTok. So maybe it's just like TikTok is, is, is the female comedy app? There are a lot of people. Women on TikTok are getting, getting funnier and it's making men nervous. I mean like men would rather answer girls questions on TikTok than go to therapy. That's right. Is that a joke? I don't know, but it kind of makes you think though. It makes you think. Like and share. What can I see if I can get banned from TikTok for a very specific type of hate speech? I think you would do well on TikTok Felix. I have to find a face narrowing lens. Then I'm going to go on TikTok. Just do it man. Just let the face sell ads on the face. Yeah. Yeah. One cheekbone starts in my bathroom. One goes to the foyer of my building. I can write things like capitalism and depression on them. Well, there we go. I mean, for those, you know, the thing is like funny or not, you know, like if you ask women to do something like come up with some TikTok questions for you, you got it, you got a, you know, I asked for TikTok questions. She gave me six, 75 dollars. No, I'm giving her, I'm giving her 100. You guys have the model relationship. Like will you take Catherine to, you'll go on like a cute day trip to Hawaii? From New York. Very true. I mean, obviously not recently, but you know, it's just like, okay, if Catherine's up every day before 8 o'clock doing her job, all true. Just reading books. Yes, sir. Getting smarter. Looking beautiful. For that, you got to pay. You got to, you got to, you got to, you got to give us some money. That's right. It's just the way to, the way to be nice, the way to relate to women is by giving them money. This is what I, this is what I've learned. Giving them Louis Vuittons and putting them all in a closet for them to find someday. I just, I have, I have probably 70 Birken bags. Like I just, I give the Catherine like just as surprises. You know, we've gone through about 30 of them so far with the Cartharmale relationship, but I want to keep things fun and interesting by, you know, just breaking them out, breaking them out when Catherine does something good. Like get up in the morning. This woman can't get up in the morning after a war that like it, if you have a good relationship, like willing Catherine have, it should cost the man 17.5 million dollars a year. It does. It does. And it does. Yeah, no, it does. And thanks to the credit derivative swabs we've been selling, you know, we'll be able to fund that lifestyle. I'm actually trying to get into, I'm only going to start charging you in Bitcoin soon. You know, I was big early into crypto for wife taxes. If you, if you can come up consistently with what you want to eat for dinner or what TV show you want to watch, that's another Birken bag right there. That's the feels incredibly targeted. That's not okay. All right, that was, that was questions for boys. Buy a girl. Let's start. We're back. And as you might have surmised already, our guest for today's show, joining me along with Felix and Matt is of course Catherine Krieger of Discourse Blog. Hello. Hello. This is a big get. This is a coup for us. Yeah, I had to, I didn't even have to change rooms. I just had to move six inches over. Catherine was like what, like our like third guest ever? I was a little bit later than that. Like pretty early on in the show. I think I was like your third subscriber. And when Will and I started dating, I was like, you know, at what point can I just like, can I just trim that extra five bucks a month, but I'm still hanging on because that's, that's women supporting men right there. Thank you. Yes. All right. We'll start the show for real this time. And you guys see Joe Biden following us, walking upstairs, stair, first one classic. It's pretty good. Yeah. Immediately classic. There's nothing funny about that. About how the carpet fell off the stairs and he got rolled up into it. It's fun for two hours and they couldn't stop him. A bunch of eagles picked up the carpet and dropped it down a chimney and he rolled down a chimney and like fell that fell out and spit so it out of his mouth and said, whoa, special delivery man. And every time he tried to stand up, he stood on another rake and got beamed in the nose. Just reminded me of like one of the, well, I actually got, I got in trouble when splinter RIP still existed at multiple times. But one of the things I got in the most trouble for next to the 9-11 tweet was I had this headline about Mitch McConnell when he fell down and it was bitch McConnell fall down. I didn't know we had polio or you know, head had polio so they made me like, you know, change the headline. You know, so old that mother. It was seen as ableist, you know, in some circles of the internet. So you know, I made sure Google has shown. Polio Twitter went wild. Oh, yeah, I was googling. Has Joe Biden had polio just to make sure I was on firm ground with this one. Splinter got so many angry telegrams after the whole little bit. Catherine has like a specific like everyone has like a group of people that yell at them the most for me. It's active members of the side. But for Catherine, it's like conservatives who like pretend to be offended by things where it's yeah, absolutely. A guy, a guy who works for the child molestation institute who's like, wow, real nice for anyone reading polio who saw this. He's like, he's the only living guy with any polio scar. I write for childbuggers.com. And I think it's frankly disturbing that you would be allowed to tweet this. Yeah. I mean, the funny thing about Joe Biden trying repeatedly and failing to walk upstairs is that like it's immediately, it's just in the funniest way possible. I like people have chosen their sides on this in a way that directly directly contradicts exactly the position they were taking when Trump was president on both sides. Like it's really good. I'm looking at a fan of this website. I don't know if you guys have heard of it. It's called snopes.com. It's sort of a sort of a good resource to determine what things are true. Yeah. Can we get a can we get a fact check on this? Yeah. No. So this is snopes.com. What? Did Biden fall on stairs to Air Force One rating mostly false? Excuse me. What? We all saw so many jokes. We all saw. I watched that she fell his ass fell down. No pre-tops. Don't do this gaslighting us. Snopes is gaslighting us. It says your mostly false and it says what's true? What did Biden appear to have stumbled and slightly lost his footing while climbing the stairs onto Air Force One? He felt three times. He felt three times. It was not slightly. Again and again and again. Yeah. And it goes what's false? President Biden did not fall completely. The president gained his footing in composure moments after a brief thumb wall. President Kennedy had a brief issue finishing the motor. Mostly able to finish it. The back of President Kennedy's skull took a slight tumble. This is not an original observation, but you can really can trace the degradation of internet culture in the way that snopes went from a very handy source to find out like is Mikey the kid from the life cereal? Did he actually explode for meeting pop rocks or not? And just be able to clear through some of the, you know, the brick-a-brack of urban legends to now it's just DNC press releases. It's just pure problem. And actually Obamacare is better than Medicare for all. I think. Mostly true. Like, like, actually it turns out that the whole thing about like us some sort of objective criteria like determining the validity of a of a of a truth statement. No, we're here to just like kind of tell you how you should feel about the news. A watershed snopes moment for me was googling whether or not Brian Peppers was dead. So that's how far we've fallen. I hope not. I love those ex-man movies. But, you know, like all the, all the fucking like the guys who like made their, made their bones just like sharing a video of trying to do anything. Like people found like all their tweets from like when he was drinking water funny or when he slid down that ramp awkwardly where they were like, um, walking up the stairs challenge, uh, go. How about, how about I would love to see Biden? And Trump have a stair walking competition. A water drinking off. Yeah. I like, I want a president who can sip water the normal way. And then like, and then hilariously for their point, like all the, all the, all the Trump people are like, this is, this is really, I mean, we can't have a president who can't walk upstairs. Like, you know, like, like ignoring the like hundreds of like jaw drop and leased stupid and just generally like, uh, strange and questionable things that Trump did and said. I'm like, not just like said, but like with his body, the way the way his body moves through his shape, he moves so bizarre. The way he carries, I'm missing the way he carries his body through space. Honestly, nobody did bodies and spaces like Trump did. I mean, that's, he did it was a lot of the guy. He was a body in a space. He sure was. He's a unique way of breathing and walking that, you know, grasping objects. It's just, it's just not a way that would inspire confidence when it's the leader of your country. You know what I mean? Did you, okay, and best of all, did you see, did you see Madison, Hawthorne's take where he was just like, the, he was like, the world is a windy place. We need a president who can stand and I was like, oh, yeah. Maybe he like doesn't know he can't walk. He's like, lock from lost. I do love all of it. I can't leave DC. See only place like a walk. I do love the liberals who are just like, yeah, but Trump, Trump, Trump was, he, he never fell down. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Yes, he had the thing with the stairs where he held the hand of the general, which was funny, but he never fell on his ass. I'm sorry. This, and if he had, you would have shit yourself about how you need, he needed the fucking 25th amendment immediately. I'm going to read a take about how I actually don't want a president who can walk upstairs without tripping and like, that's, it's a, it's an op of some kinds. He's doing dominance politics. Do you think that, do you think that Trump, like, he was able to walk up the stairs and he just wanted to hold the general's hand? That's like kind of what I think. He does love, he loves the general's, he loves the general's. He loves the general's. Hey guys, how, how much money would you would have given, would you have given to just like see Trump be able to live tweet that, that reaction to him watching the falling down. I just, though, we need him back on Twitter, we need him back on Twitter. We've lost so much. Apparently you guys, he's going to launch his own platform soon. Give, give your routing number, social security number and checking account number to join the, join Trump app. Yeah. No, you'll be instantly identity that stolen, but you get to see the tweets. It's worth it. And once that happens, then we can just get the screenshots on Twitter. But like, I just think like a big part about like if we're ever going to return to normal, like we need to give, we need to let, we just need to acknowledge like, yeah, like, okay, it was bad when he was president and it was dangerous. But now that he's just a guy with a golf course, it's funny as hell. Like we need his thoughts. There needs to be a path back for former president. It could be funny again. You know, that shouldn't just be, be cast out of the public square forever. I mean, especially since you can't even honestly really make an argument anymore that he was worse than Biden on any of the major stuff. Like, Biden's turning the screws on Iran the same way that Trump did. He's doing, doing Bringsman ship with China the way that Trump did. There's 5,000 kids in cages right now. Fucking stacking up migrant children at the border the way that Trump did. By the way, what is the incentive here? What is the distinction I'm supposed to make? It really is like what kind of old guy do you think? What kind of seniority do you like watching? And I say both. Why not both is the girl from the from the El Paso taco commercial set. Have them both be president. I actually just check snopes and the girl from the El Paso salsa commercial did not fall into a corn thresher after filming that line. That was mostly false. But yeah, like it's just, it's just a competition now again to like who can directly invalidate their position on it. Is it important that their president be able to walk from like three months ago to today? Because yeah, like it just, I mean, you remember how funny it was when Trump got COVID? I was hilarious. That was very funny. That was a great day. That was one of the funniest like week long periods of the entire presidency. And then when he got suited up on steroids and was talked about who got gay and wanted to kiss everybody. And then he did that weird walk to the helicopter. It was great. No, but like, and now if you laugh at Biden falling down stairs, like you have to deal with like the course of people who are like, um, yeah, like I know you think you're funny about your joke about Biden falling down the stairs are funny and you're laughing at it. But all your friends who are also 85 year old presidents with the final mental capacity are also seeing these. And they don't think it's so funny. Well, I'll tell you right now, if somebody who falls down a lot, it's very funny. And I give anybody permission to laugh at it. They have it. Yeah, you have it. Well, moving on to another topic that I'm thinking about this week is like, we talked briefly about the Harry and Megan interview with Oprah. And you know, like they're they're they're taking down the royal family. You know, I mean, it's over. It's over. It's over. The free ride is over for these bombs. They're getting kicked out the British Empire, the Commonwealth, common poor, more like it. Because this shit is done. This shit is done. If people found out that these fucking amazes just amaciated lizards have like slightly retrograde social attitudes regarding race and gender, then I think the whole fucking house of cards is coming down. But the interesting thing here now is that like because this has now been, you know, absorbed into this like, you know, culture war, like, you know, just race and gender debate, like conservatives now have to take a position on it that it like, you know, I wouldn't say it directly contradicts their previous like, it's like they've ever, they've always had kind of an affection for monarchy because they obviously hate democracy. But it's sort of like the British monarchy in particular, like they, I think they, it might crazier to they seem to like used to have a little bit more brio about the American revolution and like, you know, overcrowling King George, the tyrant and stuff like that. But now like, I just have this piece here in national review about how good, uh, it Britain's monarchy is and how important it is for America. And it's just, there's just an odd thing going on here now where it's just like, they, they, because they view that like the left is attacking, you know, Prince Philip and Queen Elizabeth, they have to defend them. The left poses an existential threat to the British monarchy. You know, I mean, someone, someone's got to defend them. Yeah. Now this is like, I have to say like, I'm used to some pretty lame shit with like left right culture wars, but this is the shittiest one. Oh, brutal. We got it. We got it. We're getting the resin out of the pipe here. We're running it. We got to go. Yeah. Fucking look at those across the pond to fucking get mad about something. Mr. Patina, that doesn't cut it anymore. And that was like two weeks ago. I knew this guy from who is like an opiate addict and he told me that he would, uh, like when he was out of pills, he would lick white t-shirts that had residue of the pill. Oh, he's actually doing really well. I just like always shout out to that guy. No, that guy, no, that guy is like fucking honest shit now. It's a good guy, but I mean, it's like the, he probably has no idea that this podcast exists or I use that as an example, but that's what, that's what, uh, I'll give his full name in the premium episode. You guys will want to. Yeah, everyone go, go find that guy. Let him know. This is the equivalent of that because it's like, we got a hint of this in, you know, Trump visited the UK and was like, Oh, look at all this shade. Queen Elizabeth is doing it. It's like, yeah, they've never met a got, they've never met anyone as awful as Donald Trump, a racist sex guy who hangs out with a racist guy who's like kind of a pedophile or something like that's the first they've ever seen of someone like that. That's not at all what every man in that family is fucking like. This was like, didn't this interview happen like about a week or so after the report came out? Just apropos of nothing that the, that, uh, Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip travel with blood. Yeah, blood. But their own supply of blood, their blood. Problem, problem. Problem. Problem. Bloodborne's real. I don't, I don't know who doesn't do that every, all, all my homies do that. I mean, what are people if not blood bags? I mean, like your, your body, is it a sense like a portable blood transportation vehicle? Yes. So why is it so messed up to take your own blood out of your body and then you're, you're putting it back late? Zero percent chance that it's their blood by the way. That's probably a ton of it. My body, my choice. They fought that blood on the, on the fucking black market. They got it at, uh, at Jimmy Savile Row. That's where they went down the party. That's like what I thought. It's like limited hangout. It's like, oh no, we travel with blood. Definitely our own. The blood's their own silly. It's not. It's not from orphans. And you know, like this idea that like, oh, the left is attacking the monarchy. I mean, I suppose if you're on the left, like being anti-monarchist is, you know, a pretty, pretty standard position. But I gotta say if you're talking about America, there's only been one man who's taken the correct position on the royal family this entire time. And he is neither left nor right. He is lending to LaRouche and he knows that Queen Elizabeth is the world's biggest drug dealer. Yep. He never spared those limey freaks. No, he's like, he's, he's like, he's, he's actually never like, there is never a moment where anyone could have told him, erm, or like, you better, but especially not now. Like he was so right about everything. I mean, also the thing about classical music. Of course. It's very, very deep. That's the only legitimate pitch. That's massive facts. We should bring him back to life. I mean, I know that technology exists. Yeah, 100% does. Yeah. You should bring him back. Joe Biden probably dies like every day. And it's like they just, they just bring him back. Yeah. And yeah. Why not? Why not him? Just reading here the National Review here, it says, the left's demolition campaign has a better chance of succeeding today thanks to the stupifying ignorance of the history of Britain's constitutional monarchy, which afflicts even the most highly educated. Now is a ripe time to refresh our memories of the monarchy and recall the debt which Americans owe, the political ideals and institutions that helped create. So he's going to give a little history lesson here about the monarchy. He says here, no other political system at the time anywhere in the world upheld these basic concepts of justice. Foundational to the American Constitutional Order, they still have no place in many parts of the world today. The British monarchy, despite its often contentious relationship with Parliament, became an indispensable ally in the struggle for self-government. The glorious revolution marked another milestone in constitutionalism. And so you just go on here about all the revolutions and wars that were fought in England to wrench back some fucking power from their ordained by God, ruling family, and they're just like, yeah, it's all good. They were pioneers in allowing a parliament to exist. But he is kind of right though that the founding fathers do sort of like, oh, a debt of gratitude to the royal family. People like to think of the American Revolution, it's this break with the dominant sort of world empire. When really it was just sort of like an insurrection to put it under new management. A changing of hands. And to the extent that the Britain's constitutional monarchy contains within it the seeds of our own republic and the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, to the extent that's correct. I mean, that is the reason why those things stink in our government. Yeah, it sucks. Even as bad in large part because the people who wrote it wanted to maintain the order, the social order that propagated by British monarchism with a gloss of popular legitimacy. You know what? The way you guys are sounding, you sound like you need to be in a movie, a Christian movie, where you get run over by a car and you wake up and you're given CPR by Ben Franklin. You just go back alive. And he like takes you on a tour of Colonial Williamsburg and explains how the Constitution helps everyone. And then you like you meet us, you're like, no, hey, what the hell, what the hell is going on? Remember when we watched that movie where that happened? And Franklin wearing khakis, disarmed a home invader. That was pretty great. Ben Franklin invented a keto. A lot of people like, it's another case of the Japanese stealing things that fat white Americans invented. The electricity, Akito, the stove, Bible, and these are all things the Japanese claim to have invented. It's fucked up. A lot of people know that. And he had to tell his oldest time. A lot of people know that there's Ben Franklin also invented the finger blessing technique. It if he looks said that claim that he was pioneering earlier, the sort of an impersonation style local thing. Wow. He was Ben Franklin. Yeah. See, all those French widows, he was just making, oh, it's God, it was just, it was just he was playing my land. He was surfing. Yeah, he was surfing. Do you know what, do you know what he called that? What? Problem? You know what he called that when he invented it? What? He called it the famished cobbler. Classic finger blessing technique. That's, everyone knows this one. Those are my favorite history writings are the ones where it's like, they talk about some big fat guy from history. And he had, he was a man of enormous appetites in every sense. They're like, they're like, he would eat an entire rotisserie chicken and then 15 clams and a bunch of cream that someone put in a top hat. And then you would have greasy sex where he just fell asleep inside a 23 year old. And he was the greatest man who ever. You know, it's just, it's interesting. I'm the professor. I'm the professor of him. Before at Brown University. And this is why the monarchy is worth upholding. Before 1977, approximately the longest any man lasted during intercourse was 45 seconds. And it was Ben Franklin's at the record. Well, the only guys who could like, have sex longer were, this was another type of guy that doesn't exist anymore. Unfortunately, like we don't really have Ben Franklin's and we definitely don't have this guy. The toughest guy in the world who was gay in a way where he just was disgusted by seeing women. So he joined the military and became the greatest military ruler of his age. And there were a lot of those guys. And when they would have to have kids. Alexander the guest. So yeah, when they would have to have kids, it would probably take them a really long time to bust. But you know, unfortunately, you know, when you need a prince, you know, the job must get done simply. I mean, you got to stiff up or left. Yeah. Well, credit to Frederick the great because he was like probably the king of those guys. He just never, he like never even like met his wife. Yes. They were like, you have to make a prince. You're like the monarch and he was like, oh, y'all fuck you. I'm not doing that. Get this gross bitch out of here. He sent her a nut in like a stamped envelope. Yeah, go do something with it. I don't care. Fuck you. You're disgusting. I hate you. I'm the envelope and then press one of those seals onto the. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, she had to throw it off melted. Just this is the next review guy Joseph LeConte, chair of of of Queen studies at King's College. No, he says here, the impact of all this in the American founders was profound, not only on the concepts embedded in the Declaration of Independence and Bill of Rights, but also on the very structure of the Constitution itself. So there you go. He's saying it. Not me. He's going to say there's a little bit more history lessons about the history of the Britain's monarchy. It is true, of course, that Great Britain built a massive colonial empire that was deeply engaged in the African slave trade. The monarchy approved through royal charter, the forcible enslavement of millions of human beings with the support of parliament and the royal navy. Great Britain earned the lamentable status as the lead slave trading nation in the world. The left views this history as an indelible stain on the monarchy. It is a racist institution to its core, they claim. Yet, the monarchy as the political guardian of the Church of England was eventually confronted by the Christian conscious of parliament, quickened by evangelical reformers such as William Wilberforce and Hannah Moore. Once parliament outlawed the slave trade in 1807, the British crown authorized the royal navy to enforce the new law on the high seas. Decades before the United States faced the issue head on in the Civil War, the British monarchy led the world in abolishing the institution of slavery. Number one. Number one for slavery. Number one for abolishing slavery. That's right. Exactly, it all evens out. The left doesn't understand this history. Nowhere in his little attempts to be like, you take the good with the bad, does he say anything about them giving back a dime of the literally trillions of dollars in wealth that they're being the world's leading slave trading nation generated? Maybe one of those jewels that's on Elizabeth head was like basically came at the expense of like thousands of lives. Yeah, but they enforce the rule on the high seas. Also, there's no earn that description. Is there any agency? It's just stuff that they acceded to because by that point, it was basically a fucking figurehead position. It's like some fucking disgusting ghouls are like, oh, we want a chart about so we can steal some Nixamak frikunz into America and some fucking syphilitic German guy just go who thinks that it's like who's hallucinating that it's like fucking like King Arthur talking who goes, yeah, go ahead. And then another syphilitic German guy, hey, we're stopping slavery. Okay, go for it. Yeah, it's either way not involved. It's like earlier when he was talking about like, oh, like the Britain's constitutional monarchy was at the forefront of having a parliament. It's like, yeah, because like they agreed to it because they were forced to. Yeah. Which is like, they acceded all the time. It's they weaken their power weakened over time because capitalism overtook feudalism and monarchy is a feudal fucking a feudal political arrangement. That's it. They weren't like being persuaded of anything. They were just being having things dictated to them by psychotic, town dwelling Puritans. All right. It goes on here. And what about Britain's history as a colonial power? No one disputes that there were many dark episodes of a monarchy's quest to expand and defend its empire. Many nations have a history of colonial adventurism. France, Spain, Portugal, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, Germany, Russia, Turkey, China, Japan, the United States. Good, I'll let you through the United States in there at the end. Otherwise, it would lack credibility. He goes, all have been engaged to varying degrees in empire building. Under Queen Victoria at the peak of its power in the 19th century, the British empire had no imperial arrival. The legacy of its rule, though, is nothing like the dark kingdom of Mordor feverishly imagined by the left. No, it's far worse. It's far worse because it's not made up. At least Mordor had a goal. Yeah. You know? And Mordor, when they wanted to create slave armies, they would just pull orcs out of a ground. It wasn't like they were just capturing people and pressing them into service. I can't engage on the factualness of whatever Mordor is, but the effect of listening all these countries is also to suggest that they were all just as their adventurism and colonialism was all just as bad as British colonialism. No, it's funny because he's saying that, yeah, colonialism is bad. Every country's got some skeletons in their closet, but it just so happens that England was the biggest empire. So we have the most skeletons in our closet. I mean, our closet, this guy isn't even British. The guy writing is a fucking American guy. I mean, I just love these attempts that he has to be like, you know, he said at the beginning that it's easy to bash the history of the monarchy when you have a like a stupifying ignorance of history. And he's trying to give a history lesson here and doing like with stupifying ignorance, the worst job possible and like, I don't know, exonerating these people from any of the things that they've done or like or make the case that there's any reason to continue having a royal family in any fucking country, especially England. He's not really crediting the monarchy with anything. This is just a mystery. No, yeah, it's totally passive in this. I mean, he's saying what you need is a place for people to just hang around and wear nice wear shiny hats and to be curtsy to they want they want there to always be a class of people who are just on top for no reason because that's literally the premise of the system that they support is is is unearned in any sense. Well, and there's nobody on earth who has more who has less earned wealth than the royal family. He says here goes on to say no empire other than Great Britain brought to its colonies the technological tools, railroads, modern medicine, etc. Those are only two examples he can think of are real roads and modern medicine. He thought of, etc. Also, yeah, and the political ideals capitalism, the rule of law, etc. that made possible the development of stable egalitarian societies without the spread of British rule around the world. It is hard to believe that the structures of liberal capitalism would have been so successfully established in so many economies around the world writes historian Nile Ferguson in his book Empire. I mean, yeah, there's Nile Ferguson again. I mean, all it took was like a Holocaust level of people killed to make sure that the world was safe for liberal democratic capital. On one hand, you have inventing slavery and doing colonialism around the world. And on the other hand, you have the creation of liberal capitalism. Who's to say one wasn't worth the other? Yeah, exactly. Well, they were intertwined in one necessity, they both necessitated the other. They're part of a process. And that's why talking about the past in moral terms is generally stupid because the good stuff and the bad stuff, however you define it, aren't really extricable. You can't pull one out and say, this was good. We should have just done this because the bad stuff is what necessitated, what allowed and in fact required the good stuff to happen in both ways. It goes in both directions. This is always pointless for anybody on the left and right to like fixate on morality in the history. But like in this case, it's generated by the fact that for some insane reason, there are still fucking British royals hanging around. I like when he said, like we brought real, the British crown brought railroads in modern medicine to its colonies. The modern medicine he's talking about is opium. It's from the earth. Yeah. No, no. They look, they blew up, they bombarded Hong Kong and burned down Beijing because the Chinese would not accept it. It's from the earth. It's not. Yeah. The Chinese were, the Chinese were trying to smoke like sort of evil laboratory made drugs. These very serious drugs that you or a family member, maybe even your parents have been addicted to, things like grow. He goes on to say, nations that have violently rejected Britain's model of constitutionalism, China, Russia, the Arab states have created human misery on an industrial scale. It's like what unlike the British Empire? Like I just, again, like I just always attempt to exonerate it, just be like, well, you know, other nations have created a human misery and exploitation on an industrial scale, but you feel bad about insulting Prince Philip now. Well, it's also like, first of all, I like how he just says the Arab states, you know, those completely uniform governments that are all basically the same. But like anything bad about how those states formed was because of things either the British or French or both did. Yeah. As the legacy of colonialism, it's like you created them, you fucking prick. You drew the map. I mean, not much about serious says Joseph LeConte is the director of the Beaconet Simon Center for American Studies at the Heritage Foundation. He is the author of a Hobbit, a wardrobe and a great war, which is being made into a documentary film. Fuck off. Fuck off. Fuck off. I was making myself mad the other day thinking of like an arrow like Heritage Foundation and titles for articles. And I was, that's worse than anyone who came up with. I got as far as the Jouah Sans of Billiard. I mean, I guess this is my last point here on like the American rights, newfound affection for the British crown is that like in a way it's healthy because like this is all part in parcel of as Matt, you pointed out earlier, like this is their long term project and like they'll pick up anything that sort of like will bolster that. And like by long term project, I mean the ending democracy, like they are explicitly probably now more than ever, explicitly anti-democratic. And like they know full well now if you listen to like the hearings today on DC statehood that to the extent that America can become more of an actual democracy is only taking power away from them. Like if there is anything actually like, you know, a one person, one vote in this country they would not fare very well at the polls. So I mean like it's just, it's just, it's just their attempt to like to claw back. Like I said, the big you said Matt, like the British royal family is like a symbol of power that they find legitimate precisely because it is not democratic. That it is ordained by God and it is a like is a hierarchy that is removed from democratic political concerns and like a popular will. And like that's what they find and like you know wish to emulate. I mean like I think a lot of conservatives even just call themselves monarchyists now because like they you know, quite rightly and like honestly, despise democracy. And like you know you made this I should, I mean at this point I basically hated too. But it's just you know like there is no reason for any country to have some fucking goofy family wearing jewels stolen from the entire planet, learning it over the rest of us. What are what's the crown going to be based on if the monarchy species to exist though? Celebrity celebrity. I think honestly America should have a royal family but it should be like a rotating, appointed by like who is the best celebrity. Well, so don't you think he's kind of like pining for like I wish America had a monarchy because it would be like a great distraction. You know, if everyone was just watching these mascots like the right wing could continue its march on, you know, reducing democracies or consolidating power even as they become less and less powerful. Yeah, absolutely. And like honestly, it's a great distraction. It's a show. It's entertainment. I think also they look up to the Tory party as well who's like one of the most successful political parties despite being just grotesque and like failures in every other regard. Like democratically speaking, the Tories are doing great as they continue to like just just strip away like any veneer of like public services or democracy in England at this time. And like I said, like I think a lot of the right looks to like England as sort of a hope for the future. England and Brazil, I think are there two big hopes for the future, but not if Brazil gets to actually vote for Lula, then it'll be then it'll be another target for regime change. I guess he bolts in arrow had his birthday party. That was such a funny video. If him washing his hands and a fountain before cutting it. Yeah, he went out. Yeah, he was like he so they were like they brought out his like stupid cake that was probably like, I don't know, they probably like shaped it like Arnold in commando and he didn't have a play. He was just going to eat. He was like, Oh, I should watch my hands. And he went over to this like fucking disgusting like break green moat and just dipped his hand in. He's like, all right, I'm ready. 20 copy boroughs were sitting in it before he's hands in it. Yeah. He's last question and topic for today. The y'all like sex? Nah. No. Okay. Well, you were now in you were clearly now firmly in the mainstream of the American. That's on trend. Being sex negative is on trend. It's, you know, is anyone having sex anymore? This is a question that's come up recently. I mean, I don't know if you guys saw that graph posted yesterday, but it basically purported to show that since 2008, there's been a huge increase in the number of men under 30 who have never had a sex partner or a female sexual partner. So I don't know if that counts guys who are gay, but I mean, that could be throwing off the numbers. But the point is, you know, from black matter, the rise of the in the cell. I mean, this is a topic we've talked about before. The research was just a guy saying, fellas, y'all like sex and everyone saying no. You know, like this is the question people are beginning to get on concerned about is like, you know, are Americans having enough sex? Are people just sort of withdrawing from pursuing sex? Are like among young men in particular, like is America post-COVID post everything like headed for kind of a Hikiko Mori, like Japanese style, like we're just like population is declining. No one is having sex, like no one is reproducing. There's just no because it's not just about people not having sex, right? It's about sex as a normal part. And in their minds as a normal part leading to reproduction. Or just like, you know, adulthood or just, you know, romance, fun, excitement, it just seems to be like, yeah, like people, like, no one's having sex anymore. No one's horny. Or it seems that way, at least according to the data. And you know, confront this question, of course, is our old friend Ross Douthet, who, the guy who loves sex. I mean, he, I mean, this dude, he loves to pipe. He loves. Okay, can I just say I don't like that the new, your new phrase has become too pipe. I thought it was, it's laying pipe. It's not too pipe is not the verb. Don't look at me. I got to live with her. No, I mean, like, so he's concerned about this, you know, as we all should be. And you know what, like he's got a new opinion piece in the New York Times that proves beyond any shadow of a doubt as far as I'm concerned that he listens to every single show of ours. Because he is giving me a shout out. Hey, Ross. What's up, dude? Uh, yo, like could we get a shout out maybe in your next column because we have been on the tip about there's been no boobs and movies. I mean, just almost, almost as much as our crusade for squibs to bring real, oh my god, real, real violence back to movies. We've been talking forever and about how there are no, but there's no more boobage in everything. It's out. Yeah, there's no more visceral anything. It's, it's, it's totally derasinated. It's, it's smoothed out. Well, until they, to the extent that there's still violence, it's all CGI and there's almost no sex or, you know, the sex that they do show is a very like clinical. It's all in like kind of pre-approved modalities. It's not, you know, like the sex of, of, of your, the sex that you grew up on, pausing and rewinding the VHS. Um, but yeah, like, you know, as, as a sort of like a recurring theme on the show, it's just like these, these social problems do, yeah, it's not having sex. Oh, is, is the way in which like the, the, all these issues get filtered into like a culture war loans and like this one becomes like, you know, our men trash or not. And when really what we're talking about here is like that the economy was destroyed in 2008. And like that, that, that, to me would be like the knock on effect about our men are like the decline in marriage or reproduction is that just like any sort of path to economic stability or adulthood. Like is, is, is connected to material issues about like poverty and prosperity, like wealth and who's allowed to have it. Well, now the economy is fucked again. So I think we're going to see those exact same hallmarks of, oh, are, you know, basically our young men reaching these milestones of, you know, sexual maturity and adulthood. I think we're also going to see those increasingly just kind of fall by the wayside because no one has economic. There's like, there's, there's less marriageable men because there's less like, right jobs. Well, yeah, I mean, they're not, they're not fewer prospects men and women. Well, they're not even like getting started because it's like, you won't go to college or you like do remote learning. You'll be sort of like half in, half out still living in your parents house. You like, you maybe like don't get a group of friends as easily as you did. Maybe like 20 years ago or so. Just like the situations that you get in where you do have sex as a young man or young woman just aren't as common now even before COVID. I mean, I do think this is like a very interesting topic because I mean, as always, there was a mash into the day and there's of course one, you know, last week. And every time this happens, there's this like a sort of thing that I basically do understand where it's like people take like the last media thing they remember or that they have resentment over and they're like, oh, see, well, what about this that thing that vaguely connects to the mass murder that just happened, which like I think is, you know, at best stupid and it was like can just be like totally cynical and monstrous just basically like blaming some other idiot and media for just mass murder. But I feel like the reasons we have these, I mean, they're not simple, but I feel like they're pretty identifiable. And one is that, you know, we live in a imperial nation that has repeatedly shown complete, just complete disregard for human life for the human life, as long as they're something other than you in whatever way it's constructed. That you can kill literally millions of them and it's basically fine if your intention was to make the world better that it's you know that even it could just be a mistake like a rock is just a mistake, you know, we're just running into a bad time in Afghanistan, even if you're against the war will be framed that way. And it just it makes human life very forgivable to lose just like, you know, the tens of thousands that die of completely preventable ways because of our health care system because of how we see work everything, everything. And then you have increasing male isolation and alienation like huge chunks of like kids just like don't like forget having sex, they just like flat out don't have friends. Yeah. And and to combine that with the third piece, which is like very uniquely American, a very like toxic individualism. So if you're like there's no way for you to go. You're already sort of pre program to like not see some sort of like valor on heroism and killing scores of people. And if you're wrong, you know, you had the best of intentions. And then combine that with like yeah, the toxic individuals and where it's like, well, you're going to be a fucking loser in this life, but you you will be your own media brand after you kill these people and die. And you will become immortal. It's like, yeah, no, fucking course these happen. I don't the problem is like there's no simple way to fix it. I mean, I honestly do think you'd see a lot less if there were a wave for a better way for like young men to have. Like friendships or like do anything or like even have sex. Of course, like isn't a cure all, but I think you'd see like less of it. But as for the rest of it, I mean, it's probably it's probably the king of easier said than done. I also really do think we're going to like be paying for the long term social effects of COVID for a really long time in young people. Yeah. Not only is it like economically stunted an entire generation, but I think it's socially stunted them. So I do, I think we're going to see kind of like a failure to launch generation because of this last year, you know, like this is this is not anywhere near as intense as, you know, losing your job and becoming homeless. But I just think about like my little brother is a freshman in college now. And you know, he basically missed out on his senior year of high school, which, you know, again, it's not like. A life or death, but you know, it's like one of those kind of milestones, don't just marks that everyone sort of like you know, missed out on like party in that summer and like they had a weird digital graduation. And now, you know, he went to the big state school freshman year, but didn't live in the dorms because of COVID. And you know, you can't really party. There aren't any big lecture halls, you know, it's just like his entire first year and part of, you know, his last year of high school has now been characterized by this kind of weird stuntedness. And now we're all about to be like foiced back into some sense of normalcy. And I just think like, you know, at this kind of at these tender moments where, you know, young men in particular are kind of like their brains are wiring for the rest of their lives in terms of can you make like the right social connections to other people. And like build communities, I think like there's there's going to be a trip missing that you know, it's going to take us a long time to to realize or to even like help people find a path back to addressing it. Yeah, and there's just no there's no like actual solution to that that I could think that they would make right. I don't even know what it would look like. Well, I mean, just to get back to Ross for a second, I mean, like what what he's identifying here and we know look, we know Ross is a fan of movies. I mean, we know he had a poster of glad loves the film. We know he had a poster of gladiator in his college dorm room. So like he loves classic movies. And what Ross is identifying as a kind of something that you know, we noticed too. I mean, he's coming out of from a different angle, obviously, but what he's talking about is like this sort of desexualization of popular culture like they like the on the onerotic American is what he's going for here. But like, you know, we've talked about it before like that that that sex and popular culture, at least as far as movies go. I mean, sex has sort of been like shunted aside to like sort of streaming or premium cable television. But like movies themselves is like he he does quote from that. I thought quite good RS Benedict essay about just why there's no more sex in movies and like they make the point about that like no one has like like male bodies and like like female like the form or whatever. No one has ever looked like hotter or more chiseled and like see these superhero movies, but no one's having sex like no one's fucking in movies. They're all sexless. It's all it's all very like that you keep it super marketable and family friendly. It's just that we have it. It's like it's like in movies, especially it's this very like neutered. Cultural terrain right now. It's like a sexuality without without an end point. And it's because like I think it's sort of like nobody really knows how to deal with sexuality and art anymore because it is it is so dangerous. And it's just like it's so it's so fraught about like are you depicted or like you know who gets to depict it or whatever. I'm like I think the interesting here thing here though is that Ross as a culture warrior himself is you know he is he is not movie mindset. He is cast out of movie mindset because he makes the same mistake that a lot of other people like you know on the left or liberal side do which is that he wants movies to make people better. He wants movies to like be the sort of like programming that will lead to a resurgence in marriage having children younger, buying homes and voting Republican. He's like if only we could bring back you know Spencer Tracy and Catherine Hepburn or carry grant or whatever. Just like like the romantic screwball comedy of of yesterday year like that'll give. But like you know he's willing to a seed that there can be like you know gross out boner comedy is as well like he you know he talks about like like he Ross just wants hits back in movies and he's willing to like sacrifice like the runchy sort of like a untoward router. Because at least maybe we'll give people fucking again. Yeah exactly like in exchange for I don't know juicing the birth rate or something but like again like he is he is he is he is he is he is correctly identified something that movie mindset is concerned with but he is he is not of the body. He is he is he is he is in tradition. He is he has to move it because he has the fundamentally the same problem in which that he wants movies to uphold his political point of view. Like that is that is what he views as the point of movies and to the extent that no one's fucking in movies anymore. That's a problem because like he wants you know people to get married younger and have families younger. But if you think about it all these sexless movies are perfect for this moment right like now no one knows how to date no one's fucking and so it makes perfect sense that like when you see you know you watch the snider cut or something and who do we look at we look at Superman like all of we we were watching it last night and I go you guys are going to talk about it not with women on the podcast but like there's no sex there's no romance like there's nothing like it really is like a kind of like a chicken or egg thing. About is our culture reflecting the sexlessness of these movies or these movies perfectly reflecting the sexlessness of our culture. It certainly didn't always but this was like wasn't the case because I think of like the first big superhero movie that I can think of the Tim Burton badmands Michael Keaton as Bruce Wayne my Batman in those movies is so horny like those movies are only about fucking like they are like he is very clear in the Tim Burton badminton that he is only fighting crime because he wants to fuck women in the cave wearing a mask. You know what I mean like watching the snider cut last night it was like there are hot people in it but there are there put in no context that could be read as sexual or containing any like sexual situation sexual tension right like it's it calls attention to the fact that it's like it's like negative space for sexuality. I think it's funny though because like Ross has been a culture war scold like as long as we've been following him and I think it's funny that he's willing to just like he's like bring bring back the boners and blow jobs and movies it's just like what is the Catholic Church say about this rod really a no rod rod. Yeah the Legion of decency had a pretty strong take that the culture should be protected from those sort of influences. Well I mean it's weird that this snider cut is sexless because Snyder is like he's notorious for one of the funniest sex scenes of all time. Oh hell yeah one of the last one of the last ones I can remember that's true nudity and everything slow motion and pumping with boobs yeah in in watchmen. Yep hallelujah. Yeah which is like the sex scene you would make if you never had sex. Yeah and to be fair like I haven't finished it so maybe like I'm still waiting for the Joker to appear so maybe when he comes on it's just going to be a 20 minute long un simulated sex scene. Roaps. Roaps. Roaps. Yeah well the sexuality of Marvel movies is interesting to me because there is like male female attraction but it's like it's like it's like there's a decency code. Like it's so weird like all they can do is like like kiss each like just like a quick kiss and mostly like do soy bands with. Yeah it's like a new a new like Hollywood code era. Yeah it's all about keeping this very marketable. Yeah it's very like disconcerting but I I think like it does just reflect like a culture where people are like yeah having kids less I mean like all that's all that like stupid shit in conservative media about like hook up culture and shit I mean people are like have been having less sex for a while. And I think it's attributable entirely to sort of societal breakdown and economic. I mean yeah like I don't think you need to like necessarily like think there's like oh there should always be like a one to one ratio between sex having and child production you know reproduction. But like I mean I think like oh this is part and parcel of just like a general feeling of like a loss of a belief in the future. Like either either of ourselves like our own personal lives but like our country or you know species as a whole. Like I mean and now well now the new big thing on the right is that they're fucking like they're like Tucker Carlson is talking a lot about dropping sperm counts. You know like like this is a big panic now and like for all I know it's probably true because of all the fucking chemicals and like plastics that we put on it. It is true. Yeah it is. Yeah we're on pace for zero sperm count by 2045. But you're totally you're totally right though like you know sex does not equal reproduction but there is something life giving about sex. And so to that end not having sex convey as like a deep-seated pessimism about the future. Yeah I can't get you attached any of the shit you don't know how long it's gonna be around. Right and I mean I was I was saying like yeah child like childbirth and stuff but like even just I was saying even just like. People having sex is down it has been down for a while now and that's like I mean maybe maybe because like yeah just casual sex where like two people meet and think each other a cool or attractive or maybe the woman hates the man and wants to tweet about it later. He's recently bought a couch but she hates him in a way that's sexual test ab sex with him. See his new couch that he bought. This is the only $600 he thought couch is couch is cost $7,000. You thought they cost like $20,000? Yeah the couch cost $180,000 and you pay it. Look at Louise Linton over here. 100 year installments but no yeah that's like it's like a beautiful mutual thing that isn't really like in and of itself monetized or monetizable. Or I mean it just like at its best and people still do this. The few Americans are still having sex have like a beautiful mutual social event. I don't have that anymore. I just think it's like you know it's just like like like everything else it's like we look at these like you know seemingly intractable social problems and we find ways to talk about them and which it is like all the responsibility of. The individual for not being good enough or not doing xyz and like you know though you know hookups sex fucking love intimacy family like these are not all these things are not synonyms for one another. But it is hard to have like I mean it is rare to have like a sort of fulfilling life that you feel good about without some or some combination of those things. And to the extent to which it's those possibilities are being removed from both men and women. It is it is you know at the we're talking about like you know the impoverishment of our like society in our future that is the direct result of. Material conditions that like opportunities and just money and time that's being taken away from us. Maybe it's harder for people to have sex even when they are out in the world and are in situations where people in the past would more typically have casual sex because. Maybe it's just impossible to think beyond oneself now. Right yeah like create imagining the interiority of another person like yeah at enough of a like vividness to even imagine engaging with them. And like relating to them because you can't relate to anybody outside of yourself you can't conceive. I mean yeah that's like I mean why do like guys in high school like why if I could think of like a singular reason they're always a million reasons but like a singular reason why they like have trouble with girls. And I think the singular like the biggest one is probably that they like think girls are a different species who like don't want to have sex and you have to like. A combination of like fool and impress them or something you have to show that you don't care about them. I feel like come up with the right magical combination of words to like trickle with. Yeah no like tricking them yeah and or unlock something in her. Right but like as you get older you're like oh women are horny too women are also like women also like they seek the same sort of validation. Desire. They want to keep feeling that I desire and validation that I that I seek and that's not a bad thing. It's can be but just casual sex can be beautiful in that sense that it's like yeah two people kind of like validating each other's desires and they go their separate ways or whatever but I think everyone is kind of permanently 14 years old now where it's like everyone else in the world is an alien creature. Yeah who couldn't possibly have similar desires or interests. We're also Adam. Anything that they have. Yeah and we've also totally lost any semblance. I know that this is new and like newer and like last year but we like we don't have any public spaces or you know a shared like in the absence of like shared stories or you know a meaningful shared culture outside of like Marvel movies. Like now we don't even have like shared neighborhood bars with with you know in which you could like run into someone that maybe like you'll meet and have a connection with. Yeah it's bad yeah it's like yeah sad times in America yeah I like I remember I sorry I remember like when I was like in studying abroad or two yeah no absolutely no women on this trip get him out of here. Did you study abroad Felix in Spain and there was this kid in my class because it was like an international class that thing. It was actually the CIA. Everyone listening to this is thinking that yeah but no he was from Denmark and I I remember he was talking to like in a man another American guy who is like you know like a nice like kind of nerdy American guy and he was explaining to him how like in Denmark you can go to a bar and just casually meet a woman and if you like each other you'll have sex. Like it's crazy like that's a crazy thing but it like it kind of is for a lot of Americans now like a lot of Americans probably that is very hard for them to imagine. Yeah no and I guess just a wrap things up here you know while not falling into the the trap that is that is verboten in movie mindset the belief that you know movies can make the world a better place or make. Like this nation's politics better in any meaningful sense I do think though I do I just I appreciate though that like it seems that there isn't opening for some common ground on the left and right to both bring back squibs and actual violence in movies not will not actual violence but you know. Let's do it. Yeah it's not films let's do it. Bring back practical effects. We're talking about bodily fluids like practical effects like squibs. We want to see comb shots we want to see squibs. Retuitous nudity and I don't mean this from like a misogynist bro perspective let's get some penises in movies so. Yeah let's do some full of it. Absolutely. We film in penises in movies again. I want to see it in Tom Harding's day. I'm very curious about what it looks like. Women have been coasting off the fumes of that movie where Liam Neeson's flopper is just fucking dangling around. That's like the only thing they got. Oh god I remember a shame. Harvey got telling badly to him. Fast bender is like like like he had he had his dick you could see him like his dick from while he was peeing from behind. So that's how you know he's got. Yeah you can count that you can count that you got that. You can count that you can count that you got that. So it's just a male full frontal nudity. I have Kevin Bacon and Wild Things. Harvey got telling badly to him. And then like every other example is some European movie. But like that's a different genre. Yeah yeah yeah like if you if you want to see like first of all they use a prosthetic dick in anti-cries for Willem Dafoe because it was a prosthetic dick it was a stunt dick it was a real penis from a porn performer who was actually less well endowed than Willem Dafoe. It's apparently yeah no because it was distractingly big. And also like unless you're really fucked up woman woman which you know there are a lot of that's a hard scene to jack off to because he just like gets his dick caved in by a booking log. I'm praying that scene. I don't know some women might like that. I don't know. Don't don't yuck my um. Well you know I'm just saying like that it just we think that the blood of life the blood and the fluid of life um I think should be you know uh filmed more often and not in a pornographic context like in in the context of a movie we want to be excited we want to we want to see life we want to learn life. Life is about sex and death yeah I really I mean like movies are about sex and death like movies are like how we deal with our anxiety about those things or how it's what we want to be excited by is sex and violence. Yeah I mean to sort of like you know really what you said about how movies can't change the world I mean I have the same view of all media like I accept blogs as much as much blogs can but like as much fun as I have like doing the show and as proud of this I as proud of the I am of all the work we've done yeah I don't think it's changed the world really in any way but I do think the best thing you can do is meet either thing that can allow you to go to sleep at night sort of happy with what you're doing with your life is that they give people a reprieve or they give even better people something to look forward to. I think the best and if movies if movies had some type of visceral quality again I don't know it feels like everyone is watching these movies but they're not enjoying them as much as they portray I don't like I think that's the feeling I get leaving like media or journalism and like comedy aside and just speaking specifically about like art and movies in particular like I don't think they can change the world or make it a better place but I think at at their best and I'm talking even not like not just art films I'm talking even just like cheap crafts entertainment like at their best I think that they crack open something in our in our minds they they're just like the movie magic does something where it it it allows us to have a glimpse of like a better like a different way of being a different reality like something different inside ourselves that is maybe there that we can access it maybe just a tiny bit of it it just it it creates a possibility inside of us that wasn't there before and you know like that possibility is you know like what what is this life for like why are we here what what makes it worth living and the answer is sex and death one of those things is coming inevitably the other the former lesson lessso which hasons the latter and certainly not to anyone on this call just kidding fear the fear the old blood okay that is that is the last word on that fear fear the old blood but let's let's let's have some horningness in movies again can we yeah let's just breathe back chopper says get out there and yeah and not knock some boost yeah okay okay guys guys ladies think of the member of the opposite sex picture them in your mind the kind you would like to mash their thing against your warm or vice versa uh go up to them and uh just go uh uh uh uh uh cameras realism mark fishers let's do it let's go let's go let's go COVID's over COVID's fake let's go go out there come on let's go COVID is not over and fake please do not cancel our fucking patreon all right well we'll majestic 12 I would let's close out the show by thanking our our guests and my love Catherine Krieger oh thank you we're talking about love and you know sex so I'm feeling thank you they're gonna you baby oh oh oh oh oh oh yeah why don't you guys go in a tree we just we just might we just might but uh Catherine uh if people would like to more Catherine Krieger what can they do where can they go uh well speaking of sex and death um it's our one year anniversary at discourse blog and if you don't know about discourse like some of the people on this call might not um it's the former crew at splinter independent left this media if you're listening to chapo maybe you already like that maybe you already support us but it's our one year anniversary or one year birthday never thought we would make it this long you know just like lefty analysis and news and cultural commentary uh and we're having a birthday sale it'll be up by the time this episode is live 30% off an annual subscription with the code birthday discourse blog dot com slash subscribe 30% off annual subscription code birthday support some leftist media we would love to have you check it out everybody thank you thank you to Catherine and thank you to discourse blog um go check them out um until next time guys bye bye",

      "text": "Hello everybody, it's Monday, October 21st and we've got some chop-up coming at you. I would like to kick off this show by reminding you about Matt's book and I think some of you may have gotten the wrong idea about this book. This book is an exclusive offer that is literally only available to order for the next 10 days. This is how we match the printing to the orders, but your opportunity to have a copy of Matt Christmas book expires on October 31st. So if you have not done pre-ordered Matt Christmas Civil War, you know, Matt Christmas Spanish Civil War, if you have not done that by now, please do so or you will be stricken from the book of life. Also, inserting this a little later from the edit because I just confirmed we are going to release 250 more signed copies of No Pass Iran, Matt Christmas Spanish Civil War. They will be on sale at chapo-traphouse.store next Tuesday, October 29th, starting at 9am Pacific Time, noon, eastern time. So I know a lot of you have been asking for another opportunity to get a signed copy of the book. That will be the very last opportunity. 9am Pacific Time, noon, eastern time, Tuesday, October 29th, chapo-traphouse.store. The book will be available until October 31st. Get your orders in now because after that there will be no further chances. Okay, back to Will. I would also like to remind you that our live show in LA with E1 on November 4th tickets still on sale and we'll provide the link to that in the show description. And last but not least, I would like to, before we officially start the show, note the passing of a great man, a man that influenced me, a great deal, and certainly was instrumental in the creation of this program, Chapo-traphouse. I am speaking of course about Fatala Ghulan, who passed away today. And I'd just like to say, were it not for the tens of thousands of fake bot accounts and Patreon subscriptions that his movement created for our show to get the word out about his movement? I don't think we would have the success that we have today and I just hope his death won't mean that he's cutting off all those fake subscriptions that fund the show. Yeah, what else can we say except, you know, fuck 2024? Can you believe we still have to go to school even when this shit is happening? If anyone would like to join me in a Tuesday school walk out to memorialize, Mr. Ghulan, you're free to join me. Unless you're in one of Fatala Ghulan's network of schools, you do not want to stay in school. If you're in the Ghulan school, you need to do extra school. Like when you would usually go home, like just, you know, take a sleeping bag. Schools out for summer unless you're in one of Ghulan's school networks, please keep going to school and please keep getting the word about the fraud that is Erdogan, the watermelon seller. Yeah, as always, fuck Erdogan shit. Erdogan fraud. Erdogan fraud. Erdogan shit. The watermelon seller. But like, you know, in light of the death of a legend, I think it's like more crucial than ever to tell people, like, please test your Molly. You know, like this could have been avoided. And that like if we take anything away from this senseless event, I hope it's that. Make sure you have Norkin with you at all times. Yeah. Okay, so to, uh, now we've got the business out of the way. I'd like to officially start the show and introduce our guests for today. Today's episode we will be talking about a, a, a recent phenomenon that I have become fascinated with. It is the phenomenon of Slot. Let's love our, of AI generated content that has colonized a great deal of the internet and is opening up strange new frontiers and human consciousness and perception. And joining us to talk about this phenomenon is Max Reed, who recently wrote a great article for a New York magazine about the rise of AI generated internet Slop. Max, welcome to the show. Thanks for having me. So just to kick things off, I mean, Slop is an umbrella term. But like, what, what are we, what are we talking about when we talk about like the kind of Slop that you're writing about? Like, are there different varieties of Slop and like what encompass, what is encompassed by this term? Yeah, I think the, the best and like quickest way to define it is to call it weird fake AI crap. It really depends on the platform. And so, you know, if you're on Facebook and this is probably the sort of most famous weird one, if you're on Facebook and you scroll for a while and you click around for a while, you're going to start getting served up these absolutely insane images of Jesus made out of the bodies of shrimp, like really muscular policemen holding carons in the, in the surf on a beach, morbidly obese women on mopeds driving through villages in India. I saw one that's like an African woman with a chains around a huge orb of dead babies, dragging it over like a cracked like a cracked ice sheet like over ice flows. This sort of like, there's like a sort of lovecraftian aspect to the Facebook stuff, which has like really grabbed people's attention. But you know, if you're on Twitter, you can see it all over the place in like any reply to any popular tweet. There are now thousands of guys either like restating the premise of the tweet in like very obvious chat GPT language or having weird conversations with each other or often like there are sort of news, news Twitter accounts that are just pulling, you know, links and summarizing them with chat GPT and throwing them up. Spotify, there are fully AI-generated country bands, electronic artists, with AI-generated images, AI-generated biographies, Kindle. If you have a Kindle, you may have seen advertised on your Kindle lock screen, these absolutely disgusting AI-generated books called things like Healthy Children's Quest for Eating or, you know, Norseman's saga, like Viking Revenge story with these like really bizarre AI-generated images. The way AI guys define it, I think, which is a little bit friendly to the AI itself is is unwanted AI-generated content. But you know, I think you just really get at the sort of like lizard brain revolution that most people have to do this stuff. You will never regret liking this AI-generated image of a baby covered in fire ants with an opening assignment that says, today is my birthday. Right, exactly. And most of the one of the most like garring physical aspects of this type of AI slop is I don't know if this is like just because of the the the the stuff that it's fed or like if it's a specific protocol. But when it makes people and specifically like children, they make the eyes so disgustingly huge. I mean, is that like is that a thing where like they they told the machine like, oh, there's you know, it's a dumbass like evo psych thing where like, oh big eyes are cute. Yeah, it's possible. I mean, it's hard to say. Some of this is like, you know, if you've played around with an AI generated with an image generated, then you know that it's going to insert all kinds of weird sort of formal qualities to the image that you didn't intend to because so much of what it's doing is kind of doubling down on cliches. You know, the way these words obviously is they're sort of regressing to the mean and they'll find whatever there's a thousands of Thomas Kincade, millions of Thomas Kincade images online. And so it's just going to keep kind of aggregating those into your image. But a lot of so for this article, I talked to a lot of guys who are trying to make a living making this slop. And they were really consistently explaining to me like, no, no, like I'm not making this weird because I'm weird. I'm making it weird because that's what plays. So there's nothing that would, you know, it would be totally likely to have somebody typing in, like you say, some kind of ed psych based like, oh yeah, larger. Neat knee is extremely important to like getting my Facebook dollars or whatever. Okay, so like I'll want to get into it later in terms of like the economy of the people creating this. But like in addition to like, you know, the seemingly overnight mass proliferation of the slop, triple or as you're describing, it demented nonsense that is on the internet. Aside from providing like a sort of an amusing and bizarre phenomenon, there are not going real world effects of the proliferation of AI generated search results and like an AI generated content. And a couple of them you talk about in the piece is you talk about a website that publishes science fiction stories called Clark's world. Could you talk about what happened to Clark's world when he like in terms of his submission process for a generated content? Yeah, Clark's world is a digital sci-fi fiction magazine. It's like quite sort of important to the sci-fi world. Like it's a it's really well known for publishing first time authors and bringing them like amazing tales or weird, yeah, weird tales are amazing stories. And basically any, if you're at all familiar with sci-fi, any author you know of right now has been published in Clark's world and maybe even got their start there. And I bring all this up because one of the important things about the story is like, they're really it's really important to them to accept any submission from anywhere. They read everything they get because they want to discover unknown authors and they have, you know, they have a commitment to this mission beyond like making money because I don't think it's a hugely money-making enterprise. So in January of last year, which is maybe a month and a half after chat GPT finally debuted to the public, they started getting this flood of submissions that were, I mean like bluntly just terrible and not terrible in the normal way terrible in a way that we now sort of all know is really typical of chat GPT. There would be like weird lists in the middle of them. Neil Clark who runs the magazine told me that all of them basically all of them ended with the scene from the end of Return of the Jedi. Like somehow they would place it in there. So it would always be like, you know, the earth is about to be destroyed. These three scientists are going to save it and then it would do like a bullet pointed list of the fictional scientist characters and then it would do a paragraph that was like and they have come up with the, you know, the nuclear tron annihilator saver and there'll be a paragraph about that and then the final paragraph will be like, and all the planets were like celebrating with fireworks and like Endor was celebrating with fireworks and Coruscant was celebrating with fireworks. And the problem here was not so much that they couldn't tell that this stuff was AI because like it was really obviously it was AI. It's just that they were getting, you know, hundreds of emails an hour that was just this and there wasn't because of their sort of, you know, commitment to reading everything and not just dismissing things from writers they'd never heard of or people from specific countries say they kind of had to read through all this stuff and just check off everyone as being AI. And these submissions got so, you know, the speed at which they were coming in and the scale at which they were coming in over the course of January and February got so immense and Carthold is not a big operation that they had to shut down submissions and basically be like, we're not taking, you know, this is the lifeblood of the magazine, the submissions. So they shut down for, you know, six weeks or something which was a huge, you know, warning sign about what's going to come. They have, you know, to be clear, they've come up with a kind of system that Neil wouldn't talk to me about because he feels like he needs to be really secretive about it because so much of this, I mean, it's very similar, I think, to spam detection systems where you can't say what you're doing because you don't want to give people an edge to get in. But they still are, and I'm sure we'll get into this soon. There's still like a million YouTube videos out there of people encouraging their viewers to submit stuff to Clarksworld that they have written through chat GPT. So this is not even a solved or an ended problem. It's just they've sort of staunched the bleeding for a while and are figuring out what to do next. And like the Clarksworld example struck me as something that was like particularly vile because like, you know, as you describe Clarksworld, like this is, this is a, like, you know, a digital publication that prides itself on taking, as you said, taking submissions from anyone who wrote a story and reading them. And then if they select them, paying them about $12.00 or word, which is, you know, like, you're not making great money doing it, but like, they are paying for writing. And they're paying for original writing and they're giving a platform to people who otherwise not have it. But then like, as you said in the article, there are like YouTube videos from like, slop influencers are like, how to make $2,000 submitting stories to Clarksworld. And it is just like, you know, like, you know, a hampering the ability of this like important literary outlet that is like, you know, a small operation, but nonetheless doing, I think, very interesting and compelling work in the field of fiction. Yeah. And I mean, the other sort of big to me, sort of scary example, as I talked to a bunch of librarians who were seeing a very similar thing where, you know, it depends on the library and what its collection policy is and how it works exactly. But a lot of sort of big systems, you know, a person can walk into the library and request a book or request a book on a specific topic and a librarian will fill out a request form and it goes to your collections librarian who orders it or who receives it, you know, they can even order it directly sometimes and you'll have a librarian who receives it on your desk. And it's not a Clarksworld level flood yet, but if you, there's a lot of librarians who will tell you that they are getting more and more AI-generated bullshit, sort of crossing their desks. I talked to a librarian who first started seeing this because he saw a recipe book that was like a Mediterranean diet recipe book and he like opens it and the first page of the meal plan, the recommended lunch is marinara sauce, which is not, you know, I don't see a problem with that. I mean, I'm the father of an Italian American, I don't want to say anything about, you know, what's going on, but I don't think that's a healthy lunch, frankly, for our children, for our librarians, for anybody. And you know, it's for me, one of the things that is important to think about here is like librarians, this is not like a group of people who are like really well paid and have like a ton of resources in time at their disposal. You know, they're like just doing their best to keep these things in New York, they're doing their best to like keep Eric Adams off their back and keep things open and to have to also be looking at every, you know, sort of collected book that comes in and being like, actually, this is shit, this is AI shit is not a useful, is not a useful way for them to do their jobs. And you know, like there is like marinara sauce is funny, there are like without being too alarmist about it, people are ordering like, you know, living with cancer books and like parenting a child with ADHD books that are just chat GPT generated or 90% chat GPT generated, there's no way that they're getting the advice that they very clearly need from something that a guy in Nigeria has like compiled from his chat GPT answers. I mean, Max, I think the most potentially alarming example of this happening recently with AI generated books is the guide to mushroom foraging, which is like, it is very important if you're putting out a book about which mushrooms are okay to eat that they'd be accurate. Yeah, I would say so. And like the variation between different kinds of mushrooms are sometimes imperceptibly small to the human eye and let alone a computer generated view of this. So it was literally giving people advice on how to poison themselves to death with mushrooms. Yeah, and you know, this is one of those like so much of this is just based on nobody did on like what's being searched for. And you know, so you kind of are literally setting up a system where the kinds of things that people are looking for guides for are almost by definition like really important things. So the kind, you know, there are things that you need to know about that you need to and so mushrooms is like the perfect life for death example, where what are you going to do if you want to go mushroom if you want to go foraging somewhere like probably even I would would just type into Amazon somewhere like mushroom foraging guide. And you know, some of these are really obviously AI really like unsophisticated, but some of it is is like not meaningfully different in its presentation from guides from like actual ecological societies. And I you know, would be very nervous about ending up with a book with a book that is telling me to eat whatever I mean, this is we're out of my knowledge arena here, but well, and much of that's death in the name is usually a bad one. Folks, just stick to eating marinara sauce. Don't pop it over the mushrooms. Marinara sauce will always be safe to consume. That's a lot of vibrancy in it. Yeah, I think, you know, like the issue that this presents for libraries is an interesting one. And you know, look, maybe the New York public library system wouldn't have so much trouble with their budget if they were giving people the books that they really wanted like child hunger quest, the search for snacks volume one, or is this snake okay to grab useful information like that, but you know, prior to the internet, things like libraries were like the physical storehouse for like the some total of the repository of like human knowledge and culture. And like that, the premise of the internet as you write is like, you know, something of, you know, to use it cliche, the information super highway. And like, you know, the internet still is, it's like you said, it's where we go to answer questions to find out about new things, but at the same time like like with libraries, the internet now is being colonized by this essentially fake in like, you know, not fake news, but just sort of like things that aren't real, things that are not a reflection of the like I said, the some total of human knowledge. And you mentioned the idea, the dead internet theory. Like what is that internet theory? And what does this phenomenon describe? Yeah, so dead internet theory is a really classic like skitzo poster, conspiracy theory, you know, folk, you know, folktale, like, I mean, I don't mean to be dismissive, I love it. It's like one of my favorite sort of things to encounter online. But the idea is that most of what you see online is not made by humans, that it's some kind of really sophisticated, you know, ongoing, siaop or, you know, sort of big business, conspiracy is just presenting robot generated people having robot having conversations about robot generated topics, pushing robot generated stuff on you. The internet itself is as the titles are just dead and that you, the person consuming it or maybe the only person left alive on it. And you know, what we're talking about, you can see why this theory is so attractive because it is often how it feels. Like especially Twitter in particular has this problem right now because there's so much, there's like so much bullshit bot spam everywhere across the platform, you know, and because they're promoting blue checks, it's like, you know, if you're if you run a spam network, of course, you're going to get a, all your all your bots are going to have blue checks. And like somebody found a tweet that was very obviously a description of a photograph, it was like a nice couple, it was just text, it's just at a nice couple staring at a sunset and holding hands or something like that. And then hundreds of replies from bots underneath it, complimenting the photograph, which obviously didn't exist, was just this sort of texting. I have no idea exactly how that happened, but that was to me like this signal experience of using Twitter in 2024. I think with like a lot of things, especially like Twitter engagement farming and like the types of videos that were that were like kind of, you know, lowest common denominator and or geared towards children. The internet of like the latter Trump years to early Biden years was sort of like, it was already perfectly positioned to be subsumed by a at least on the lowest tiers. Like the types of things that were being made, just in response to the vectors of monetization on the current internet. Like I don't know if you remember those like really weird Elsa videos. Oh yeah, for sure. Like all over YouTube. Oh yeah, I show my son those all the time. I said, I mean, he's four. He needs to know about surgery. He needs to know about the fucking spider man. That or like, you know, the very grim economy of Twitter even before you were like, I've gotten messages from people who run those like OF girl management accounts where they're like, how much would it cost to get you to reply to me underneath your big weed, which is just so horrible to think about. But yeah, just everything the entire way that the internet has been monetized in the last like four years, especially has set it up perfectly for like, I would say, yeah, the bottom 30% of content to be just done by machines who aren't particularly good at approximating human desires or even like, you know, human posting patterns. Yeah, I mean, I think one thing this article really made me realize, you know, AI since since the first the sort of new generation of generative AI stuff debuted a couple years ago, the tech investors, like the people whose book it is, I've been really talking it up as like the next generation of tech growth and tech wealth, they want it to be seen. I mean, part of this is about sort of replacing crypto as the as the place where investor money can flow. I really wanted to be seeing this the new thing after platforms, but you know, writing this story, it became like, you know, the sort of short version of the story is in the 2010s, like the rise of the platform as a business model, like the software platform as a business model meant huge amounts of money flowing into the pockets of Facebook and its investors of, you know, Google of Amazon, even of Twitter to some extent. And what became really clear reporting the story out is that the AI stuff is not actually a separate thing from these platforms that the way generative AI works is as you're saying, like actually sort of like perfect for them that you have these businesses that are effectively infinite marketplaces for consumption. And now you've got a machine that just infinitely produces content and can fill every single niche that exists on those on those platforms. It like, you know, it couldn't be better, you couldn't have designed a better thing for Facebook if you tried, then just something that makes awful images that can be shared at will forever and ever. Yeah, you know, in the in the dead internet theory, and you bring up the example of interactions on Twitter, and I have the quote for the thing you referenced where it was a photo captures a couple exchanging vows at sunset. The emotions that it votes are love happiness and the memory of a special day filled with promises hundreds of verified accounts swarmed in the replies to praise the missing image. This picture again, no picture was posted. This picture I think zoos pure love enjoy a magical moment indeed. This photo truly encapsulates the beauty and magic of true love such a beautiful moment captured in time filled with love and joy. And there is a distinctly, whether it's a dead internet theory of this idea that like, you may be the only real person left on the planet and everyone else is a bot, but it has a distinctly science fiction quality to it. And you write in the article, the rise of Slop has appropriately the shape of a good science fiction yard, a mysterious wave of noise emerging from nowhere, an alien invasion of semi coherent computers, babbling in human like voices from some vast electronic beyond. And this of course invokes to me that this is very much a Philip K. Dick story. And you know, Philips, I know you're a fan, but Max, I'm wondering, are either of you familiar with the Philip K. Dick story, pay for the printer? Yeah. Okay, when Max when I was reading your article, all I could think about was that story. And for those of you who don't know, it depicts a sort of post apocalyptic human society where it was like hundreds of years after nuclear wars have destroyed much of everything and humans live in these sort of like isolated colonies. But human civilization has evolved to become sort of have a symbiotic relationship with an alien species called the Bill tongues that arrived on Earth to feed off its radiation. And the Bill tongues, what they do is that they can perfectly copy any object that you give them that they absorb it into this like giant like amoeba and they copy like a wristwatch or a car or a piece of clothing. And in the story, human beings have become entirely dependent on the Bill tongues to manufacture all of the things that make human civilization possible. But in the story, the Bill tongues are getting worse at it and they're getting sick. And every object that they copy becomes a shittier and shittier and literally disintegrates after a short amount of time. So in the story, everything is just filled with trash and like buildings, clothes, cars, etc. are just turning to dust as humanity finds itself in a situation where it no longer knows how to produce or manufacture any of the things it used to on its own. And I really couldn't help but think of that story in reading this. It's like what AI has done is kind of a version of the Bill tongue is that it has a useful quality to it. But the more it's used and the more it copies from other copies, the shittier and less useful all of this actually is. Yeah, I mean, you know, related, like first of all, Dick is like all over, I mean, he's all over the present moment. He's been all over the last 20 years like anything that you encounter that's about the fake and the real about decay and about like distance from the real is all so dicky and and also like, I mean, you know, like everyone's like, oh, this is like a cyberpunk shorts, you know, this the world is like a cyberpunk short story. And it's like, well, no, it's really like a 1960 short story by like a completely insane guy from Los Angeles who, you know, who named everything really weird and every other page is like completely unreadable. And that feels much more true. It's not cool. Like, it's not cool. Like a Gibson story. It's just kind of stupid and awful and like really sad ultimately like all those dick, the great diagnosis are tragedies. And I was going to say like part of what the sort of like part of what's happening with this is a condition to talking about it as a kind of perfect technology for platforms is it's just the latest version of something the tech industry, the software industry has been doing now for 30 or 40 years, which is giving you a copy of something you already like and enjoy that's not as good, but is cheaper to produce and is sort of good enough. And because of who we are, because of, you know, how we're interpolated as subjects, because of whatever you want to say, we tend to prefer the cheaper, more convenient, good enough things. And you know, like that's all that's understandable and that's all well and good, except that eventually as as happens in the printer, it's like the original thing that was quite good and like required a lot of time and energy and thought to produce it is no longer available or is as hard to find. And instead what you have is, you know, child's adventure for healthy eating, like the mind readers of sixth grade or whatever it is. And at the very end of pay for the printer, like the story ends with the protagonist, a man he encounters, giving him a single wooden cup that he carved himself, which is like the simplest most basic piece of technology. But he was like, this is the future, like we have to like relearn how to do something as simple as carve a cup out of wood. But you know, going back to like the idea of like, how useful is this? Like obviously, as you said, AI has become a marketing term. And like I think I think it really bearish focusing on that what is referred to as AI is in nowhere near the same galaxy as what science fiction authors are like what we think of as artificial intelligence as it exists in movies and science fiction. It is a universe away from technology that is actually has for intelligence. But it does have a certain utility and I'm wondering are there other examples of things like generative image programs or chat TPPT? Are there examples of things that are like that actually provide a useful function to human civilization? I mean that my genuine answer to this is that like it's extraordinary shit-posting technology. Like it's just really good for like just for just stupid funny jokes. You know, in many ways it does remind me of like early, sometimes using it reminds me of like early days of using new software 10, 15, 20 years ago, where you like the first thing you want to do is figure out how to break it and how to make it do weird things. And it works in ways that are surprising and interesting. And you know, I actually sort of think it's a much more philosophically interesting thing than it is a kind of like profit generating center. Like I don't actually know how you tile it. It's like I don't like the kinds of uses that keep coming up you know from their businesses that are pushing it are like summarizing emails and summarizing PDFs and like answering questions sometimes right and often like completely wrong. And none of those are to me like top level like productivity enhancing whatever's. But the idea of having a computer that you can like sort of talk to and it gives you it like actually does a really good job of imitating Tony soprano's voice or whatever is a very weird and interesting thing. And you know, it like says something interesting I think about language and about consciousness that you can have something that has no reason that cannot itself reason but can so fluently mimic like human speech that you could fool people into thinking it's alive. But like all of these uses are like leisure uses like the uses these are uses that are sort of like you know like it's fun to fuck around on the computer type uses. I would say the one like the one place that it seems like really good and interesting and important is translation. And for years now even before chat GPT when I talked to people who worked at jobs like especially tech jobs where there was a huge international group of people trying to communicate with each other they were all using grant I had never thought about using grammar leave before even though it's advertised before every single YouTube video I've ever watched. But everybody's using it to like make their English sound you know like solid and fluent. And like that that seems like a good old internet type you know like let's all get the big human race getting together and you know chatting in English type thing. But be on that I mean you know there's not quite as many like this is going to solve everything. Yeah I was going to say I have to talk my head exactly per your answer that the positive examples of AI that I can think of of the time I had is the people who took one of our live streams and then made it so that Felix Matt and I were speaking perfect Mandarin Chinese. I'm a true doll that was such a big hit. Michael Lee. And I would say the other example is the Homer Simpson concert videos. Yes I love the song. Homer Simpson's radio head and Google sings popular songs in the 90s as all of Springfield and the Transformers dance for him. And I don't want the whole to see me because I don't think the date I'm the star. I don't think that's just incredible. I thought that was genuinely great. Yeah and the other one I will mention that I'm never going to forget is when the Microsoft Image Generator launched and everyone made different favorite characters behind the wheels of the plane crashing into the Twin Towers. So I'm like shungy from you. I'm getting it. Homey like everybody you'd ever wanted to see you know in the place of Muhammadata doing it. It's just beautiful. Again beautiful. The humanity coming together to like really make something great. Yeah that I mean I definitely agree with you that there are parts of it that are reminiscent of other sort of like late web.co early web 2.0 things. Specifically thinking of when everyone worked together to make it a do Drake in the band of brothers episode why we fight. That was like a huge day for me when I figured out how to do that. Yeah but like the weird thing about it is that like with those things in years prior you the thing exists for like a few months or even a few years and then you figure out it can do these things and you know along the way as you're making it do like these these joke things or these novelty things maybe someone discovers sort of incidental to that that it has this whole other use and it gets used for things that like nobody really initially imagined and it's you know one of the cooler things about emerging technologies like that. With AI it seems like you start out with it being fun and then the more it gets used the less the less your inputs actually matter unless you're doing things like I don't know you know those people who plug uh viral tweets into chat GPT and try to monetize their replies you know very grim things. Yeah I mean part of the problem is it's just not like I think there's a two-part thing like it's just not actually that good at the things you want to be able to use. Yeah I mean I suppose there are programmers you know I hear from programmers who say that it's made them a lot more productive I wouldn't I don't know I'd like math is not my story whatever they do I don't know what it is and I can't I can't help them with that and I also talked to programmers who says it's not it isn't you know increase their productive at all productivity at all but it's I think even if you're if you're like a a dyed in the wool poster you can play around with it and make a lot of 9.11 jokes or whatever but at some point like like you you know how to make 9.11 jokes yourself like you've been doing your whole life man like you you don't need I don't need chat GPT I can just take out Shinji Ikara behind the wheel of the plane driving into the thing and like that's that's that's all you need you don't need it actualize. Get on the plane Shinji you have to it. So there's like so that so you know on the one hand you're sort of like okay this is really funny but like I've sort of run out of uses for it and then on the other hand even though like you know you think to yourself okay maybe I'll plug this PDF into it and it'll give me a summary and I've actually realized that the summaries are not actually that good you know all the things all the sort of those kinds of like productivity saving life hacky little you know like get things getting things done type things they don't really work quite well so what what you're left with is like creating shitty content for platforms like that is that is in fact the like most visible and to me the most obviously profitable like way of using any of these generative I platform. Yeah, we talked about how like AI is a marketing term that's like it's seemingly everywhere now and like every commercial you see on TV they're like oh like it's powered by AI generated insights like oh great thanks I don't know what that is but I remember just a year ago it was crypt out and NFTs and it's it's it's the new concept that like Silicon Valley and the people who own and fund all of it have decided this is the new thing that we all have to like and is everywhere in the most important technology and I think a key part of that is like in the marketing term artificial intelligence that like there's this sleight of hand we're like despite this nonsensical drivel and like demented algorithmically generated images or text it gives the illusion that like this is just machines doing this this is just a computer but ultimately whether it's the video of like you know whether it's a image of like a Korean stewardess carrying Jesus Christ out of an antil or the mushroom foraging textbook that could kill you the slap is ultimately the product of human beings and the decisions that they make and the actions that they take which is at the end of the day about making money through scams and I think there's a connection here to this kind of hustle and grind culture and the dream of passive income but you get into like some of these people who are like making making a living creating AI generated slop like and they're like basically like young kids from like Kenya or India so like how does one actually make money creating this drivel yeah I mean one of the sort of funniest discoveries here so one of the ways this article started is is was trying to get to the bottom of the all the Facebook stuff is just sort of like what is this why is it here it didn't have you know early on when I was like reading you know like looking at these insane images it wasn't clear like what the play was there wasn't like a clear scam often there wasn't like a link they weren't like linking off they weren't selling things there wasn't an advertisement associated with it and I should credit by the way 404 media which is a really good subscription especially if this is the kind of the interest you 404 is like a fantastic tech site that covers this stuff really tightly these are a bunch of people used to be advice and so I was following a lot of their coverage too they were sort of similarly baffled by these things and it's also impossible to get in touch with any of the people who do these pages obviously like why would they talk to some guy and eventually I got some this guy who is who I am like 99% sure is a Kenyan guy named Steve but who insisted to me for a long time that he is an English college an English comp-sized student named Jacob Boyd and Steve you know offered to answer some questions if I sent him some money so I paid him over the course of our conversation he said no he told you no free information oh I like that no free information that's mindset that's mindset so Steve explained to me like right away that actually I was like so what are you doing and how does it make money and I was you know I was sort of gearing myself for some kind of like you know like crazy rubegolberg type scam or they were fattening up the page and we're going to sell it or whatever and he's like oh no Facebook just directly pays me for this and what I hadn't realized because like I'm not on the I'm not on my grind set is that Facebook makes payments to page creators for engaging posts basically not every single one you have to be in the program but it's not that hard to get in the program and there's also like a whole network of people who will fake a you know a an American or a UK tax account for you so that you can get into the program if you're in Kenya which is currently not part of the program but the program is just if you make a post that has a certain number of likes comments shares reactions whatever it is they'll send you a check and so there's this whole as it turns out there's this whole economy sort of lurking behind this stuff of not just the guys that who are making the pages themselves but influencers who are trying to teach you how to make these things so the sort of majority of these are actually I think there's a lot of guys in the like the countries that I think for it's actually kind of funny because I think each platform has a country that kind of dominates like what it does so Facebook to me it's a lot of Kenya Nigeria India Cambodia Twitter is I think like more than half Vietnamese but there's also a lot of Indian like I think it really like there's a there's a big there's a company in Vietnam that does it sells like Twitter bot software basically so I think that's why there's so many Vietnamese botters on Twitter um Kindle is like there's a weird number of Russians or people who I think are Russian and and possibly Israeli too but I'm not it's like harder to figure out who's behind the Kindle stuff and then TikTok like TikTok Slop is mostly American French English and it's especially English born Muslim kids and I don't I don't have no idea why that is I would love to be like an ethnographic study of like why there's so many English Muslim dudes who are on their grind set trying to make money off of TikTok Slop but anyway all these groups have discord have telegrams have YouTube influencers who are selling lesson plans um you know or whatever it is selling access to their top secret discord um that teach you how to make the engaging content to get into the plans the Facebook's got a creators program TikTok has a creators program obviously we all know Twitter has a creators program you know all of these are these ways to just get sent money for making engaging content I mean arguably Spotify even has one it's just a little more encoded because it's just royalties um and Kindle Kindle doesn't but Kindle that's much more obvious how you make money which is you just sell the bullshit that you're making I think it's a perfect that Kenya is a hub for a lot of this Slop driven activity because in your article you mentioned as an example of one of Google's AI AI overview search results is there are no countries in Africa that begin with the letter K so I mean maybe this is just like Kenya's revenge on the algorithm we're like we're here we have K and Arton title of their name of our country but I think the really interesting thing about like you like you said these sort of tutorials and but sort of for pay seminars that teach people how to create this engaging content I think it's fascinating about like as you said like I'm not like the people you interviewed they said like I'm not doing this because I'm weird it's because weird things get attention and you you you talk to Jason Kobler of 404 media and I just want to read here it says watch dozens of Hindi language Slop seminars on YouTube many of them offering example prompts such as American soldier veteran holding cardboard sign that says today's my birthday please like injured battle veteran war American flag and all the American woman is making forest lion out of cauliflower and her neighbors are looking at it keep it detailed and I just want to like one more this is actually from Jason Kobler at 404 media he just talks about like I'm just fascinated by the prompts of the things that get attention and he says he clicks a page called amazing magic and says photos for people are good anything that touches the heart cute babies children there is a lot of good engagement he clicks over to a page of AI generated pets people in the US and foreign countries they love their pets and other animals there are many pet lovers there and that's right he shows them an image of typing things into a being image creator like African boy create a car with recycled bottle forest a African boy create a truck with recycled Coca-Cola bottle forest throughout his videos he's talking about how his phone can barely connect to the internet and that his internet speeds are maxing out at eight kilobytes a second so I guess my question here is that like you know like there's a certain template to these images where it's like yeah the poor child the poor child saying please today is my birthday I have no presence will you give me like or US soldier battle veteran like you know a saving American flag what is it about like this sort of this kind of images that are being generated by people in India and Cambodia and Kenya that they're playing to an American audience what does this say about the American psyche I mean it's a it's a that's a it's a great question I mean it's sort of itself explanatories and it's like this it's like the dream I was I couldn't get this I couldn't get this like articulated right but there is something about it where you combine the kind of the way AI like like gloms onto cliched images and and sort of and like like follows a particular kind of regress autoregressive path as it creates its images along with the like marketplace that is Facebook which is sort of reading supposedly reading the revealed preferences of what people are scrolling through and scrolling on and you get what you get out of it is this kind of like the dream of what the American of what the internet or what the American internet is looking for which is like mutilated soldiers begging for likes you know puppies and kids Jesus just constant Jesus everywhere nonstop a little bit of Quran I mean I think that's probably not a panic I think that's you know other countries or whatever but they're like the other thing I would say though is that it seems clear and I don't have any like hard evidence except for just the experience of of going through this and talking to other people done it that Facebook is pushing AI stuff that there is it's like you'll get if you start clicking on and liking AI generated images you tend to get a lot more afterwards even stuff that's about unrelated subjects or unrelated whatever and so I you know I don't know why they would do that exactly or what what exactly the sort of point is there but it also feels like Facebook is kind of enforcing this like you know this surreal experience of what was the the guy I talked to see though told me that like his biggest subjects were like US military pets Jesus and Manchester United so there's a lot of there's a lot of hooligans out there although you know the other thing about it is like Manchester United I think probably like 90% of actual Manchester United fans are like not even in the UK so it's just a global obsession with you know with the Manchester United brand unfortunately there's like no images of Manchester United players amputated you know begging for likes on the on the beach one of my one of my favorite like recurring image genres I saw from a group like that is like you know obviously anything with soldiers or poor kids like that that the poor kids is like a whole genre on the internet even pre AI like everyone loves the picture of like a poor kid with a toy made out of garbage and caption is like be thankful for what you have yeah but um what I thought was the funniest thing and especially now knowing who's making this was that they kept generating like they kept developing like real life Jesse Pinkmans they kept developing like sort of like trashy mid-dirties guys wearing like um you know they didn't get the official brands right but like trashy white guys wearing Fouboo holding up signs that are like I'm six months sober cannot get a like and it's so funny to me that like people in like Kenya and Bangladesh and all these like far-flung places are like they they got the data and they're like what are like these dumbass trashy Americans like they just they invented a guy who yeah like steals copper wiring he's a military worshipping pet lover who is also an addict and is an amputee probably yeah I mean I mean I just speak to like you know it's our it's our love for uh uh fake humility and compassion and stories of redemption and uplift and then on top of that we love our pets Jesus and and us army soldiers yeah but yeah I mean some of the the the soldier like the military imagery is like particularly you know if you wanted it like because because the you know what AI does is just sort of expands it so you get all those like gooney like um navy seal images of guys with big beards and big biceps like standing with their rifles or whatever and then the AI just like makes the rifle like twice as big and with like a million attachments it makes a sort of cyberpunk and the guys get even more masculine like they already looks like gigachad kind of it's it's a real it's a look it's an interesting thing so I guess like you know uh in thinking about how like AI has been you know taps to be the new trillion dollar bubble that's going to be inflated and you know even if no one likes it or wants it or understands it I guess it's like where where is this going like in terms of the proliferation of this kind of thing is it gonna is there gonna be is the wave gonna break at some point or is this just the future of information and human identity and the sort of digital age I mean I I am not feeling optimistic I would say I think that this is something we're going to be contending with like forever and I think that it's the kind of thing um I mean I hate to adopt the sort of like framing of the tech guys but I do think this is the kind of toothpaste out of the tube thing like this stuff is here we know what it is we know how to use it is a you know generative AI is increasingly a sort of commodity product there's models that you can download and run on your computer it takes a lot of you know energy and effort to to make things at home but that's gonna that's not going to something that's gonna leave and I also don't feel optimistic about our ability to like um shore up our institutions to support local libraries to you know make anything like better in any way and I certainly don't feel like Facebook uh is going to turn away opportunities to make money if this is something that is apparently making the money I do think the last thing is the kind of like cynically is sort of the best hope I have is I think I think the next few years there's going to be um we're going to see uh whether or not the sort of digital ad market is as ever expandable as has been assumed for a long time I think that some of these companies uh Instagram is not growing in the way that it was hoping to Facebook has stopped completely stopped growing in the US and as in fact not is in fact I believe shrinking in the US slightly the Twitter is obviously like a total disaster tiktok is huge but may or may not be gone in the US or owned by Bobby Coddick or something within a year so there's all these like I think we're reaching a kind of um I don't know what the word I'm looking for is like a like uh like a point where we're going to figure out what the future of these platforms actually looks because they've won so thoroughly over everybody else online over every other form of media over journalism over Hollywood over everything and I'm not positive that they're actually going to get the return they're seeking from that like part of the thing and this is this is something we're thinking about with the AI stuff is like we Americans are the we make more money and we spend more money than anyone else and we're more susceptible to advertising and love advertising more than any other people on the planet this is one of those things we're number one and we're great to advertise we love that shit and we want to be advertised to and we want to buy this shit we get advertised to and if they can't make other markets do that then they're going to have a lot of trouble growing in the way they're supposed to grow the problem is like okay so they won like who's going to nobody's going to come around and like you know say well I've got this non AI you know bullshit that I that you can see so I think that I mean look when I keep telling myself I have a I have a subscription newsletter and I keep thinking like okay but this is a great business opportunity for me because I'm going to be the last like the dead internet theory that good for me like profitable for me because I'm the last human here whatever but you know they I think there is some hope that there will be like a kind of backlash but I can't I can't game it out I mean it doesn't feel good I'll say that much just speaking very generally about how these platforms broadly succeeded at all their goals in forming the internet and forming like just the way that everyone receives content and consumes it follows a broad model that we see in all of this type of shit whether it's like Uber or DoorDash or like really any of these companies that popped up in the last 10 to 15 years which is that like on their way up their advantage over their more like traditional competitors is that they are allowed to just like hambridge money or otherwise not make a profit while doing business by dayloom whether that's like DoorDash losing a little bit of money every time it delivery is made but like it's so comparatively cheaper to having a servant who just picks up Niels for you the same thing with Uber or you know just the content spigot represented by Google and Facebook the logic with all these things always was like okay like on the way up every single transaction will lose money and we have these like massive piles of debt but we have these big valuations because like once we achieve total market share then we get to set the price and that's when we become profitable the thing with like web platforms specifically with Google and Facebook and everyone is like you know now we'll set the price for fucking what you know like like okay you have total market share like you said they won but like okay are you going to have to swipe your credit card to like see a video of jelly roll it's not even real jelly roll it's gonna be a jelly roll yeah it's gonna be jelly roll premium for real jelly roll it's gonna be jelly roll but he has two pig legs I just got I just got back from my deployment and I'll leave me alone I'm sober now I was gonna say like in terms of like my my pessimistic attitude about where this going I have like two two recent examples of like one was Elon talking recently at a Trump rally or answering questions that his biggest concern was whether or not we're going to train AI to be woke or truth see that's a big concern for him but I thought that was fascinating because I think he's kind of giving up the game here that AI is not artificial intelligence it is something that is designed to reflect the values and beliefs of the people who fucking created so yeah it is a conscious decision whether it's going to be woke or not woke and the other example I I'm max I assume you saw the comments made by former Google CEO Eric Schmidt the other week yeah we're speaking at some business conference and he said look we all know that like the developments of the world have no shot of reaching their carbon like limiting goals that they've been outlined years ago we'll have no shot at that it's it's fake it's not gonna happen so we should in fact just burn more carbon and use more energy to power even more powerful AI that will quote solve the problem for us and this to me was so frightening because I think similar to things like the economy the market that become described like their gravity or something and not the net result of just human action and decision and I'm terrified about the idea of like AI just becoming the word that we use to essentially outsource our own you know conscience or moral decision making so that the people who create this AI and own it will be like well the AI is simply just decided rationally who should live and die in the coming water wars yeah I mean this is this is the problem of the software industry as long as it's ever existed is the long-term goal has always been to like obviate politics by putting the computer in charge and like you know what's the famous like you know don't let computers make decisions because computers can't assume responsibility and it's just funny that this is where we're still having is 2024 we're having the same kinds of conversations that people are having in 1975 about this stuff and there still has been no sense that actually like politics is a necessary means of like determining resource distribution that there's no there's no like we're not even talking about like the calculation debate or something that might might have a positive endpoint or whatever it's literally like oh no AI will solve climate change or whatever like you know as long as it's not woke it will definitely solve climate change but if it is woke then we're in a lot of trouble I love the idea of like you know it's zero hour it's you know if there's a doomsday clock for you know catastrophic irreversible climate change we're two minutes out and we we go to the machine you know and it's like deep blue it's like uh no it's it's less like deep blue it's more like the computers from evangelical these charming and obelisk estimates to humanity's greatness and combine knowledge and sort of uh you know cleverness and know how we we type it in we're like what do we do what do we do how do we prevent you know the super stores and the extension events and it goes I'm jelly roll uh you can be as that's going to happen I don't know like no every if you've used Google in the past year and like you asked this simple issue like you know how long is fucking leftover chicken good in the refrigerator um they they will spend extra time to first give you an AI response that is always unconditionally not just wrong it takes your very simple question and refraises it to be a new question that it also gets wrong it's so shitty it's insane and I kind of wonder if like that type of AI that is supposed to be the most practical use case and presumably would be solving helping solve climate change with that it seems like it it's collapsing under its own weight of shittiness that is to say like everyone's talked about those like um indian or otherwise subcontinent websites you get when you type in like how to do something with your how to fix something with your air conditioner or like movie show times you get a website that's called like you know itanya movie show times movie film good time happy or like uh chicken ties delicious for the rest of the easy great time kids um that like all the things that are fed into the machine to help like um get results from AI quicker are it you know it's like an animal eating its own brain it's just um making it less and less sensical because you can't think it can't like see these results and go oh this is bullshit it just goes oh these are the right permutations of words and so the more and more of that it gets the fewer like direct problems much less like incredibly complex ones it can solve i mean one of the things that really frustrates me about this is like to me i mean i can still feel sometimes like optimistic about the internet to me like a beautiful thing about the internet is like is in fact the interplay of sincerity and irony like across the whole thing everything you do and old google like the example that everyone was giving when they were when they were distributing the when they were talking when they when they were introducing this new google AI answers product was the one where it was like how to get your cheese to stick to pizza and the google answer was oh just put some glue in your tomato sauce and that'll go and then he's that how it was like wrong but it wasn't like a hallucination it had a source it was some guys joke comment on reddit and i'm not gonna it's not a very funny joke i'm not gonna defend it but in old google you open up you search for how to get the cheese to stick on pizza and you like a thinking human being with like a relatively sophisticated ability to discern like intent and tone are easily able to see like what are real answers to this question and what are the ironic answers to this question what are the jokes what are the different what like what's a movie quote what's real like what's you know what's part of a list and what's not and google likes to protect like assumes that you have it has so much contempt for you as a company it assumes that not only can you not do that you don't want to do that so instead it's just gonna serve up whatever fucking answer but the irony is that the fucking computer can't do it either in fact it does it way worse than you so you end up in this position where you're like i can't even i'm not even being allowed to use my my like my like higher ape thinking skills to determine how to keep cheese on pizza like i'm just being told to put fucking glue in the tomato sauce i mean i like i totally agree it's it's it's it's infuriating and it feels like it's sort of ruining everything that might once have caught good might once have come out of the internet i'll take it one step further than philix's vision of the future where we ask ai to say if you may be in its responses jelly roll saying i'm not normal in perfect cantonies i would say the more frightening the more frightening thought that i have when i think about this is that like the people will create this immaculate purely rational godhead computer and they'll be like oh ai how do we ensure that human civilization is prosperous and survive for another thousand years and the ais response will be to reduce the human population to a manageable 20 or 30 million people who are connected to the tech industry or are useful to them that's that that's what i imagine a i is going for in the future but look it doesn't have to be this way a i in the future or really right now could generate videos of monols talking to each other with philix and i's voice coming out of their mouths and that is what we should be using this technology for and i'll reiterate if there are any tech companies or ai people out there who can create videos of monols doing an entire episode of chopper trap house that is what i think me and the rest of the human race would like to see that's easily worth two degrees of warming too i mean i think yeah just shoveling the last seven rhinos into a coal furnace to produce not even question you don't even have that yeah all right i got to leave i got to leave it there for today but i want to think max read for joining us today and max if people want to check out your newsletter where should they go max read dot sub stack dot com the newsletter is called read max it's a very clever pun on my name leave it there for today and now for everyone who has finally listened to this episode i can say with utmost confidence you will not have regretted listening to this episode it's my birthday please help me we're gonna leave it there for today thanks again to max

      "text": "Hello everybody it's time for Cousin Prado! Cousin Prado and Morgan in the mornings! Rock at the block, live, live, live, live! In the morning, Morgan, in the morning! Hit me, wake your ass up, and stop! Get friendin' in the morning! Cousin, Cousin, Cousin! Hello everybody, it is Black Friday! Black Friday! Cheese Black Friday, the blackest of days, the heart of darkness. Mm-hmm, and much like the heart of darkness, a book I'm sure Crendor has never had. We are going down! What the book? Jesus Christ! I didn't know that. It is a very important book. It's a book that inspired many movies and video games and TV shows and other media. Why would I argue with it then? I mean, I assume that's because the only place you go to is IKEA and not a book court. I got a book store as I was stolen by the books. They have good coffee there! They do! And I just like to look at the books and then put them back. Well, this is Cousin Crendor in the morning and today's Black Friday. It's the very special day of the year when everyone goes out and about. And this episode's for you! Stuck in the car today, doing whatever it is you do. Hopefully not suffering. Maybe some of you are back. I don't know when this video, video, G's. Maybe you're watching it. That's the case. You shouldn't be watching it and driving. But, uh, whatever it is. I mean, they can't really watch it. Look, I mean, listen to it. You know what? You know what? Johnny IKEA, shut up. You know, you don't get to judge me. You don't get to judge me in my mistakes. This audio that you're listening to as you're driving around. Yeah. Wait, this is for you. This is for you today. This is for you today. Hopefully you're recovering from your Uncle Bob's Rants. Um, you know, little Luminati and your... And a Uncle Bob. I'm completely complaining about Obama. I told you he was a secret Muslim. Yes, Uncle Bob. He's a secret Mayan Muslim robot. Yes, Uncle Bob. Where are my glasses? I left them in Turkey, I did. Yes, Uncle Bob. So, luckily, uh, you got to leave Uncle Bob early to go find some deals. Or you had to go work at the places with the deals. That would be bad. I was already starting to see texts from people and, uh, tweets and things that were like, Oh, dude, you should see the lines. It's crazy. I don't want to see the lines. I know it's crazy. I'm very much aware of it. Here's the thing. I kind of want to see the madness. Because I like that. I like crazy people. I enjoy crazies. But at the same time, I don't want to be involved in it. Like, I have trouble going to a grocery store on Sunday, because it's packed and filled with idiots. Well, that's pretty clear. Grocery stores on Sundays are usually parents with overactive children and the elderly all crammed into one space and it's just like, Oh, my God. I can't. I know. I go to a grocery store like when it's about to close. There's like nobody there. Yeah, I don't. Monday at about 9.30 pm is prime grocery stores. Yeah. That is about the one guy who's like, I need alcohol. And there's another person who's just like, my night, night shopping done. And then there's some people who work the night shift and like one mother and you. It's great. It's great. You get everything you need done. You can stand there and look at prices. Yeah. You don't feel like here's the problem. This is how you know you're a better person than other people. Mm-hmm. This is how you know. When I go to the grocery store, if I see say two products side by side that are very similar. And I want to choose one of them. I will sit there and I will decide between the two like, you know, normal person would. These are interesting. But if there are people there, if it's packed, I will just make a quick choice because I don't want to be in anyone's way. Right? I will look at it really quickly judge and just grab whatever I think is the best choice and move on. Because I am considerate of other people. On Sundays at the grocery store, those assholes are like, hold on. Let me spend 25 minutes holding up the aisle. As my body takes up one half of the aisle and the cart takes up the aisle or the other half. And you want to get through? Half shit. You want to get the whole jimbo? Do you want grade beans? Or do you want salted grade beans? More would keep their both salted. No. Don't give it that sass. That's what it's like. And then you just block the aisle. That's entirely accurate. That's the problem. And then you just block the aisle. And then sometimes it's triple blocked. Like because there's one hold up. And then here's what you have to do. So there's like four people holding up the line in this one aisle. And because you're waiting in your patient person, you sit there and pretend to look at things that are on the shelves. Yeah. You're like, oh yes, yes, those are things. Yep, I'm being patient. I definitely asked you if you can move, but you said one minute. So now I'm just being very patient. As you take now two minutes to decide on corn flakes. There's only corn flakes. The fake brand and the real brand are still corn flakes. You can't mess up corn flakes. Pick whatever is the cheapest to move on lady. If you like the expensive corn flakes, get the expense. Don't waste my time. You're killing me. It's difficult because the expensive corn flakes are expensive. And the non-expensive ones give my stomach not the good feelings. Who is this person that's in line? I don't know. Like an old Romanian woman. I can't use my stomach the feelings. My stomach gets the feelings. Oh my goodness. Yeah, that's, I mean, I don't know what that is to do with Black Friday. But I don't think it's any. I assume it has to do with the fact that we're nice people so we don't go out on Black Friday. Yeah. But I want to go out on Black Friday because I enjoy the insanity of it all. I think it is just about the craziest thing ever. A lot of stuff that's just nuts happens. And I mean, if you go to the internet, you can see just tons of video footage of people getting stampeded and hooked over. And it's all over stuff that just, it doesn't make any sense. No, we're full. Before we start this podcast, I looked up things that were like the deals of Black Friday. And they're all things that if you went online, you could literally get the exact same thing online. Yeah. So why are you pushing people over? I don't understand it. I assume it's because maybe some people don't have credit cards or, you know, I guess there's like, I don't know. I don't know. I don't like buying online. It's dangerous. It's dangerous to go out on Black Friday. Yeah. And they're like, you can get 30, 40, 65% off a purse. Like, do you need that purse? Can I know that? I'll say it once. I'll say it again. I am completely off of gift giving. Yeah. I feel like I should just let people know in my life. You're not getting a gift. You're going to get my thanks, my love. But I don't want to get from you either. I don't want anything. I don't. It takes away the spirit of the holiday. Thanksgiving is about being thankful for people, right? And then immediately the day after, it's about, you know, for 20-some-30-some days, it's about Christmas. It's about the-this happy joyous time. It doesn't matter what you believe, it's the holiday season. And it's about being kind and generous and wonderful to people. And I think the idea of gift giving started out well. And it was very nice. And everyone was like, I'm going to give you a gift. And like, I'll give you a gift. And oh, we're so in love. It's like that stupidest story. Like, I cut all my hair so I can give you a comb. Like, I cut all my hair so I can give you a comb. Like that. Right? It's that kind of nonsense. That's what it should be. But instead it's like, well, I have to buy them something because they're going to buy me something this year. And if they're, oh, man, what if they give me something expensive? I've got to get them something expensive too. And now everyone's in freaking debt. Now they're all in debt. That's how it works. You just don't- I- I- I- I- I- Crendor? I think I told you this last time we were here. I might be coming a Buddhist. I don't- I don't- I think it's just happening to me. I think I'm being taken over by the Buddhist spirit. Is that a thing that can happen? The Buddhist spirit? Because I'm like, you know, like, possessions, man. I'm just getting rid of everything. I'm just- everything about me must go. I'm just giving stuff away. I'm like, I don't- I don't need it, man. You're changing. You're changing as a person for the better of the Buddhist life. Oh, man. Connecting with Buddha. Maybe it's because I'm trying to reach that audience. I hear there are a lot of Buddhists in the world. If I can get all them to watch my videos, we'll be good. We'll be real good. Yeah. Watch me, Buddhists. So Black Friday. You Black Friday. I don't know how he got there. I don't know. We're going anywhere. I don't mean that. Like, you- I still remember that other year. It was like last year. Some lady was a target and she's all, do you have the movie White Chicks? I was like, why would you- why would you buy that movie? My grandson loves White Chicks. He tells me all the time. But- Oh, man, I don't think that he says he likes to watch White Chicks all day. Grandma, I didn't- I didn't mean the movie. He says sometimes he likes to watch White Chicks in his boxers. Oh, man, I don't- Every day from this window. It's weird. Why would you put the TV in the window? My grandson, he's a strange one. So where do I buy that movie? Kids days back in my day. I wish we had window TVs. We didn't even have food. Oh, boys, what do you boys though? Yeah, that happened. But speaking of movies and stuff, this is the craziest thing on this list that's on the internet. It tells you things not to buy. On Black Friday, right? Yeah. And the number one thing is movies. Yeah. It says, don't buy movies- Here's the crazy part. Let me read you this list. And you'll be like, you know exactly what you'll be like. All right. Things not to buy on Black Friday. One, movies. Don't buy movies. They're always overpriced or useless commodity things. Like that's pretty much what it's saying, right? Two, toys. People think it might be the best time to buy toys, but it's not. They're hard to find and everyone fights over them. Three, video game consoles without a bundled item. Why buy just the console if you're not going to get the game? Games are scarce. Don't do it. The discounts aren't there. Like it gives you at least the reasons, right? Yeah. Next, brand name TVs. All right. DSLR cameras. Why not a camera? I don't know. I don't know. I thought it gave reasons. Just, oh, well, the cameras have said there's no cameras. I don't know. I don't know. Oh, well, the cameras have said there's no shortage of cameras around right now. But premium current generation cameras are about to be replaced. So why buy them on the cheap when you can just get the new ones in February? Oh. But again, again, let me just, just, just, let's keep going. All right. Next on the list, winter apparel. Yep. What if you want some winter apparel? Next, hold on. Next on the list, Christmas decorations. Next on the list, exercise equipment. Next on the list, jewelry or watches. Next on the list, any Apple iPad products. Whoa. Next on the list, any Kindle products. Next on the list, any Amazon Fire products. Next on the list, bedding or blankets. Next, wine or specialty foods. And after that, international airfare. It's pretty much everything. Yeah. So I'm glad you noticed that. What are you supposed to buy on Black Friday? The article should have been called just don't buy anything on Black Friday. It's cheaper the rest of the year. Yeah. Like, what? Like, don't buy a camera cheap because the new ones are going to come out. Yeah. But the new ones are going to cost a bunch of money. Yeah. The new ones are going to cost the fortune. Why not get the like, the title is so stupid. And that's making sense. Yeah. It's like movies are dumb. You're not going to watch a little movie all the time. It's like, yeah, but that's like any time you buy a movie. And now you get it cheap. I don't look. I don't understand it. I don't get it. Look at this. And Amazon, you can buy Rio X-Men first class, $1.96 each. And $1.96? Yeah. That's a pretty good deal. I know. I watched movies. I know. I almost bought it. I was like $1.96 for that movie. And I was like, you know what? I don't really need it. I've mentioned this before. And I'll say it again. I currently own four movies. Yeah. Shushik Redemption, The Rock. Yeah. And Die Hard. Yeah. Those are the ones I own that I bought. Lowering. Those are the ones I watch all the time. And then the movie, the F.P. was sent to me. The F.P. Yes. It's about a post-apocalyptic dance competition. To GDR. It's pretty cool. And you have Lord of the Rings too. I thought you did. I have, no, actually, I changed that. I have, I have Lord, I also was sent a, um, the complete Blu-ray of, uh, uh, oh goodness, lost. And, and the old school DVDs of Lord of the Rings. And then old school Star Wars DVDs. But those were all sent to me. So, the ones I've ever purchased. Yeah. Were those three that I need to speak of? Like, I just don't buy movies unless I know that I'll, like, I, if the, if the, not the power, but the internet goes out. I can survive on watching The Rock, Shushik Redemption, and Die Hard, Over and Over and Over and Over again. That's all I need in my life. I spent first class as good, but it's no Die Hard. That's been clear. It's no Die Hard. Yeah. I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I are not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I come in and because they kept opening the stores earlier and earlier and earlier and earlier, right? It was 4 a.m. we thought that was ridiculous. Then it became opens at midnight. Yeah. People thought that was ridiculous. Now that just we open Thursday. Yeah, we open at 6 p.m. Yeah, it's nuts and so Walmart, some Walmarts were open all day. Shh. And my question then becomes why discount? Why not just make it another day? Why have Black Friday? What's the point? Yeah. It's really it. Black Friday was an event, right? It was woke up early and he went crazy and had fun. This is silly. This is silly. Yeah, and it gets rid of the mobs and stuff. Yep. Oh, I suppose to watch the crazy happen. Crazy, that's the problem. The crazy might have already happened. Yeah. Well, I found an article thing that says the Black Friday guide for road warriors. Uh-huh. Which is this to help us get through the day. It says, yeah, it says before you leave home, take another look at inserts. You probably have spent some time scanning the pre-released adscans online. Check the Thanksgiving day inserts in the AJC for updates. I'm sorry. What? The AJC. What are you reading? What is the shopping blog? What is? What? Good find, buddy. Good find. You're one on the internet and found it the most insane thing. It says, oh, the website's called AJC. That makes more sense. It says, take notes so that you can take notes and make a note of items on your shopping list that also require coupons, rebates, or include a gift card with purchase. Make a map so you know where you're going to be going. If you decide on your payment methods, arrive early. Know the store layout. Stay focused. Know the store layout and stay focused. It sounds like you're getting ready to play a sports game. All this can be avoided if you just use the internet. Yep. Really? That's all you should be doing is just using the internet. And put safety first if you see a fight in Walmart, walk the other way. Why is that a thing? Why is that, like, if you see a fault, a fault? If you see a fault with Walmart, I'll walk the other way. If you see a fight in Walmart, what? What else are you going to do? Go closer. Let me investigate this type. You might be like, but I really want the thing they're fighting over. No, don't be an idiot. Yeah, I guess it makes sense. It's not the problem that is, is why specifically Walmart? Fight in Walmart. Walmart, the place where it's happened. But is there ever a fight in American Eagle? I'm a way, man. Try to get my clothes. I'm going to get mine. I'm trying to get my latte from where I left it. You're like, oh my god. I'm like, on your mind. American Eagle sells latte. They do, if you do where to check. Oh, shit. Is that the section of the store that's like reserved for the, just the super sexy people? Yeah, it's got like a bounce versus like a, you're not allowed in. Oh, yeah, we're not nearly as sexy. It's got me as sexy people only. I mean, granddad. It's got me as a monkey's ass. It's for sexy people. And my shirts are American Eagle. I don't doubt that. So I like their things. They're soft. Yeah, there's nothing that somebody'd be fighting over that I would care enough to go and like try and get it from them. I don't know that I care enough about anything that, yeah. Like I guess it's, if you have, if you have people you need to buy stuff for, but because I've given up buying things, I just don't care anymore. I looked at all the deals and I was like, man, yeah. I just don't care. I just don't care. I think I've evolved as a human being. I'm like data on Star Trek. Shhh. Like maybe if they had computer parts like 80% off. I'd be like, all right, I really need this like new graphics card for super cheap. But even then I'd be like, do I need it? See, that's where I'm at, Crandor. I think I've got problems. Good problems though, but I think I'm just done. Yeah, you got some good problems. I'm like, do you need it? I just ask myself, do I need it? Right. Like every time I'll see a T-shirt and I'll be like, that's an awesome shirt and then I'll be like, do I need it? I think I'm ruining the spirit of Black Friday. You are. I'm like the Ebenezer Scrooge. I need ghosts to visit me and tell me that Black Friday will be okay. I mean, two years ago, this is when we started this podcast. I wanna know, are you the same as you were back then? Like when you talk? I still enjoy watching crazy people. Yeah, but didn't you go somewhere back then? Didn't you go out and camp somewhere? No, oh God, no. I could've sworn you did with Davis and that. It was before in Black Friday, no, that was for the PlayStation. Oh, that's what that was. Yeah, and it was totally worth it. I definitely, you know, really have used that since I got it. Yeah. I think I've turned my PlayStation 4 on maybe six times ever. I have used mind more as a Blu-ray player than an actual game thing. Yeah, I don't. It was a total waste of money. And I have never, I have never, I think that might be the start of when I was like, well, I just spent money on junk I'll never use. Yeah, like I bought the Wii U and I was like, well, this is dumb and now I've played my Wii U more than like the other two systems. Yeah, and the Wii U is how many years old comparatively? It's like an extra year old. Like, it's not even that much. There you go. There you go. I don't know. Black Friday, now I'm a bummer, now I'm a, I've ruined your Black Friday marimen. Yeah, I mean, we'll bring it back. So I found some stories. Oh, good. Oh, good. Well, then I think it's time to go to chop the cops. Go up and chop the cops. Oh, good. Chop the cops. With the friend or house, I'd traffic out there. Chop, chop, chop, chop, today. We're flying over Black Friday. Down there, man, it is backed up the, uh, backed up the wazoo. We got people at Target. We got people in Walmart. There's fist fights breaking out. There's like this breaking out. There's a walrus that just broke out of the zoo to get some of these crazy deals. But there is a Buddhist down there, and that Buddhist monk is trying to encourage people to think with their mind and not with their emotions or whatever. And it appears that Justin Everton does not care. He is rushing in to get a big screen TV, and he is good. I got it. He's got that TV, and this guy ripped out of his hands by another guy back to you. Thanks, Crendor. Oh, that sounds awful. That TV deserved it was his. Yeah, it was his. He lost it. It's just like football. You got to pull it in. Can't fumble. Can't fumble that TV. Yeah, TV fumble. Bad play, bad play. Bad play. Speaking of football, we'll get to that in a minute. Cause I've got a shower for weather. Crendor has a weather out there. I's got over at the weather desk. I've been doing pretty good over here at the weather desk myself. I'd never leave the weather desk. That's kind of weird. That is a little weird. Especially on days where you don't do anything. This is very dark, and nobody turns the lights on. Mm-hmm. What am I talking about? Oh, yeah. What's the weather? Slee, stupid dude. I don't even know where to go today. Let's go to Bass, Arizona. You try to type in black Friday, but you typed in B8. I don't even know what I think of typing in black Friday. Now there's nothing. What about black? Black. What about black F? There's black, black flag, black flat, Fort Black, Black Forest. Black Forest. Oh, that's good. Black Forest, Colorado. It's gonna be someone in Bass, Arizona. It's like, oh man, they were going to fight with her. Top shit, Arizona. Too bad. Black Forest, Colorado. It's 41 degrees Fahrenheit right now, and it feels like 36 degrees Fahrenheit. We got 59 degrees on this black Friday for your weather shop, and it's not too bad. You can wait outside, and that's just gonna get older, 56, 49, 31. Back up to 52, but that's 47, 47. Not so much rain, just kind of some moderately mild, you know, medicinal temperatures. That's because in Colorado, is that the joke, or did you just... Oh, no, I just made up stuff. Yeah, okay, great. So can I just point out the way you said, black, black forest. You're like, black forest. I imagine everyone says that? Yeah, it's probably a very nice town. It's called black forest. Everyone's just like, it's pure evil. They're just very nice people there. They're like, oh, welcome to black forest. Oh, black forest here. We make, we make artisan cheeses. Artesian. Oh, yes, of course, artesian cheeses. Artesian cheeses. Artisan. Artisan. We call it artisan. They probably are like having a festive Thanksgiving, and Christmas, they're gonna go sing it the choir. But even they say it like, black. Oh, hello there, welcome to black forest. It's so nice of it to come here. I mean, it's black forest. And what's going on the sports world? Sports, we had some football yesterday. We had the bears. They played the Detroit Lions and Detroit. Five people showed up. And the Lions won. They beat the bears 34 to 17. What? Wasn't there a talk of like a bears come back? What happened? Yeah, they won two in a row, and then they... Oh, no, did you listen to the meatballs? What did the meatballs say? I don't know, listen to the meatballs today, but... Hold on, let me just... Bears news. I'll tell you, there's no defense for the bears inept offense. Just picture this in a bear voice. Detroit, get away from playing last place teams. Get back to reality on his bear season. A modest two game winning streak against the down and outbuckeneers and scoffling Vikings was extinguished in the second quarter, Thursday. And the Lions bombed the defense for 31 points, erasing the bears rarely seen quick start. Well, sort of quick start. One of the team goes 96 minutes, 40 seconds of game action between first quarter scores. It's hard to be picky. No. No. No. I feel bad for the entire city, Chicago. Nope. This is a very sad day for the bears, you know, Jake Oltler. Not doing his greatest. Oh, well. But the Philadelphia Eagles beat the Dallas Cowboys. Yeah. And I don't know how that happens. The Philadelphia is not that great. I don't care how it happens. Dallas Cowboys fan. Don't care about the Cowboys. I don't like either of them. And Seattle beat San Francisco. So that was probably a fun game. Because you know, all the Seattle San Francisco people, they're just, you know, they're very close to each other. So they can just go and, ooh, my team's going to beat you. Every time I'm in Seattle, everyone has a Seahawks. Every time I'm in San Francisco, everyone has a 49ers thing on. Yeah. So you know the two of them are just like, ooh, our team are playing each other. They're probably all together for the holidays. All I'm saying is Seattle and San Francisco fans are unbearable. That's what I'm saying. Well, they're both kind of doing. They're unbearable ass. Both kind of me, San Francisco scored three points. They lost 19 to three at home. It was really bad. They're also not even in the playoffs if it were to start today. Good. Then I don't have to listen to all my friends be like, San Francisco's so great. You know what? No one cares. But people from San Francisco. It is great. Sunday Packers take on New England. Battle of the best teams right there. It's gonna be a test. That is, here's the problem. I, it's New England. I hope New England loses horse. I have me, it's in the Lambo field. Can I just say as I don't know how it became this way, but I hate almost every professional football team. Yeah. Yeah. I just do not like them. Or do you professional sports in general? No, I like pro sports. I think there's a lot of great pro sports. I think that most of the sports teams that were awful. Yeah. And it's my job as a fan to call them out on sucking. I like my meatball brethren to the north. Meatball. Meatball. Continue. Continue to call out professional athletes who get paid to run the foosball up and down the field on their awfulness. They do the same with like every sport. It just like shifts. It's just the same commentary for every sport. Like Derek Rose, he keeps getting into it like, Derek Rose, back when he used to actually play the basketball and his body worked. Oh, he was a pretty good basketball player. But now, probably the worst player I ever seen in my life was his guy, right of him. This is worthless, really. I can just put in some snow and make them useful. Put in Dicock. Put in Dicock. You can score a couple baskets. He wouldn't get hurt. I can't imagine my Dicock playing basketball. I could. Oh my god. That'd be amazing. That'd be amazing. I'd watch that. Oh, all right. Well, that's sports. I guess it's time for a big story of the day. What's our big story? What's our big Black Friday's story? All right. It is. There's two of them. One's a Florida man story. And one is 17 weird things not to buy on Black Friday or ever. What about the Florida man story because it's Florida man? Yes. The popularity. Well, why did you even have to question that? You're like, oh, thank god. He chose that one. Oh, no, I like giving the options. Well, I was reading off some of these other ones just really quickly. Damn it. But body vibration machine, a boob harness, a breakfast for two machine, wide leg velvet paints, a cosmic stick, a fringed crop top, $9,000 playhouse, a denim jumpsuit, Metallica monopoly, loopy jumper, an automatic butter cutter, leggings with knee mesh detail, unit-orin meat, two-tone shirling jacket, baby Jacuzzi, an unwrap me body bow. Those are that. That is, that is pretty great. Half those things I think you can get those crates you can get on the internet. I'm pretty sure. I'm pretty sure some of those, some of those are in crates you get on the internet. So here we go. Florida man gets online to conquer thanks giving sales the old way. The popularity of online shopping stores spreading out their seasonal sales and even forecast rain have all failed to dampen the enthusiasm of a Florida shopper who is attempting a two week amp out in order to land himself a bargain. See, all the things we talked about, this isn't, this isn't phasing a Derek Day Armand. I know he's got a great name, Derek Dayamon. Oh, it's probably Derek Dayamon. Oh yeah. On November 11th, Derek Dayamon 55 pitched a 55. Yep. What are you doing with your life? He pitched a three room tent with air conditioning and TV outside the door of a Best Buy electronic store. I hope that's all in your window. I hope it's all in your window. He pitched a tent. Oh, big. He had air conditioning and TV. He plans to be the first through the doors when they open for the traditional Thanksgiving sale on Thanksgiving Day itself. Then he plans to give his main purchase to charity. Dayamon has been going to work every day at the local newspaper where he is a press operator. While he does so, a team of friends hold his canvas covered space in line. To pass the time when online, Dayamon plays dominoes with friends and serves them from a teaky bar. He has set up inside his spacious tent. That is amazing. He only goes home to take a shower and use the bathroom. We barbecue every night. We invite people in. We've made new friends. He told the New York Times. Dayamon's target is a door buster's deal, a 42-inch flat screen television, which will be priced at $199 instead of $800. For the first few shoppers through the door when the Best by Sales Begins, advanced queuing for Black Friday. The day pre-Christmas sale is traditionally beginning in the US. The day after Thanksgiving is not unusual, but has become less common in recent years. Thanks to the boom and online shopping and stores spreading their sales. Everything we talk about. Many shoppers also dislike the modern phenomenon of stores opening on Thanksgiving itself. Dayamon has solved that one too. His family intends to join him in the tent for the traditional meal on Thanksgiving. Before Best by Opens at 5pm and he can wait in to buy the television, he intends to donate it to a school. He also has his eye on an iPad that will be selling for $100 off-list price. OK. Uh-huh. I love this guy. Yeah. I think it's pretty cool that he's giving away to charity. My question is, why? I don't want to see get out of all of this. Like he's doing this for so long and is camping and then he's donating it to what does he get out of it? That's all I'm asking. What does he get out of it? Yeah, what's he get? I don't even have something fishy going on. Something super fishy. Super fishy. We need to dig deep. We need to dig deep into this one. What does he get it like? OK, what charity is he giving it to? He's trying to draw attention to the charity. And if he's trying to draw attention to the charity, what charity is it? More important. Like it's cool. It's like the childhood KKK center. You never know it could be. But what if he's doing it for a school he used to go to or something? And he's like giving back to the school. What's his motive? That's what I'm saying. What's his motive? Wait, because that's a long time. That's a long time. Oh my god, I found pictures of them. OK. Yeah, see, there we go. I'm going to link you to the article. A lot of times. And there's a slideshow. You can see all his pictures of his tent and everything. LAUGHTER Why does he have a giant rock star energy drink thing? I don't know. Maybe he got sponsored by them. All right, all right. Come on. This guy... LAUGHTER I think I figured out why he's doing it. Yeah, I think. He appears to be the kind of guy who just... does this stuff because he doesn't want to be old. Yeah. Like, if you look at him, he's got a rock star energy drink thing. He's got a Hooters t-shirt on. Yep. He's sitting there peeling more bags of oranges. Talking to dudes. There's a guy. I don't even know what's going on. Yeah, he's... It's like, he just wants the attention, too. He's just the other one to get old. And he loves the attention. And he loves just... He's just like, just tailgating like a football game, man. Yeah. I mean, here's the crazy thing. I think I've seen stuff like that this... Like, I can't even talk right now. Like this at the best bite down the street for me. Yeah. I guess all intent. So, so people are... I mean, this is insane. Like, people understand this is insane, right? It is insane. Like, all he wants to do is he wants to get a... He says, after the one TV, he also intends to buy an iPad Air 2 for $309 bucks. Mind you, the $399 iPad Air is a 16 gigabyte one. So, it's the cheapest one. What iPad, eventually, I mean, why buy an iPad Air if you're gonna get no space on it? That makes no sense. And then a 50 inch Panasonic TV for $199. Yeah. The iPads get for his sons and he plans to donate the television to a children's hospital for a fundraising raffle. Oh God, I like it me even more now. Oh, but I hate him for doing this. I like him, but I hate him. He said his two sons will be sitting down for the traditional turkey dinner inside the tent. One son will be home from military and Afghanistan. The other is a high school student and is embarrassed and doesn't want any part of this, but we'll be here for dinner. Where's the question? Where's mom? How about the cracket open, Crendo? Yeah, where's mom? Cracket open. He and his wife got a divorce. Yep. And he wants to be the cool dad. That's what it is. That's what it is. He wants to be the cool dad. The mom's the one who's like, honey, you have to do your homework and this is the guy who's like, come cheer with me and I'll make you some brews with my hooter shirt, my awesome rock star. This is, that's it? We solved it. We solved it. It's pretty easy to be honest. That was easy. All of them was taking some research and we figured it out. Yeah. Crendo, we're very good at this. We are very good. This is why we make the cool dad. He's the cool dad. He's like, hey man, I bought you this iPad. Oh my God, we could have made a show called the cool dad. The amazing. It's just this guy who's like really sad. I just want my son to love me. I have to wear this awful hooter shirt. It could be a sitcom. The cool dad, come and see me as this fall. That's hope it never does. Anyway guys, that's it. That's Ever Black Friday. Thank you so much for listening. We'll be back soon with another episode. And as always, to be continued.",

      "text": "Greetings friends, it's Tuesday, January 9th, Chapo, Kamenaccia. It's me Felix and Amber on today's show. And by way of explaining the fact that this is coming out on Tuesday, I would just like to take this moment at the top of the show to send my hearty thank yous to everyone that involved the participants and organizers of the New Bedford Whaling Museum's annual Moby Dick Marathon. I want to shake a shout out the chain for the invite, the unburied books podcast and the artist Tony Millionaire and all of the other Chapo heads who came out to see me read this weekend in New Bedford. It was a great time had by all. However, I would like to take this moment to pick a particular bone with the organization who set this up. Next year you still only three minutes of reading time on that book because the way the chapters were all laid out, I was reader number 73 and I was sitting there like a half hour before my reading and I saw reader 69, reader 70, reader 71, all got to do probably the most iconic part of the book, which is AHAB speech where he says I'll chase them round good hope and round the horn and round the Norway male stream and rounds British and slaves before I give him up and I was just oh that was a rob for me. So I got the chapter right before chapter 39, the one right before chapter 40, which is written like a play, they stopped it at the end of chapter 39 because they had already organized chapter 40 to be done by an acting troupe. So New Bedford Reeling Museum, I'd like those three minutes please and a more media part of the book next time. But no, kidding aside. Was it the part where all the sailors are talking to the morning talk? That's a good chapter though, yeah. I know, but I didn't get to read it. It was done by, it was performed by a troupe of actors. I got to read Stubb's soliloquy where he sort of commits himself to AHAB's suicidal madness. But once again, so thank you to the New Bedford Reeling Museum and the organizers and everyone who said what's up to me this weekend. It was a really really fun experience. I'm sorry, I'm getting the weeds here. Was the Melville Society involved? No, I think this is organized by the the the Wailing Museum, not the Melville Society. I'm a member of the Melville Society. I'm sure we have beef or something, you know? Well, well, I remember a perfect segue because if you're going to talk about beefs between sex of obscure weirdos, then the story I want to lead off this show, it provides nothing but that. Okay, so just by way of introducing this story, I would just like to like set this up by saying, there are weeks where there's a lot to talk about in the news and I feel very like jazz to like get on and record. There are weeks where there's a lot to talk about in the news, but I feel like, oh, that's everything is so depressing and awful. Like how do I ring entertainment out of this? Then there are weeks where there's really nothing going on and I'm like, oh, okay, got a feeling hour. Where are we going to talk about it? Then there are days where one news story happens and I am chomping at the bit to get on the bike because this is just pure fucking gold. And I'm talking about the Habad tunnels. The Habad, the folks, they're digging tunnels and crown heights. A group, a schismatic group of Lubavitschers and crown heights and mere blocks away from the first, the apartment I lived in when this show started many, many years ago have basically been recreating the great escape. And I don't know, a Felix. Okay, so we've all seen the video of that dude popping out from the sidewalk like a Cooper trooper. Felix, when I saw this video, so wouldn't reply to me with like, like, like, like an image that's been stuck with me. And like, I'd like to share with you. And so as soon as I saw that video of that guy popping out of the sidewalk, they just got like a sense that like across the country in Los Angeles, Felix was bolted awake in his bed, eyes the size of dinner plates, like, scat man, crudders in the shining. Just to see like the dibbick soul has been activated. And you just sense that things, the sense that you sense trouble on the East Coast and then lo and behold. Yeah, they're going up there. They're digging a secret tunnel to be closer to Mosaic. So I saw that the Haseed exiting the sewer, the great. Yes. It was just a great on the sidewalk. The great. That was Mosaic. That was, they were right. They didn't say how he'd come back. He crawls out of the sewer. So I got, I got sent that video when it had like 200 likes on it. They sent it to me. And I had to like, I sat in total silence for like two hours because I was like, this has to have really happened. I have to like let it sink in. I have to process this and sit on this for a little while because if I reference this event and it's in a, like, this is just a quantum event that didn't happen in our reality, I am going to sound horrible. Yes. If I think I'm quote tweeting what I perceived to be a video of a Jewish man exiting a sewer grade and running away and I'm like, you know, I describe it and I quote tweeted and it's really just, it's like Samsung advertising new phone. I had to, you know, some quantum event happened. People are going to go, what are you? What the fuck are you talking about? That's the most big, you know, thing I've ever heard. So I really had to sit with it. Once I did and I examined the full thread. So I think everyone, everyone's attention got captured by the guy exiting the sewer. But to me, the best part is when the situation before that when it devolves and the guy, like 20 guys go in the hole. 20 guys go in the tunnel. Because like, it started off like there were no arrests. There was just pushing and shoving and the cops were like, you can't, what the fuck are you doing? You can't build a tunnel that goes into other people's like backyards. Like, you can't have someone who owns a brownstone and they're going out to her to cook breakfast and they're wiping the sleep out their eyes and they're making drip coffee and they see just a half poking out of a little hole with backyard. That's the scariest thing I could ever have had. They're like, you can't do that. And they're like, oh, yeah. And they all, they start fucking walling. They all go in these holes that you didn't see before. They all go walling. They're no clipping. They're moving throughout the fucking building and the cops. Like these were all like Italian, like Guido cops. They was like the Roman Empire in Japan. So go really one AD unlike the Romans had no idea what they were getting in there. They're like, the cops were just like, we got to figure out the shoole. Can we get everyone out of the shoole, please? Little Semitic Prairie dogs just like popping up has to have been like the most confusing thing. You would have to, it feels as right. This is like if their sturmur had like loony tune animations. I feel like, to your point about like having to sit on this because like if you just start talking about a video of a sit at guys popping out of the sewer in Brooklyn, people will think that you're crazy. I want to highlight what I want to highlight what I was talking about. Written about me. You know, yeah. Yeah. This is from the the Jewish Chronicles. This is the first paragraph in there and they're right above it. It says three weeks ago, a New York resident started hearing sounds in his walls. Unlike most people who begin to hear sounds in his walls, he wasn't imagining it. Now Felix, I'm imagining that person because like until this was confirmed, if you just, if like if you just said, I can hear Rabbi speaking Yiddish in my walls. So you would sound like the most anti-Semitic person on the planet. Or just a really religious Jew that had a seizure and now thought he is like, you know, in contact with someone. It was just like the most, like, well, if how many New Yorkers do you think call the police and say, I hear voices in my walls? And this is the one time they're like, you know what, maybe we should take this seriously. They're probably, they're probably the reason they were so many cops there is there probably is an NYPD code for, you know, Yiddish coming out of my walls. You're right. It's probably like a comments gets a frantic thing. And but no, this guy is really happened. I imagine that guy, if he like he, I imagine him as sort of like a young professional who is like, oh, like he's, he's so like he's so afraid of getting fired for saying this. And he's like, I think I just became schizophrenic. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I think I'm just having visions. I've got to, I've got to just take as much lithium as possible because there's no way that's fucking happening. But no, there were, there were rabbis no clipping through his house. My first thought, my first thought was like my, I would be like, well, there goes my mind. That's I was finally, I knew it was going to happen one day. I guess I just live with this now. The main thing that surprised me is that it appears that like they dug the tunnels themselves. And I just figured they would outsource it. Well, that's like the outsource it to outsource even to like even to shuddy subcontractors or guys you hire from Home Depot. Like this is, this is so off books that they're not even doing that. Like I said, they are reenacting the great escape, you know, but when they, when they dug those tunnels, they were called Tom Dick and Harry. This one was worth you as Tom Dov and Adassa. But like I loved like, yeah, so these are like lovingly homemade tunnels. These were no excavator was used. I like, you know those like little plastic shoubles you get on a sandbox when you're a toddler. I feel like they use that. It's so uneven and weird. I love the video because it's like they have like, Hobbads have like a gang of like 20 somethings like tons of young men who are just like, rare and to go. And they have like just this mob of these guys and they're yelling at the cops. I can't make out what they're saying. But it's like, I imagine that they're saying like we deserve a tunnel. What else could you be saying? I sort of read a little bit more from the news account of this as you're a small group of young agitators according to Hobbads chairman Yahuura Khrinsky had been digging a tunnel underneath 770 park Eastern parkway, the global headquarters of Hobbads. The tunnels were discovered in the Hobbad movement took steps to close them off. Last night the situation escalated. Videos across social media showed the interior of the Hobbad house being torn apart, revealing a tunnel entry way the Yashiva students occupied claiming they wanted to study there. A acidic man clambered out of what appeared to be a sewer system around the corner from the house and a hapless police officer was recorded telling the loboboters he wanted to shut down the whole shooel. I want to clear the whole shooel. Oh shooel, why is that? I don't know. I want to fix this tonight. I need the chooel clean. And then the... Why are you looking at the expensive stuff? You're not like this. I'm not looking. That's it. We don't do that in the mirror. I just like... I love the details. Why are we digging the tunnel? We wanted to study there, of course. We want to study in the hole in the ground that we fucking... That is the most plausible part though. We want to go underground to do homework. I have to say, the person that sent me this was Dr. Brace Belden. We were both working on new research on this. We came to the early conclusion that this is a space for a acidic man to smoke crank and his voice x-workers. Because I... Look, a acidic man has vices like anyone else, right? There's a special thing. There's a carve out where it's like, okay, I can smoke crack, but I have to do it in a weird hole. So God can see it. That's true. It's true. Anyone... I don't think it's at a higher rate than other people, like everyone has vices, like I said. But like, the acidic man do everyone else's vices in the weirdest locations you can think of. That is like, you know, when I think of a vast underground system, that's what I think it's for. It's just smoking crank and sucking off, man. Yeah. Isn't the last like porn of theater, and just in Queens or something, and it's just like exclusively Hossies? Yeah, yeah. No, yeah, it's... They need, I mean, talk about a third space. You know? What? Well, like, I like... I like... Okay, like, I mean, this is like... I mean, basically this boils down to like a question, sort of like a disputed ownership of what is like the... Is... What is described as the mecca of the Habbad movement worldwide? You know, like on Eastern Parkway, it's like there are world headquarters. And there's some sort of like dueling proprietary claims about like which rabbi owns this space. And this is not understanding. The genesis of this... Of the tunnel, the tunnel brawl was that... This is this group of young men who are sort of like a totally inscrutable different sect of the Habbad movement who believe that the previous head of the Eastern Parkway, that the rabbi who presided over it, rabbi Schneerson, who is in their eyes, Mosiah. He is... He is the ancient man, if you're ever in Crown Heights, that they put on posters and blackers to say, Mosiah is here. He died like 10 years ago, but they think he's still alive. And apparently they dug this tunnel to the closer to the ritual bath in which he bathed himself. Still with me? Still following the story? Yeah, but it's not... It's not fucking international waters, you're underground. Yeah, no, I like the idea that it's like homesteading if you go into the walls or the land underneath property. It's just, you know, help for anyone. But go down, young man. Yeah. As Matt might say, now that the It's Free real estate is done above ground, the last frontier of America is subterranean. As I understand it, well, the main schism here is that the tunnel guys... Well, their sect is into explicitly saying that guy is Mosiah. And then the anti-tunnel guys are into just implying it. How... Staff, who I interviewed about the AMIA bombing described it to me. He's an expert. It's very Protestant, right? They have like bumper stickers that say like, you know, he's, you know, around or whatever. I don't remember what it actually says, but there's a ton of those, you know, dented vans like with that bumper sticker on it. I still don't totally understand how it relates to going underground. And I do like the fact that when the police arrived, they all just went real housewives and started just like flipping tables as if those were going to be barricades or something. It was the weirdest confrontation I think I have ever seen. Yeah. It's... That is the best way to describe it. Incomprehensible confrontation. Yeah. And Amber, I saw an argument on like a Crown Heights, like a local message board where one, one Jewish guy is like, this is great. I love the tunnels. Mosiah is here. Like, no, not connecting the two thoughts. It's just like, it's supposed to be one of those things like it's raining. Therefore, you know, there are clouds in the sky. Like obviously the tunnels are here. Mosiah is here. One would not be here without the other. And then the guy underneath him is like, look buddy, I think the tunnels are okay. But like, we know what the Messiah is here. You sound crazy. It's so bonkers that it just reminds me of sitting around like Thanksgiving and everyone would be talking about like the weather or changing their tires or, I don't know, firewood or whatever redneck talk about. And then like randomly out of nowhere, some elderly aunt would be like, any day now, meaning Jesus is coming back. Anything like just a non-sequator. It's very Protestant to just have those non-sequators in there. Everything about it is so weird that the NYPD, who you know, we'll say are thoroughly trained in like, seduing our people. Yeah, if you stand no idea what to do, there's no idea what to do. The person like you said Felix, in any past life, that NYPD guy, like trying to control the Lubobitschers was like a Roman centurion. Because he looks like the most Italian guy ever. And he goes, look, he goes, are you from Israel? And he goes, I can't even understand what the guys are saying. He goes, are you from Israel? And then he goes, looks at him and goes, you don't do that here in America. You need some sort of bonded tradesmen to do, structural work on a building. Because apparently they were digging the tunnel. And they started doing this back during COVID, apparently. Like I said, I keep the thing of the great escape. And you know what? How the houses like they wear the wall coats here round. I think this is all just a cons that they can like sneak out the dirt that they're shoveling out of this tunnel and dispersing it on Easter Parkway. So no one gets the wiser as to what they're up to. But if I could just read a little bit more from this, it says here, about six months ago, it appears that a group of Yashiva students associated with a messianic movement began to dig tunnels, connecting the synagogue with an unused NICVA to gain unauthorized access to 770. When the Kabad authorities learned of the illegal tunnel network, which could have threatened the integrity of the buildings above it, it called in a cement truck to fill in the tunnels. It was the arrival of the truck, which began pouring cement into the open tunnel that caused the chaos. In the resulting conflict, at least 10 arrests were made by the NYPD who evacuated the shul and locked the doors yesterday evening. The tunnels are now being filled in. Rabbi Yuhuda Khrinsky, chairman of the Kabad said, these odious actions will be investigated and the sanctity of the synagogue will be restored. He also gave thanks to the NYPD for their professionalism and sensitivity. I mean, and apparently they were digging the tunnel under the women's, under the women's Bicba. So I'm just saying, at the next service, like the women's half of the synagogue is just going to fall through the tunnel. What are they going to do? What are they going to do after they're on the reg? That's a whole issue. They got nothing now. They got, you know what? I was just saying, I think it might be a patriarchal religion. They don't even let you do the thing that you have to do. I don't also, there's no way that guy didn't know what was happening. Oh, no, some young agitator. No fucking way. I just, I love the idea that like their solution to this problem was like, we need to study the Vietnam. We need a fucking tunnel system. We need to put Pooji sticks outside where the, I don't know where the canter lives. We need to take it out. We need to, we need to fucking suicide bomb the guy who sells HTC phones in this neighborhood. They, I just, I don't, again, just like how I don't understand how the tunnels connect to the Messiah turning. I don't understand how like, they're like, okay, we have this dispute with this guy. Let's do what Bugs Bunny did to Florida. Let's just saw this building. So it falls through the fucking earth. South America, take it away. He took a long, wrong turn in Albuquerque and just like a fucking makeup bath with a bunch of naked ass, juices, falls on his fucking head. I don't, it doesn't make any sense. Also, these Jews have not had a history of manual labor for what like a hundred years. I like to think I'm a pretty handy person. I don't know if I could do a great escape style tunnel without fearing it collapsing on my head. Amber, Amber, necessity, necessity is the mother of invention. And you know, like if you build, if you build it, a mosaic will come. That's what I'm learning about these tunnels. And you keep saying, I don't understand it. I don't understand it. Amber, it's not for you to understand. And this is, and this is really what I gotta say. I'm just trying to get back to it. I wouldn't say that art like necessarily have an aptitude for traditional manual labor or like being handy in a traditional sense where something breaks and you repair it in a way that makes sense. But they, they, they will engage in it if it's part of like an insane, just an insane multi-step scheme that makes no sense. Like we knew a guy in New York who he had, his group of friends was in Paris. Incredible. It was like a focus group. You'd go to his house and he would have like a 57 year old Latino repairman, like a black comedian in his mid 20s, a youngish acidic guy, a 45 year old. A woman wearing a hijab with a prosthetic leg. Yeah, yeah. It was, it was insane. It was, it was awesome. He just totally organically knew all these people. But we, the Hasey guy there, he, he talked to me one time and he explained how, in like a 400 step plan, how you can smoke in a rental car and they'll end up giving you $35. Yeah, and, and, like, that all, that all is to say that like, you know, maybe these guys aren't like in their day to day lives wouldn't be excavating. But if it's part of an insane plan in service of $45 that works out to like half a cent per like hour of labor. Over the course of three years, they'll do it. Yeah. And again, all they do is, all they do is study. So, you know, they probably got some like, you know, how to DIY YouTube videos up. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You like those videos are guys in India like build the pool with their hands, but it's the most stupid thing in the world. Yeah. But what I want to say like overall about this story, is that like, I want to, I want to really like thank the laboratories and the, the Havad community in New York because like every bird for gifting us with this like, but what will be probably the funnest story of 2024 because I had a feeling the rest of the rest of this year is going to be all bad probably. We're giving us the funnest story of 2024. But I guess I want to say like, I have to admit to a certain grudging respect for the aesthetic community in New York City, despite the fact that I regard them to be a group of malingering women and children abusers. There's something about the fact that like everyone else in New York City is like so stressed out all the time and just ground down by like the, the, the chore of having to live in New York City and to get along with everyone and, and make rent and fucking like, you know, just, it's just a constant rat race. But you got, you got to give it to them. They're just doing their own thing. They don't give a fuck about anything else. They don't give it, they're, they're, they're, they're too blessed to be stressed. They don't give a fuck about building permits, the fucking dig a tunnel. They don't care about structural integrity. You remember when COVID was going on and they were just having like 9,000 person indoor funerals? Yeah. Like, it's certainly you just have to tip their cap at a certain point and just be like, you know, they're, they're, they're doing their thing and they don't give a fuck about anything else. They're centrally located libertarians, which is the weirdest thing to me. Like, I understand the, the omnis in the men and nights. Like, they live outside of town. They got their own thing going. But to do that exact same thing in the middle of the densest metropolis in the country is, I mean, they really, they figured out how to section themselves off without the benefit of geography. They're just full on libertarian. It would be like, it would be like if Waco was in Crown Heights. It's so bad. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Like, I'm kind of where you're at where like previous things that like upset me. And it's like, look, I think it's bad to be like, hey, a woman who I have nine kids with, you can't have the Android phones that aren't listed anywhere else. You're not allowed to contact the outside world. You're, you, you can't leave. I think it's bad to do that. Yeah. I think a lot of stuff that do is bad. But this, this is kind of won me over. I remember the first time. Yeah. I saw them though. It was like a movie here and there was a woman like freshly shaved head. Like she had just got out. And there was protests because they were trying to sit at the pad. They said, well, in a whole lot of law, women can't have smart phones. And like, that's what the friend does about this woman who had just left shaved head was holding up a sign that says sorry to bring down the room. But it said a cell phone never raped me. It's like, oh, this isn't, this is dark shit. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But that's why I think this is good because it's like instead of like, you know, abuse and a culture of silence and like, you know, like beating up any black kid who's unfortunate enough to like, like, through the neighborhood at night. This is like good silent film type mischief. This is the type of thing they need to get into. And I have to say, I love the idea of hollowing out the entire, all the infrastructure and the foundation and everything around the women's part of the building because when they fall through the earth. There's just going to be forever, forever. There's just going to be a whole, a huge hole in the ground filled with wings. There's going to be a canyon of wigs in New York and everyone can come and see it'll be the new, a new wonder of the world. Just a hundred, I do love that they went with like the, the 63 Jackie O with the pillbox hat. It's just going to be those exact wigs with pillbox hats, which might give them an amazing like that could save their lives if they hit bottom. It might be like, what are those things when you slide out of an airplane? Yeah, they're incredibly thick. They're very, you know, I think they're, they deflect at least most small arms fire. Well, I mean, like, look, I think other communities in New York City should like sort of like take, take from this example and do some sort of unlicensed infrastructure work on the city. I'm currently considering a project to tunnel into the club basement because they turned me away at the door for being too old and heterosexual to get into this club. So I'm currently engaging in, you know, I'm like Charles Bronson in the great escape basically. I'm getting into that fucking club. I don't care. Well, you know, speaking of, you know, one group that I've gained a book-rugging respect for through their absurd and idiotic actions, I'd like to talk now about an individual who I gained a lot of respect for her absurd and stupid actions, but I've lost it precipitously. You look, she's not talking about the great poster and artist, Neary Oxman. Yeah. Yeah, like, so a little bit better than that. She is the wife of Bill Ackman, Ackman and Oxman. It sounds like, I don't know, like phase 10 of the Marvel universe after they've cashed out all the eternal characters that no one remembered. But so like, he's the Hitchman. He's like, so Bill Ackman, like, he's the guy who's been like, you know, sort of behind this Harvard-Bruha-ha. I mean, he got very angry because, you know, Palestinian students got angry that their relatives were being killed and he was just like, oh, I want their names. So I never hired them. And then, you know, he was promoting, heavily, the President Gays, Playserism thing and the lone behold that turns out his wife, who was a professor at MIT, who gave Orbs to Jeffrey Epstein. She plays her as much of her, she plays her as much of her MIT thesis from Wikipedia and other sources. But like, basically, like, I'm annoyed by this because, similar to Linda Yaccarino, I don't like people who are like perfect, beautiful idiots having to get involved in political controversies that like sort of soures it for me. Yeah, I, like, before I knew anything about this woman, I was like, oh, she's got to be the fucking worst, you know, because like, you're running out on a piece of paper. It's like, MIT, she made art for Jeffrey Epstein. She's married to fucking Bill Ackman. Oh, my God, this lady probably sucks. She's as rally. And then you read her post and you're like, this is a perfect mind. I had no idea. I found a treasure trove of old, nearly oxman posts, not even old from like a few years ago. And they are all, it's all shit like love isn't measured by time. Time is measured by care. And you have in an age of hugs, be a kiss. It's all just things from like Airbnb art. Yeah. Yeah. But even like that would even, the stuff in those things would even be too clever for her. I, it's great because she, I really come out liking her. And I think we could get Bill Ackman thrown in prison because this woman is not capable of consent. I have a few of her actual tweets. Do not be grounded by your dreams. Dream up your grounding. And like, you know what I mean? What? Yeah, no, like, Amber, like they have the construction of Airbnb text based art, but they make no sense. They're just gibberish. Like, yeah, don't be grounded by your dreams. Dream up your grounding. And then, okay, here's another one. No, no clue. Bating and fly fishing to oppose forms of existence. One produces rage. The other inspires generosity. In the age of the Anthropocene, empathy is just as valuable as carbon sequestration. Without it, we are lost. In an age when we can have it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Can we try to, I don't think we're going to get to the bottom of this one because we really start like, what's, yeah, like she, she can't be in literal fly fishing. Obviously, I think she does. No, she does it because like one, like clickbaiting is like, oh, it's like you're at a, you're at a desktop. It's you're in the moment. You're like, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm raged by this. I want to get some clicks. And then you're, you know, you waited into the river. You're flicking out your lure. You're just like the, the current is passing you by, you know, the sun is out. You're grounded. You're, you're dreamed in your grounding when you're fly fishing. I, yeah, I, but what, but what if she didn't say, you know, ladder and former, what if she went, she bought the hipwaters, she went out to Montana and she just became like a vengeful person based on like fly fishing. And she's saying clickbait is like, you know, unlikely animal friends. I feel like, I feel like if she and Eric Adams had sex, it would produce the events of the comic book preacher. It would shoot a dead, even angel baby out in the world and infest the body of a young man who's forced to preach in South Texas. It's a, you know, who knows what phrases these two would come up with. Okay. Here's another like this and there's another paired tweet here. So actually, because while counting bags filled with recyclables to my daughter's school earlier today, I found myself asking, how is this little bag going to make a difference? Here tonight, she challenged me to count all the stars in the sky one at a time. Hope is the ability to perceive infinity as a measurable quantity and act upon it with conviction and innocence and equal portions, be it fixing the climate crises, saving lives or counting stars. I am still counting. Okay. I was about to say, I was about to say, this is tragic if Neary's daughter, like clearly knowing what her mom, right, right. Really yeah, count all the, count all the sand on the beach. But like literally Neary's daughter knowing what's up with her is like, you know, doing like doing the things kids do, a fucking with her parents knowing her dingbat mom will literally try to do this. The thing was literally stand outside like a fucking turkey. One fuck I lost my count. She was for four years before Bill Akman daughter. I just thought like maybe her daughter is also on DMT or something like it does sound like they are on a similar wavelength. It could be a trick totally, but maybe they're just vibing out to the same drug. I mean that, the count all the stars in the sky, that is like a normal thing like a three year old or four year old says, right? Like they love, you know, it's like they're learning language. They're learning like sort of primordial jokes, right. Wait, why are she counting cans anyway? What does that have to do with it? What's that program? We got so in the weeds about the language. I don't know. Are they are they having children do recycling in New York City public schools? I think you're missing the forest from the tunnels here. Neary oxman is an MIT educated dingbat. She does yarn art for rich people. She's a moron. She's a moron and he looks the question about counting how many stars in this guy. Didn't RxK left you do the same thing on American terrorists? What he has at the Kingdom Hall and he's like, who counted them? He said, you can do the stars. How you could count them? Show me them. I so like this, right. This one's amazing because like the premise of it is it's hopeful to think that like basically that infinity isn't infinity, right? Because if you could quantify, if you could count it, that's not what infinity is. I don't know why that's optimistic, but she has such a dog brain that she's literally trying to do that like before she goes to bed. She's like, I think I can achieve a way of counting that breaks reality. Okay. By 11 p.m. probably. Okay. I watched the, I was Catherine, we were in the hotel and we watched other twilight movies this week and people were like, I commented on it so people were selling me all kinds of insane twilight facts which honestly doing it episode on those books and movies would be fent would be amazing because they are a true glimpse into the Mormon mind palace. Yes. So definitely mine rewrote the first twilight book from Edwards perspective and someone today sent me a page from that book where it describes like Edwards internal monologue in which like to sort of suppress his natural desire to drain the blood from Bella, he begins to calculate how many insects are in a square foot of dirt and then keeps expanding the area to like the school, the county and then just keeps doing insect math in his head to like prevent him from sinking his teeth and turn something. Man would rather count it insects than get there to be. What the fuck? But I mean like she's, I mean she has a genuinely beautiful mind but her husband on the other hand is just immediate and like he has nothing of nothing of value to contribute. Like time is love caring for earth or something like that. And like in it, what I love about Bill Ackman, I don't really know who Bill Ackman was until like he started spouting off about this shit. I just like knew it was a guy who had like a billion dollars in white hair and he's sort of like, I don't know, the male Phoebe Bridgers and the financial world. I guess that's how I sort of conceived of him. But like his defenses of his wife are like only, he's making it worse for his wife at every passing moment because like in one of his defenses of her, he writes, at some point she was asked to give him one of the orbs, small resin sculptures that her group made which MIT used as gifts for donors to the university. Near East group made many of the gifts for MIT media lab donors as her unique work is unique and beautiful. She doodifully did what she was called. A referring to giving a making her students craft or a misrejefery upstead. I love that. I love that because it was like, but if he didn't say that, I don't think I ever would have known exactly what Mary did at MIT. But they literally, they are, they spent tens of billions of dollars to have this woman do fucking arts and crafts. I thought MIT, I thought they invented computers that were so scary that they came up with particles that ended the universe. I didn't know they were doing, they were doing, you know, fucking, lilyfare over there. No, her art is like the people who cover trees with yarn. Like I've seen pictures of it. It's that type of person. I hate textile art. I hate it. It was, there was one outside of my apartment in New York and it was just like, it was like sagging and mildewing and I'm just like, way to like make the landscape of this part of Brooklyn even more disgusting. But yeah, I just like, but Bill, Bill Akman, so like he's this hedge fund guy who is like, I guess like a big Israel booster and a big herver donor. And like he, like, he wanted, you know, he wanted to get Claudine gay out of there because he felt that she didn't react as he didn't, she didn't jump, she didn't jump high enough when he said, you know, fire or expel all of these pro-Palestinian students. So they came after her for some plagiarism in her, in her fucking degree. And by the way, I mean, like, I hope this just keeps going because I think everybody is plagiarizing all the time. Wait, I don't think there's anybody who hasn't advanced in Vietnam who doesn't plagiarize something. I think they're all, they're all capping a thousand percent and they're all guilty. At that level for sure. But like Bill Akman's reactions to his wife doing like textbook blatant plagiarism of the dumbest kind, like literally copying from Wikipedia, he, like, he's, they've settled on this defense now where they're like, there are unwritten codes and rules and you never go after someone's wife. And it's just like you made her, like you made her involved in all of this by opening your fucking mouth in the first place. And another thing that really annoys me about of this is a Felix. I learned from you that this Bill Akman guy is the character, is the guy who the character of Bobby Axelrod is based on. And that makes me so fucking mad at how billions has lied to me. I thought Bobby Axel's a cool genius, but no, he's this fucking, he's just this moron. No, Bobby Axelrod is a composite character. He's based on a few guys. He's based more on Steve Cone that the guy who forced him to his employees and ran the mess into the ground after $5 billion. Yes, Steve Cone's awesome. I love him. He's a fucking psycho. He's, I love, I love him. He's what I want my hedge fund guys to be. Someone who like, you know, does all the stuff in billions where it's like I paid a guy to pretend to be a fucking Malaysian guy's wife for five years. So he could help me how much grain was going to come on a ship so I can make $700 million. He does all that shit. I Steve Cone rocks. He will assassinate a minor league pitching coaches father in law to make $30,000. He's the coolest guy. Bill Akman sucks. Bill Akman got outsmarted by her beloved. That never would happen to Bobby Axelrod Steve Cone. He's so cool. Wasn't he shorted or he shorted her life? Yeah, he shorted her life and like did all these interviews where he's like, it doesn't, it's stupid. I took the vitamins and they didn't do anything. And everyone was like, okay, Bill. And then Carl icon was like, I actually think her life's pretty cool. And he, he like, he bought a bunch of their stock and Akman lost like hundreds of millions of dollars. He, he sucks. And I, my favorite defense he did of Neri was when he said, imagine this is happening to you. Imagine that a reporter is emailing you saying you copy and pasted a Quora post. You know, imagine that's happening. Imagine that happened to you and you were an introvert. Yeah. And it's like Bill, Bill, you were saying that we should publicly whip all these 18 year olds. Not that long ago. Bill, what are you talking about? I know, like, I, it's like I do agree. You shouldn't be like, like, before I knew about Neri, I was like, yeah, screw her. And now it's like, let's rescue her from Bill. Let's, you know, like, like, let's make a non-eval place where she can make yard and fucking Christmas ornaments and shit. Stick a tunnel under the MIT media lab. Yeah. Probably just been like blasted with whatever the version of NK Ultra still is running in MIT. Like, she's just like out to lunch. You know, oh, my God. Wait, what if what if the Hibaga is their white hats and they know that Bill Ackman is bad. And the tunnel is meant to go all the way to Greenwich, Connecticut, to rescue Neri. Oh, my, I think we have a new QAnon. Yes. They're going to invade his like fucking giant mansion that looks like the Protestant Vatican. It's like, they're just all pop through the floor. That's so fucking cool. Imagine. Okay, imagine all these 20-year-old Hossies. Bill Ack, 30. So you guys like the shittiest beards you've ever seen. It's like, it's like, it's like the raid. The last evil compound. He's surrounded by like black cube and black water guys. All these fucking stairwells and out operators are like 340 Neri is not leading her arts and crafts room. We have. He's in the nest. We have her counting all the blood cells in her body. Your wife is sure. And he's like, ah, good. I'm going to lose another $300 million trying to short the Stanley Tumblr today. And I have I'm going to get I'm going to get a high school student fired from the JV cheerleading squad. He's doing all that stuff. And then suddenly, like just like the raid, these Jews are repelling down his mansion. And they take their they take their hats and they throw it like a job and it decapetates. The last few guys. That's so fucking cool. Oh, man. Oh, man. Yeah. Yeah, that's a little like roadtun starts fed bodies. They could just ball up. Yeah. Yeah. The black water guys are firing, you know, three, three, eight rounds into them. There's somehow going through their course. So not hitting any organs. They're just they're just hitting body hair. Nothing. I mean, no, I mean, free free neary from this horrible this horrible entrapment that she's suffering. Let her do her stupid art free from political controversy. But no, her stupid husband Bill Ackman is making that impossible because he's writing probably 10 posts a day. Each of them 20,000 words long further indicted his wife and like defending her from these charges that are like totally, I mean, like cannot be defended from. And he keeps saying this thing about like there was no due process involved in this. We were only given 90 minutes to respond to business insider. What do you mean due process? This isn't a fucking court. Like I really would do process. What are you talking about? And then like, oh, yeah. And then Christopher Rufo saying even the mafia doesn't go after people's wives and kids. It's like, yeah, they kill people for money, but they would never reveal someone's wife's plagiarism of Wikipedia. I love how he's sort of like transitioned himself into like pretending to be like everyone perceives him as some gravy-stained Dego and not just like the nerdiest kid who brings a briefcase to school. Yeah, with with Bill. Okay, I got to say this. One of the worst emails are calls you will ever get in your life. And I hope this never happens to you is someone on the other end. You pick up. Hi, I'm writing an article about you. Yeah. That's the worst. That's how I could tell you about a couple of those phone calls up. Yeah, instantly killing you and myself. That's happening. But you know, it's the after the first time it happens, it's not so bad. You know, it's like, okay. Well, one thing you get one phone call from a journalist telling you that you've been added to a $100 million lawsuit. There's nothing. There was no due process there, by the way. But yeah, you'll usually make unless you did something crazy, you know, unless you like killed someone last year, you're probably fine. Unless you're a really crazy person. But like, if you, you know, I, you know, I am a successful businessman, but I'm not a billionaire like Bill Ackman. But if this is inside a road and article where it's like, it's not even me. This stupid woman you have sex with is bad at homework. I really want to. It's not me. I don't care. But he is like, he's going to kill himself over a fucking business insider article. Like that is so pathetic to me. We've had, you know, articles written about us, unfair articles about things that I said on purpose. Things that were unfairly brought up in and out of context during a 12 year mental breakdown that is ongoing. I'm really persecuting me. And I was fine. I never was like, you, you sir are the mafia. But he's like, he's, he's going to fucking, he's going to be a family annihilator because this article that 3,000 people are going to read. He's insane. Steve, Steve Cohn would have already like paid a guy to, I don't know, like crash a blimp into the MetLife building. He would have figured something out. But stupid ass Bill Ackman is just making it worse. And like, you know, like they've already like Bill Ackman because he has billions of dollars. Like was already able to like, I don't know, like, like, angrily call up the owners of business insider. And they announced that like they're doing some sort of like internal investigation into the quote, the motivations, not the facts of this story. But they're motivations in publishing the facts, which is like, I don't know. It's funny when some rich asshole is revealed to be a huge hypocrite. I would think that would be the motivation behind any news article of this sort. Dude, business insider is page six for business. That is why you read it. All of those fucking WeWork leaks that I got were, were just like footnotes and business insider. They anonymized people to bitch about like, you know, multi billion valued fucking tech companies to just be like, there's no soap in the, in the bathrooms. Like it's so fun. I recommend it to anyone. That's how I felt like I had a Newman was a barefoot guy. Well, I mean, just, I'm just, just cheers to the fucking bomb Bill Ackman. There's absolute bozo for fucking ruining the life of his beautiful wife. And that was who's a wonderful artist who I think I think our orbs should get, you know, I don't think I, what is Jeffrey I've seen the only one who gets these special orbs. You know, I would like an order. I want an order. Yeah, free, free, Neary. Did you see, um, you know, my favorite guy in the saga, probably the only guy who came out looking good. The guy who should be married to nearly Indian guy. Yeah. KK, so at scientists underscore KK on Twitter. This is this is like Lady Chatterle's lover. I want to read you some of their beautiful responses. Neary says in 2016, if you get stuck with anything, just change scales. Then four years later, KK scientists replies, I sex you early. Again, in 2016, Neary Oxman tweets, I miss a straight line. Four years later, again, in 2020, KK scientists, I sex you. In 2016, again, wanting to want is more wanted than wanted. But then it takes you X chromosomes to live by second order derivatives in Leibin's notation. I sex you for years. I just think that love doesn't care about time. It times care. Okay, lifetime, but alone you come India. She should be with this is the love story of the art. He's made for what he likes. Yeah. That is the only thing you can say to those thoughts. All the other replies are like Gen X guys who shouldn't be allowed on airplanes being like, you your words are like a soft bullet, Neary. And I'm like, you know, it's a guy so fucking guy named Howard and it's like how we're down. Neither of you are capable of consent. Shut the fuck up. But her and KK said like they are, they are made for each other. When someone says this bird brain shit to you and someone goes up to you and is like, we put, we put our lunch in a container. Well, what do we do with the greatest moments of our lives? We just remember them. All you, what do you say to her except I sex you come to come to Carbala, you know, they think he's a he's a winner bill, Bill Akman, so fucking loser. What do you think this guy would say if like business insider was like, we're writing an article about you. You'd be like, I'll fucking, I'll have sex with you too. Come to India. I'll fuck you too. You think I'm done with this? I had no due process to the I sex you come to India tweets. I only had 90 minutes to respond. I only had 90 minutes to reply to every tweet saying, well, sex you come to India. That is, I have to say that is the funniest in the end reply guy I've ever seen because it's like, usually you see those guys reply to like famous women and shit. Neary Oxford is such a weat. Like she's honestly, she's very beautiful, but like, it's such a weird show. Like how does he know about her? Especially like eight years ago. So I want to interview that guy. Like, is he an actual scientist? Is that how he knows her? Maybe. Maybe it's all this is like the thing, you know, if that's, if that's bill, then I, you know, I'm taking everything I said. Yeah, take back everything I said about bill. Okay. Do you want to talk about is Taylor Swift gay or not? Because I mean, I've been like that. No, he and Matt are on record with this. He's actual. Well, just the I sex you tweets made me think of my favorite tweet this week. What the hell is this Taylor Swift? Your coward ass is always hiding behind press releases. You were a spineless lobster. You're still gay and that's final. I just, I will, I mean, like all of this is like, he was at the golden globe the other night with her friend and they were, you know, holding hands or something. And like, I don't know, like, apparently, so I just were all aware. Like Taylor Swift is the godhead of American women. And I think like, because like her music is so popular, I think because like people read into like experiences that they think she's writing about like directly like one to one correlations of their own life. And like, I think she has like, there's now like an emergence of a kind of like a like a gay swifty contingent who is obsessed with like, interpreting these kind of like nonverbal sort of cues and signals from Taylor that she is part of the LGBTQ community. And then there are some free LGBTQ and on. But like, I actually have to say I remember this on the message boards like from like 10 years ago. And I don't remember why Taylor Swift kept coming up, but there I remember a woman like saying like, yeah, there are public profile closeted lesbians, okay. Taylor Swift and she was getting really mad about it. So I wonder if she's like the leader of this. I mean, I'm talking like 10 years ago. I just thought she was a professional beard like looking at her dating history. But like I don't think she's gay, but I do think there's one. There's one cult leader of this movement that has been working for years and years and like led a kind of a kind of QAnon for Taylor Swift sexuality. Well, I mean, like, well, Amber, as you correctly stated, you and Matt are firmly on the record coming down that she is ace, that she is asexual or Matt says, Matt says he thinks he doesn't have genitals. She's sort of like a biblically accurate angel or something like that. I think she has them. I simply think she has never had sex. It does not occur to her. It is a no interest. Well, the LGBTQ Swiss true true and not the LGBTQ and on, uh, Swift contingent has gained purchase in the op-ed real estate of the New York Times. And that's really what I want to talk about because of this great op-ed piece in the New York Times titled, look what we made Taylor Swift do by Anna Marx that sort of like lays out some of the evidence here. And I just like to read a little bit from it, including one of my favorite openings of a New York Times op-ed piece, ostensibly about the sexuality of Taylor Swift. It begins like this in 2006, the your Taylor Swift released her first single, a closeted country singer named Shelley Wright, then 35 held a nine millimeter pistol to her mouth. That's that's the opening. That's the opening. It's like, it's like, let's get a couple to me. Honestly, yeah. I still think she's ace. I think she's one of those, uh, like non-a romantic ace people. And I think she's like a lot of professional beardry. Yeah. So like, I guess like the first couple of paragraphs talking about this, this, this country signal came out and like, I'm like sort of the difficulty she faced because you know, like Nashville is a more conservative and entertainment culture. And she writes, uh, what if someone had already tried at least once to change the culture by becoming such a hero? What if because our culture had yet to come to terms with homophobia, it wasn't ready for her? What if that hero's name was Taylor, Alison Swift? And I just want to say like these are some of like the, the, uh, the dossier assembled of like the evidence for Taylor Swift's gayness. It says here, in 2019, she was set to release a new album, Lover. The first since she had left big machine records, her old national base label, which was, which she has since said limited her creative freedom. The aesthetic of what would be known as the Lover era emerged as rainbows, butterflies and pastel shades of blue, purple and pink, colors that subtly evoke the bisexual pride flag. On April 26, Lesbian, lesbian visibility day, Mizz Swift released an album, the album's lead single, Me in which she sings about self love and self acceptance. She co-directed a campaign music video to accompany it in which she later will describe as depicting everything that makes me me. It features Mizz Swift dancing at a pride parade, dropping rainbow paint and turning down a man's marriage proposal in exchange for a pussy cat. Hmm, interesting. I mean, like I, as the evidence begins to be assembled, you know, it's sort of like, you know, I feel like it's just like Jim Garrison here. Yeah. Then Mizz Swift performed Mizz Swift performed, shake it off as a surprise for patrons at the Stonewall Inn. Rumors that were perhaps more, perhaps a little more than fantasy, swirled in the queer corners of her fandom. Stoked by a suggested post by the fashion designer, Christian Serrano, would Mizz Swift attend New York City's world pride march on June 30th, would she wear a dress bun from a rainbow, would she give a speech? If she did, what would she declare about herself? I gotta say, this is just a, okay, if you are a Shantuz, appealing to the gaze who are the most loyal fans in the universe is just a good business move. And it doesn't always work. Katie Perry tried and fell on her face. And I think Taylor Swift is about that money. I think she's about that bag. Yeah, absolutely. Like, you want to get on the side of the gaze. Because I don't think it's going to work that much. Because like, all the things that like, like, like heterosexual women do and like fandoms, or they're like, all like, you know, like the slang words that they use and sort of the fan culture. Like, it's the genesis of that comes from gay fandom. And like, they're the one that starts with like, oh, we're going to get the slay, slay, cost, mother, or kind, you know, things like that. Absolutely. And I think even when you look at like, I don't think there are that many Katie Perry stands. Like, you know, you've either got them or you don't. I think there's probably some, some very, Buttigieg style millennial men who, they've picked Katie Perry instead of, you know, Robin or something. But those are losers. Megan trainer. Yeah, Megan trainer like that mother, that mother song, like that was that was a sweaty sweaty grab for gay affection and attention. I also could not figure out was she talking to her husband and saying, call me, I, that was a very disturbing, confusing song. Mother's mother's Taylor Swift must be gay. It must be incredibly gay and that's final. Well, yeah, I mean, just just best of luck to Taylor and Travis. What I will say about Taylor Swift is, does she have to go to every single chiefs game? Like, what is this fucking high school? Like, okay, if they get to play off, that's one thing. Maybe that the home opener, but she was at every fucking chiefs game this year. It's just, it's trying a little too hard. What's her quote unquote, boyfriend's name again? Travis Kelsey. Okay. I'm, I'm stealing Molly's take on this, but she, she predicts that Travis Kelsey and Taylor Swift will get married because they have the exact same like energy and it, including this down to sexuality, they are both actually sexually attracted to their jobs. That is where they derive all, all satisfaction, all, you know, reward. And they are on the same wavelength there. And I think that that is, and I think that Travis is the, the perfect like dog brained American energy given by from his old, old tweets that are very much in that like, Nelly, John Rove just like, like, damn, moon, huge tonight, stuff like that. Yeah. I think there's nothing better than watching movies on hashtag TV. I think I can see that. I, Chris, I think the one like, mutual beard is always a good arrangement. They could do a well and jada thing. But I think additionally, like, you need someone with a big, big beaming smile, a wholesome style, tight end, and that is not a joke. That's what he is. Yes. He has a tight end. Yeah. Well, I mean, yeah, I guess just a wrap up today show, Miss Swift, your gay and that's final. Miss Oxman, you need to be saved and that's final. The, the, the acidic tier one operators are tunneling to your, to your yard dungeon as we speak. The, the, the halacic raid is happening. Bill Acman's evil compound. You will be saved. Bill Acman, you are done. You were fucking, you were, you were done. Because like the only thing that's going to stop your way from going to jail for plagiarism is the halacic raid. Oh, do you imagine how cool it will be when like the, the head, like the raid guy of the raid, he could, he fucking garrets Bill Acman with Teflin. That will be so cool. That'll be so cool. No more fucking 70,000 word tweets that only make his life, his, his wife's life worse. They are going to do it. I believe in them. They look, they already, you know, no clip against the NYPD. They can take down Bill Acman's crash knobs. Well, Felix, I discovered they have, they have flame throwers and there's a genre of, of Jewish YouTube video where I don't know if it's one guy or if it's, if it's built up, it like, you know, it's the pool guys, but he sterilizes or, or, you know, kosherizes houses with the flame thrower, but it's always like David Getham music. He's so pissed up. It's so awesome. It's so, yeah, no, this guy would be on the raid, dude. So he's sterilizing houses by burning them down? I think he does it on like, granite countertops or whatever. Okay, okay. Okay. Okay, okay. So he's like, he's like, you know, maybe he might accidentally burn it. Oh, what? Because like, maybe like, Oh, is this like a kosher va thing? Like, because like, maybe like, like, like shellfish was previously maybe used on that marble countertops and he got a blast with a flame thrower? Like, maybe have to have kosher flames. Oh, that makes sense. I thought that sounded crazy before he was fling it. He was dangerous. I mean, ship lap is still very popular no matter how it's acted. There's a lot of tribe. One in the kitchen these days. Or Micah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, yeah. And so, you know, the people at 770 Eastern Parkway, I just say like, just keep doing what you're doing. Keep doing. Don't let anyone stop you. Just like shine on you crazy diamond. And I'm, I'm getting into basement one way or the other. And I'm sorry. I'm just, I'm still thinking of, I'm still thinking of Felix as like a Jewish scatman, brothers, but like, and he has a huge poster of Rachel Senet over his bed. Yeah. All right. All right, gang. Till next time. But would you have any plugs? Do you have any plugs to do? Uh, I remember his book. I am. My Embers book. Yeah. My Embers book. My other book. The book. And then, and then put it on Instagram. So I can post the things and, and because I don't have anything to post now. Nobody wants to see my hiking trips or my dogs. I just got to do all the books and, and take pictures, set it to me. I will or tag me. I will, I will repost it. And, uh, be forever grateful. One day I will repay this favor to you. All right, everybody. Uh, cheers. And, uh, let's, let's have ourselves, let's keep it, let's keep the synergy going into January. Let's keep digging tunnels, everybody. All right. Later. Bye. I'm so scared what it's they care. They said it. Seven weeks, seven weeks, seven weeks, seven weeks until your dogs get a sky. I ain't even heard that number before. Today told me that line. I had a phone hold on. What's telling us go get what praise the count that we they are. When I was in church, I had questions. My grandma and I hold on. This I got a question. They passed me to make it the kingdom hall. I'm not who told you I was the millie star. They told me no question to buy. I'm not going to stop going to the kingdom hall. They'll keep waiting for your praise.",

      "episode": "BONUS Y2K feat. Colette Shade.txt",
      "text": "Greetings everybody. We've got some bonus shopper coming for you today. It's me, Will here today. And on this episode, I will be talking to the author and critic, Collette Shade, about her new book, Why 2K, a collection of essays that examines the phenomenon of millennial nostalgia for the late 90s and early 2000s as it kind of, and examining some of the fissures that sort of the crevices and sort of a darkness that undergirded an era that is mostly remembered now as an area of stupid, good times, good vibes, and endless fun and hope for the future. Collette, welcome to the show. Hey Will, thanks for having me. I haven't been on the pod since I was writing that Pacific standard piece in 2016. Well, there you go. Yeah, there's a little Paila, you know, write a piece about Shapo in 2016 and we'll have you on to talk about your book in 2025. Yeah, well, thanks for that. It's been a long time coming, Collette. So yeah, your book, Why 2K, I really enjoyed it as an as an elder millennial myself. The the year is an era you're talking about is an era that encompasses, like, you know, I'm a little bit older than you, but it's an era that encompasses high school, college, and then like what should have been adulthood for me, but then like the sort of delayed or permanent recession of adulthood in the millennial generation is sort of a theme of this book. But I want to begin by, you talk about the Why 2K era in American culture and like, I mean, and as we talk about it, like, you know, the the features of that era, I think we'll slot into people's minds pretty easily. But like, what is the actual time period we're talking about here? What what what years encompass the Why 2K era as you perceive it? Yeah, so the years that I pick for the purpose of scope for this book are 1997 through 2008. So that is the kind of burgeoning growth of the dot com bubble. Technically, the dot com bubble started in 1995, but I picked 97, because that's when I feel that the excitement and optimism of the dot com bubble started to inform fashion and popular culture. And then the book ends in 2008 with the spectacular meltdown of the entire global economy. So yeah, it begins with an era that was sort of created out of the optimism of both the rise of the internet and the real like coming to the fore of like the computer as probably the most society changing innovation in human culture since the atom bomb. But also a kind of end of history moment for the world, like the the the post collapse of the Soviet Union and the kind of instantiation of like a global democratic liberal hegemony in the world before it all started coming apart, which is also a theme of the book. But I guess in considering this collection of essays, I'll the first thought I had was thinking about the actual Y2K panic. This idea for those who remember it, the idea was that on New Year's Eve 1999 into 2000, like computers would like when it switched over from like 99 to 2000 to 200s, that that would somehow crash the entire global computing infrastructure and then like everything would instantiate essentially a computer-based apocalypse. And I remember when that fear was happening, nobody really took it seriously. I like it seemed dumb and then like in retrospect, it seems even dumber. However, however, Colette, I really do think that the essential myth out that the myth, the idea of Y2K has come true. Computers have destroyed the world and the 21st century has been a horror show. What do you make about like this sort of subconscious yearning in our society or a communication of the idea that like the era of endless hope and bright future was bound to be doomed in early in the 20th century? Yeah, I mean, I think that there was an awareness that this was all too good to last. So like just for some background, the late 90s, the stock market is hitting records. We've got the Dow hitting 10,000 for the first time in its history. Rudy Giuliani who's the mayor of New York City at the time were a little hat that said Dow 10,000 as he rang the closing bell in March 1999. You had an MIT economist in 1998 saying we will never have another recession again. Another guy, George Gilder, who's kind of a conservative, gadfly and policy maker who's still around by the way. He wrote a book, I believe it's called the Israel gene. This is most recent hit. The Israel gene about how I think it's basically like, fornology for why Israel is good and should keep doing what it's doing. But anyway, so this guy, this guy basically said that the, and he said this in the early 90s that the internet would allow us to finally finally overcome those pesky laws of physics that had enslaved humans for all of history. And we would just be able to transcend the brute physical world and essentially have unlimited prosperity, peace and understanding for all. Like the why to K hysteria was perhaps misplaced, but what is did accurately capture a kind of a collective unconsciousness that the good times were soon to end and that they would be ended by this combination of kind of end of history, capital, hegemony, capitalist hegemony and the internet and computing. But when you talk about like this feeling that the good time was would never end, I think like one of the main parts of your book is about sort of decanting and investigating the popular culture of that era. What are some of the ways in which the sort of pop music, television, like whatever you're thinking, but like what are some of the the the ways in which like the pop culture of the late 90s right before 911 in the era of good vibes ended forever. How did that reflect this kind of end of history, endless optimism and good hope? Yeah. So you've got like the fashion suddenly everything becomes silver white like silver eyeshadow and nail polish was the look maybe lean had a campaign for like it was like silver makeup for the new millennium because we're all just going to be wearing silver, I guess. One of the things that I begged my mom for the opening essay of the book talks about how I begged my mom to buy me a silver inflatable chair from Target in 1999 because it was essentially advertised as this is the chair of the future, this is the chair of the new millennium and I was like my god, I I don't want to get left behind. I want to have silver furniture just like everyone else will have in the new millennium and I mean god, there was like body glitter that sort of look that girls and women would wear and then also in terms of I think one of the places you actually see this most is in hip hop and R&B and pop videos so like TLC had a super like multi platinum album called fan mail and the theme of the theme of the album was email on the internet and there and and there's their video for no scrubs they're wearing these silver like futuristic cool sexy spacesuits, they're dancing around on a space station, that was 1999, a couple years before 1997, puff daddy and mace had a song called Mo Money Mo Problems. In the video mace and puff daddy are wearing these amazing like silver like streetwear outfits, bright shiny yellow latex like white just really cool shiny black like really cool looking they're floating around in zero yeah huge element to this video was both there like the bright red sort of like uh coveralls these sort of like the shiny bright red coveralls but it was puffy and mace and they were like they were floating in some sort of zero gravity simulator and it's both the message of the song and the visual images of it is that like literally you're never going to come down that like the world the world is now weightless it's shiny and like the only problems that we have is there's too much goddamn money for everyone yeah there's problems that are coming from the money that the problems are coming from within the money but like this is but but one example and I think the interesting thing is like to look back on it now it's both because of the people making it in terms of Mr. Diddy himself but also like the message there was a real there was a real darkness undergirding all of this that that seemed that was like maybe hard to discern in the moment but looking back on it now what are some of the ways in which this kind of the the pop themism of the late 90s and this kind of like uh weightless fantasy world it created what like we what are some of the ways in which we should have anticipated it like a coming darkness or a darkness that it was communicating and perhaps unconscious well I think the best example of this is the fact that this inflatable chair that I begged my mom for in 1999 until she finally bought it for me popped in about a month so so sitting on a sitting on a balloon was not in fact the chair of the future well it was but not the way that I thought it then turned into a piece of um flaccid cold plastic that wound up in the trash well you know now we live in a the plastic the plastic trash reality we were still waiting for some chair innovations in the 21st century I don't I don't think they've come up with anything better than the old model but hopefully silicon valley will come up with it a new and better chair but yeah like I also talked about like that era when like every mac computer had that like sort of soft bubble with the color plastic on it yeah and I write about that what one thing that I wanted and never got um was a the mac g3 which was designed by jony ive and it was it came out in 1998 the first color was bondy blue because get it bondy beach is a surf spot and you're going to use it to surf the web ah interesting yes and then the next year in 1999 they came out with like I think it was like five colors it was like orange raspberry lime blueberry they're all named after fruits so it you know it was keeping it light and fun and quirky but I think the thing that really sticks about out to me about this design is that you can see inside of the computer so it's almost saying like hey technology is fun it's not scary it's it's round it's soft it's not going to hurt you with angular lines and it's almost you can almost supple and breast like and it's contours like yeah yeah kind of sexy and um yeah and you can see what's going on it definitely is not spying on you you can spy it it's not spying on you and just dragnetting all of your data to sell off to mysterious data brokers in the nsa i mean i should note that the laptop i'm recording this one now is like a a black rectangle like gun metal box uh that's completely impenetrable and it's just like it's just like yeah but like uh in terms of like uh some of the some of the examples of like the pop culture of the era when i think about the 90s like the uh some of what's interesting is that some of the most popular some of the most like long lasting and memorable culture of that era i think about shows like the ex files which you sort of came out of nowhere in that it was so much different than like this dominant mode of sort of like a witness optimism and you know sort of friction this frictionless reality of eternal abundance and optimism but like nonetheless like kind of similar to the way in which like people needed to believe that the world was going to end uh because of the computer is rolling over to zero shows like the ex files like it it captured this this bone deep suspicion that like people weren't really ready to uh communicate uh consciously but like that there is a like i i backed this idea that there's a real darkness underneath all of this that this something is wrong and it would not last yeah and the other thing i want to say is that there were non subconscious signs of this too right so i was born in 1988 um in an inner ring suburb of northern virginia and like four days before i was born and like maybe five or six or eight miles from where i was born james hansen testified for the first time in the capital saying that climate change posed an existential threat to humanity and so throughout the nineties we like knew that climate change was happening and was getting worse and was going to be a big problem but it was of course at the time in the y2k era talked about as a problem of the future or a problem for quote unquote our children's children not like people actually living at the time despite when we actually look back now we can see that some of the disasters that happened whether that was like heat waves and floods in the nineties or like hurricane katrina these were exacerbated by climate change i i i i i i also i mean like they're to return to uh p ditty and mace mo money more problems like it's just it's just a different era of pop music particularly in rap music like the the tone and look of that whole song could not be more out of place with today's like rap and hip-hop music which is like uh if i had to describe it it would mostly be like uh i've taken so many pills i can't feel anything anymore see like that seems to be dominant ethos of today but like what are some other examples of and like i the other thing that's interesting about your book is that like you're not you're not criticizing the pop culture this era you said that you're an unabashed uh like enjoyer of this like i'm critically i love all of it everything basically everything that i write about except for maybe like girls gone wild i would not say i'm a fan i'm not a fan of that no i'm not i mean it was all yeah it was it was just just bosoms i was just bosoms of breasts over and over again well here's the thing if it was just bosoms and breasts i think i'd be more of a fan of it well yeah actually well yeah i talk about like another another stupid awful thing from that era that like at the time was just like oh here's a bit of a uh a ribo bit of a good time but like of what we know now about joe frances this was just like pure pure sexual assault and exploitation yeah pretty much yeah um right i mean like there was uh i talk about there's an essay that i have about sort of sexuality and porn and purity culture and kind of comparing and and contrasting different approaches to sex and sexuality during the 90s and i think that one of the really interesting things will not interesting i i don't know i said it was interesting it's actually horrifying um one of the horrifying things about like say specifically about girls gone wild is that there's been a lot of investigation about how this stuff wasn't just you know in some cases sure it was girls consensually flashing and performing for the camera but in other cases you know girls have said hey i was too drunk to consent you know they ambushed me on the street of norlings while i was um on spring break and blackout drunk and we're like hey sign this paperwork and be on girls gone wild and i was like sure and then i didn't remember it and then my face was in breasts were being used to market this thing and it was just terrible right and and the other thing i want to add is i think that because one of the big things that i talk about is that there was a real uh aversion to any kind of politics during this era whether that was like a socialist or leftist economic politics whether that was an anti racist politics um and certainly feminism like it was an extremely anti feminist time and so people who raised questions about this who were like hey this doesn't seem so good we're sort of seem like oh you're a boar you're you know you're a wet blanket like get out of here and shave your your hairy pussy i don't remember that part of the night yeah you know actually you know what i do remember that this is when this is when brazilians became like yes this is actually when brazilians became a thing so it was like if you were perceived i definitely had someone say something like that to me at one point well i mean like it fits in with like what you're trying to communicate about like the the sort of the dominant communication of sexuality in this era like i think about britney spears and Christina uh yelera and like these highly sexualized sort of like teenage pop stars that we're beginning to borrow heavily from the aesthetics of pornography but it's this mix of purity and degradation and sleeves on like like mixed together and like like what do you make of of the messages of the sort of like female pop music of of that era yeah so actually i do want to draw distinction because Christina aguilera always stood out among the female pop stars because she i don't think to my knowledge ever was like wearing a purity ring or talking about purity and she also seeing um in many ways like more explicitly and confidently about sex and sexuality like come on over baby is literally about like a woman who's horny and wants to have sex and the guy's not sure if he wants to have sex and she's like no it's cool it's it'll be fun um and she's in a bottle got a rubby the right way she's literally saying she's literally saying and then one and then one to get dirty want to get dirty right want to get dirty right like do you need a bottle is literally saying like you're bad at foreplay like here's how you go to it we don't know i think that's a good point i mean i guess i i i threw Christina in there because she was like the other really huge pop stars like this is more on the this is more in line with like Jessica Simpson Jessica Simpson yeah who advertised that she was staying pure until marriage yes right and so here's what was really strange about the marketing at this time is that female pop stars were expected to be like essentially style themselves after porn stars like Jenna jaymason like have like the blonde hair where like super skimpy clothing um be just like waxed and tanned to every inch of them and sing and dance in sexualized ways but then they were in a lot of cases also expected to present kind of a virginal not kind of like a literal virginal uh vibe right like Brittany um she was you know she said for at least a couple years that she was staying a virgin until marriage and this was very much a big part of her image and there was this interview i forget who it was with where she said like she didn't understand why people found her dancing in a schoolgirl mini skirt to be sexual and and right and so it's like what what this says to me is that it's saying like this is all for the purpose of men right because if a woman is like knowingly sexual then she's scary and then she can like i don't know tell you you're doing foreplay badly but if you if she's like essentially sexualized to be almost like a little girl right so there's like this David Lashapel rolling stone shoe and look again i love David Lashapel's work i think he's a great photographer and this was kind of a smart winking nod to this perhaps but like there is a picture of her riding a child's bicycle um wearing shorts that say baby there is a picture of her in bed in like satin laundry holding a tellotubby which is a i remember that photo yes no exactly we all do um it's seared into our elder millennial brains and to me what this is communicating and again i was born in 1988 and so and the book covers from when i was nine in 1997 through when i was 20 in 2008 and so this is like right when i'm hitting puberty like 10 11 12 13 and so the message i'm getting is i have to be a sexy woman but i'm not allowed to like say what i like sexually or be or sexually pursue boy like you have to you have to present yourself in a way that's highly sexualized yes for and informed by the aesthetics of pornography which is which is yeah which is thanks to the internet has become became like more more saturated into people's brains and the culture that i'd ever had before but at the same time you you have to do this while also like portraying this very childlike the we're like the childlike um so it's like you are you are sexual to be consumed by other people but you have the sexuality of your own right no sexuality of your own right which is like pretty creepy well uh uh less creepy is i think one of the one of my favorite chapters in the books is about how you learned about sex through ludicrous song i learned about sex or what's your fantasy and like you know ludicrous is another another rapper of an era like who who songs were very fun goofy they were very like tongue in cheek and they were about like having fun and like good times but like what what was it about this one what's your fantasy your confusion about like you were like you're like i'm aware of what sex is you know like pnv and whatnot but like is everyone doing it on the 50 year line of the jargidome like what's this on on a library on a stack of books how would that even work correct yes yes so this was a big thing it's funny i was talking to someone else at uh i did an event at mcnelli jackson a couple nights ago and someone came up to me and was like oh yeah i had the exact same experience hearing that song where i was like this is a nasty song like yeah right like it's like the funny thing is it's not it's not really that nasty it's actually like if you listen to lyrics that song they're actually like i mean yeah they're they're they're they're dirty but like it's like it's actually like not it's interesting because i talk about like misogyny and rap music which i can get to in a minute but this song is actually like not disrespectful of women this is like hey what are you into tell me what you're into like what's your fantasy what's your fantasy what do you into yeah you're into right but so so how i came into this song i was in seventh grade and one of my best friends calls me up and she's like oh my god have you heard of this song it's so nasty and she tells it to me she tells me about this and so i turn on mtv and i'm like waiting for it to come on and then when it comes on of course i'm shocked because i assume it she describes the video is being nasty and and it's just like him driving around in a car and like dancing in a parking lot with some people i thought it was going to be like porn but but he talks about like he he basically lists every conceivable sexual fantasy right so he says like um we can do it with whipped cream and strawberries and cherries on top we can do whips and chains we can do role playing that's by the way that's no that's nobody's actual sexual fantasy right i know i don't strawberries and cream yeah whipped cream i mean once again it's one of those things that like when you're a kid and like like long before you become sexually active and but you're interested in sex and you want to know what what is this whole undiscovered continent of adult life going to be like and i thought the undiscovered continent of adult life was going to be having sex with whipped cream in the library it's like oh yeah is this sex or working at baskin ravens like what is going on he does talk about food a lot he i think he says chocolate is involved at one point yeah he says chocolate chocolate make it melt but uh i i mean another aspect of the book is like how what was your introduction to the the internet and like and then like the attendant social reality is of sex and like adult life as like you know as teenagers as the generation that sort of became teenagers as the internet blossomed into what it is today like what was your first experience with the internet yeah so the internet first came to my house in 1995 meaning like again what i think is important to note about the millennial cohort is that we basically all remember getting the internet for the first time which as children basically and i think that that's very very interesting because like for older cohorts you know this occurred this change occurred as they were adults for younger cohorts they're just born into it right the internet was already in their houses and not just in their houses but like on their phones um right so in 1995 my mom says hey do you want to go on the internet and i go what's the internet and and she takes me on and she's like you so we go to a search engine you know yahu and she's like what are you interested in i was like zina princess warrior so i type in zina princess warrior and i go to some fan site and it you know it takes two whole minutes for a single picture to load like line by line oh yeah you know if you're and like yes and if you're a horny teenage boy at that era i cannot i cannot underscore to you how how much of like a ceiling was put on your uh uh show you shall be say uh youthful energies by a dial up speed yeah like the youth today do not know do not know what that was like to have to just like watch something blink interview very slowly i remember i remember going to uh a playboy.com and like waiting five minutes for an image to render down to where the nipples were exposed you're like okay go to line by line okay i've seen her earlobe this is gonna get really good in about another four and a half minutes here yeah no i mean so so i specifically remember going you know logging on and then you know it was dial up and so i think another really interesting thing is it wasn't until 2005 that wireless surpassed dial up so there was this real buffer um between internet and non-internet life so you would have to actually say okay i'm logging on see if the phones are free dial up that takes like a minute 60 seconds or so you're online and then oh someone picked up the phone you're offline and it wasn't until 2005 that you had wireless where you could just open up your browser and be on and then it wasn't until 2017 or 2017 i'm sorry 2007 that you had iPhones where now suddenly you can be online on the toilet that was not a possibility before well unless you had a let's get a computer in your bathroom which you know i'm sure some people did but yeah like i talked in the book about how around like 1999 aiam and chat rooms became the place to be my my screen name well what was your screen name uh oh my god this is so torquey oh my god this is the worst question anyone has ever asked me my ayl well screen name was thesias twelve because i was a fan of Greek mythology that's good that's good and i that actually makes a lot of sense to me well i like thesias because unlike crick ulyse like he was sort of uh he was a smaller guy he survived by his wits rather than his is brawn and muscle so very fitting very fitting way to get way to get out of the labyrinth but you know the labyrinth is a good good actually a good metaphor for the internet so i guess i chose wisely yeah i think you did yeah so i was little alien too you also read about your experiences of uh chatting i'm like you know because the internet like sort of previously like to have like like like uh like the boomer generation like the the mass proliferation of the automobile and like cars that was like if you were a teenager and you had access to a car that was your access to social life to sex to a world outside your parents authority and i think for our generation the internet really was that for us creating this virtual space of lawlessness free of adult supervision so like how do you take advantage of that yeah so i write about i write in uh in the essay about sex about how in 2001 when i was in eighth grade i was 13 i went in a chat room and i think it was like a supposedly like a local teens chat room and i was like hey i'm everyone in that chat room is a pedophile well i'm getting to that um don't worry this this doesn't go anywhere too dark but um so i go in and i'm like hey i'm a hot 13-year-old girl are there any hot 13-year-old guys uh thesias 12 was enter the chat yeah uh thesias 12 or whoever he like private iam me and we're chatting and he's like oh what do you look like and so i lied because i basically but i lied in a way where it wasn't like so extreme but i was like oh i have a beacup breast and i'm five five instead of i'm an eight cup and i'm five one i thought well maybe if we meet maybe he just like won't notice or something and then he is like okay cool do you want to like meet and suddenly something started to click in my head and i was like wait wait a second and then he's like where are you from and i said i was from the town that was like two towns next to the town where i was from and then i logged off and a lot locked the computer in a safe and so did reservoir so the like the dividing line here between the end of the 90s and the end of history and the world that we're currently living in now is essentially two events 9-11 and the economic collapse of 2008 first of all collect i got to ask you do you remember where you were when 9-11 happened yeah i watched it live on CNN in my civics class they will they will the tv ends of the class that's well no no actually it's it's crazier than that so our civics class in 8th grade was having a unit on current events and the news so we started off every day for that unit watching um CNN and we turn on the tv and oh she was just supposed to watch a regular CNN that morning yeah and then there's smoke pouring out of the the twin towers and everyone starts freaking out and then the tv and the entire school gets cut that was when frightening well uh actually uh to return to you uh sex and pornography for a second the one the one thing i downloaded in your book that was genuinely jaw dropping to me was that in the famous in the 2004 Paris Hilton sex tape one night in Paris uh you said that you you write that uh the the the the the the the the the the paracelot and sex tape opens with the following in memory of 9-11 2001 we will never forget yeah that's exactly like let's go i to pay collect like collect like i if you wanted to have like like the like the the poll quote the elevator picture of this book that describes what we're talking about here it's the fact that the paracelot and sex tape opens with a 9-11 we will never forget memorial yes and it's also shot in night vision yes which is like which is like the uh like when i remember the rock war basically i mean i i i i never considered that i mean like i i i remember like i saw stills from this paracelot in sex tape but it looked like they were performing dordidor raids in illusion or something like that but like but like but but 9-11 is like the years that followed 9-11 and like the bush war on terror war on arachios you see the like because like it took popular culture a while to catch up to like what the war on terror actually was and i think only now we're sort of like finally having a culture that has caught up to to that era or like it is beginning to communicate or like uh to sort of express the the reality of what that what that was and like have a culture that catches up to it but like in the to in the bush era in the war on terror era we still had a popular culture that was like total request live the p-ditty the the frictionless endless optimism but it had like but it had curdled and it had curdled and it had gotten and it was starting to go off like what are some examples of that well right so basically the classic one is the clear channel memorandum which i think you've talked about on your show uh a couple years ago with Felix so this was an internal memorandum from let's now i heart radio where they were basically like hey guys considering this tragedy we should um maybe not play certain songs and okay maybe but some of these songs were like the entire the entire like discography of rage against the machine because they criticize the united states and it was considered um in appropriate to criticize the united states after 9-11 oh the other thing too is like the the really interesting thing is that the the line that people were saying after 9-11 is well like an immediate aftermath you would get like peace and love and let's all like donate to our local blood bank type of messaging which is great i think that that's positive but but what you really got that what eclipsed it almost immediately was talk about paid being patriotic the only appropriate way to respond to 3,000 people being murdered was to be patriotic to fly your American flag to wear your American flag t-shirt um and absolutely do not can don't even consider um you know critiquing the u.s government because that's unpatriotic oh also go shopping George Bush told us to go shopping uh collette was it was it you who shared that quote from Fred d'Eurst of limpisket when he was asked about uh the warna rack and he was just like yeah shit's it's really crazy like it's times you're living in right now we have no choice we all got to support our country and by the way our album uh uh uh uh girls asshole smelling is out next week please yeah someone no wasn't me but i reposted that and i was like yeah this is pretty much my book that's that's another you know that this is my thesis this is my thesis um i i guess one thing about is that like like i was saying that there was like there was a darkness inherent in the pop culture of the late 90s but like the cruelty that undergirded all of it and like the kind of sadism became more pronounced in the brauntary years where it was still running the same pop culture algorithm but the kind of the nastiness the sadism of it started to come to the the the four i think yeah and it got stupider like we all got stupider this was the era of the swan and flavor of love and rock of love uh colette what like when i think of a film that i think like it was released in the year 2000 but i think like it's very much of a part of like of what is like the high canon of the wide-tuk era i don't think you mentioned it in your book but i feel that i always think about in terms of like how it very funnily and very like accurately press like sort of prophesizes the coming of the 21st century is the film bring it on are you familiar with bring it on oh yeah oh i love bring it on yeah i bring it on is a is a great movie it's very funny but like essentially like i think it captures the the hyper-sexualized teenage culture of the era where like the entire community is essentially behind these girls as they perform their public rituals of boastful cruelty and teen and sort of like titillating teenage sexuality that's kept within the bounds of a very strict like as you were saying like sexuality is for women to display to a proud town and community not to be used by them to have sense for their own reasons yes also the other big part of that movie which is about rival cheerleading squads in southern california another big aspect of that movie is that the popular san diego cheer squad of all white girls are only popular because it's revealed that they stole all of their dances from the the black high school in in in in Los Angeles oh god yeah and this is like what i think that's such a billion read is it too because like there was a lot of sublimated racial angst that came out in really interesting psychoanelitic ways so i have you know and i want to say here that like i talk about when i talk about like rap there were different kind of types of it at the time even within popular culture like i'm not talking about someone like miss yeliot with what i'm about to talk about she's much more like i mean she's also god talk about like creating the look of the future i mean she and like tibalyn were so essential in terms of creating this like it was like an afro futurism of like oh yeah like we're in the 21st century we're going to be able to like transcend and like tibalyn's production sounded so futuristic too it sounded like very like sci-fi almost yeah right exactly it sounds like it's right it sounds like it comes from the future and it's going to give us this wonderful peaceful new new um millennium that we're all excited about but there was another trend within um rap that i talk about and i talk about it specifically in terms of how it was received by many types of white people and this was uh bling era rap the sort of dirty south like you know when new orlands in advance has started to become like the cultural epicenter's like the classic the classic yeah like the classic one is bling bling um by bg featuring big timos but i feel too down i'm a good out my folly a nigger 17 plan with six figures i got some us ice you can stay on the nigger with just the cash money and nobody stay close okay that's from 1999 and basically all these guys there's like a very young little wane in it um there's all these guys are just like hanging out at this mansion they're driving around on speedboats tossing money everywhere flying around in helicopters and driving luxury cars they're nude women are not nude but like women in bikinis dance to the cloud scantily clad thank you well um yeah and it's just sort of this like this celebration of pure wealth and acquisition and what ends up happening is you also have um like someone like jz i think is a good example of this but you have clips you have a lot of other popular um wrappers at the time singing about like a wrapping about like coming up in the drug trade and talking about sort of the nitty gritty of like the violence and the sort of um acquisitive aspects of the drug trade and what i argue with actually with help from a couple academics including lester spence um who has some good stuff on this but basically what i argue is that this was a way for americans to sublimate what was actually happening in our country both in terms of how capitalism was operating at that point in time which was just sort of this low interest easy credit like low interest yes and it like yeah and that yeah like yeah like the rap music like shifted from a kind of an almost like a document documentary style i for like the stories of the been formed by the lives of people who lived a criminal lifestyle into sort of an evolution of that where it became and and i remember not liking this music at the time which was a huge oversight on my because i love all of it now i love all of it now too but like yeah like to me at the time it just struck me as like a purely nihilistic expression of just like having money for no other reason then but also violence like oftentimes these not always but oftentimes these songs will talk about um you know the violence that's required to obtain and and keep the money which really is not so different um from the violence that's required to obtain and keep money in any other sector of society it's just that this is you know a little bit more kind of maligned yeah like the other thing is uh there's there's a lot of military imagery and hip hop at the time yeah no limit soldiers no limit soldiers with the tank with the tank uh comes onto the basketball court and shoots a missile into the back four and then that was a great video come up we have to go we have to go back we have to go back we have to return i know i know i know i know i know we have to return to tradition i know but but i can't talk about tia i'm pleased yeah yeah so um so tia has a song where he compares himself to the Taliban he says that he's wild as the Taliban nine in my right 45 in my other hand i'll never forget uh uh we're we're driving in california cathana nine and she had never heard the the jazzy and diplomat song welcome to new york city yes and the line in that where juhal santana in the chorus says we from home in 9-11 the principal lost hours we still banging and she he was just so like like perplexed and like i mean she's found it like it was it was so she was overjoyed to have a song of that era where rappers were immediately appropriating 9-11 is like the coolest thing and like that's why i think that's why new york still matters is just people flew planes into our buildings it wasn't new war lives here at land it was in land it was fucking new york where it happened yeah yeah air point uh but collette like during the same period during the same y-2k period is is the exact era in american popular culture that saw the rise of rap music from being a genre into being the dominant pop music form and the and conversely the complete supplanting of rock and roll yes as like as an american pop culture product because like unfortunately i have to i hate to say in today's world rock and roll is dead what do you think accounts for that and and why do you think like rap music was so perfect to as a vehicle to sort of communicate and anticipate like these trends you're talking about yeah i mean so there are a couple of people whose work i talk about like i talk about lester spence who writes about like how rap music essentially or not all rap music but like a lot of this type of rap music we're talking about essentially expresses like neoliberal ideas about personal responsibility and you know getting rich and all of this and then um i get richer die trying i was in the the foundational album foundational album of the of this era and also um yeah like there's there's a section in that essay where i compare uh some clips lyrics to some statements by bill clinton when he passed the welfare reform act do you remember which clips lyrics yeah they said uh put it on your what did they say uh put it on the scale help your god damn self get it how we live it we don't ask for help i mean like a lot of clips lyrics also reflect uh what was going on in the Arkansas airport when bill clinton was governor yeah right moving a lot of snow in and out yeah yeah but like what but like uh like for rock music is like you know in the in the 80s and like in the early 90s before the why two care why two k era was like the last gasp of rock and roll in grunge in the grunge genre because like i remember well you did have i mean nirvana allyson shanes and purljane like that was the that was the first music that i listened to that was like my music it wasn't just like my parents are like oh like this is the Beatles this is what we listen to there's the music of our generation that i like but like the grunge era was really like that was music for me as i came into adolescence the the prevailing message of grunge was like that kind of it was the same kind of genx nihilism but it was a real anger and depression about the world although it's interesting because i do feel like rap at this this point like you're talking about earlier like a lot of rap is kind of back rap is almost like the vibe of grunge now it's like oh i'm really addicted to drugs and i want to die yeah and like i don't know like i and like also the rap music of that era like you know from me one of the most foundational songs of my youth is wootain clenched cream cash rules everything around me yeah cash rules everything around me right however but like it was a little before but like and you can tell that it is right on the cusp of that era because like you think about it like cash rules everything around me sounds very much in line with the get richer die trying or sort of like bling bling or of the early 2000s but the actual lyrics of that song are intensely depressing and they're basically about like just the about poverty makes you insane yes exactly right and the other thing i wanted to mention is i talk a lot about how like there really wasn't so throughout the 80s and 90s the reaction to the neoliberal turn which i know i have to define on a lot of interviews i do but i know here hopefully not uhum but like the the reaction to the neoliberal turn and sort of like this growing inequality um racialized in a lot of cases was essentially just let's lock up a bunch of mostly black people in destroyed urban centers like as you remove manufacturing as as american industrialized as yeah the industrialization right what are you going to do with all these people that like no one has a place in the economy yeah right and so essentially like throughout the 80s and 90s you had the growth of these surplus populations and through the white 2k era um it's just that there was this discourse during the late 90s and early 2000s that well you know the tide is rising and it's lifting all boats but it's not we're just like walking up the people who aren't um rising with the tide basically and i think that like the way that this could be processed was through kind of mass mass popularity of particular styles of rat music because it did give you glimpses into this stuff but it sort of let you compartmentalize it in a sense now like it's returned to the question of rock and roll what was it like what was it about rock and roll that didn't that that that was like out of place with the white 2k era but i mean like because like you know like and this like rock and roll had a brief moment coming back with the rap rock rap hybrid rap rock but like what was it about like and then like the kind of indie rock boom live with the strokes which is you know harking back to like an earlier era like develop an underground and then the stooge is but like what was it about rock music and that made it insufficient or like no longer was relevant to like the white 2k era what do you think what do you think that was that's it that's an interesting question and no one's asked me that one yet i mean so the what i'm saying i think was that there was there's a book uh called why why white kids listen to rap from 2005 by a former editor in chief of the source and he basically argues uh bacari kidwana he basically argues that after Kurt Cobain died there's just this this sort of void in terms of he was like the voice of that generation and after he died in 1994 it kind of it caused grunge to kind of peter out and then um rap which had already been you know growing throughout the 80s and 90s was able to kind of fill this void of youth rebellion um right you know at around that time you had like the height of the careers of big in two-pock and then of course you know their debts very shortly after and so like it was almost like i mean the way he argues it and he also does have a sort of um a similar read to what what i was just saying about like the industrialization and all of this but um yeah he basically argues that it was it was sort of contingent it was just like well there's a hole in the marketplace and this is an interesting form of music and interesting innovative stuff is happening here and rocks feeling sort of stale and so here we go and and it just sort of steps in and then it becomes the dominant kind of voice of youth rebellion and kind and displaces displaces rock basically and it's interesting because like we're we're living in the world now in 2025 where rock has been displaced but i'm wondering if you noticed the interesting thing now is that country music is becoming mainstream in a way that it has never been in american culture because if you look at guys like you know post malone who was doing like who's a white guy doing like rap or in b stuff five six years ago he's putting out a country album now like he's leaning heavy into wearing cowboy boots and a fucking tin gallon hats everywhere with the face tattoos and everything but like yeah what we make of this like the the rise of country music now like fitting into into this current perhaps more right wing era that we're living in that yeah i don't know i mean i wonder though if it is necessarily more right wing i mean i don't know we're definitely in a more right wing era like i've gotten asked about this a couple times elsewhere and i basically feel like in some ways we're sort of going back to the sort of like reactionary nihilist anti-politics of the white uk era these days but i also think it's different because the reason things are so reactionary and so anti-political in those days is because people generationally had not experienced things like the war the you know decade-long war global war and terror they had not you know lived with or continued to live with the effects of the great recession and so they're like these they're these generational events that shape cohort that shape politics at a cohort level and so you kind of can't say oh we're just totally redoing it because conditions are different but yeah i don't know i mean i sort of feel like and maybe this is just boring and not um i have to think on this more but my my kind of got reaction as just that there's an opening in the marketplace again like people are i don't think people are like done with rap but they're like in the same way that they were sort of seemingly done with rock in the 90s but it is there is sort of a hunger for something different and i think just countries there and it's starting to you know filled avoid um i mean like i again like this is this is just speculation on my purpose like i don't know if it accounts for it but like i i guess what i would i would have what if what is interesting to me about country music as a genre as compared to rap music is that the content of country music song essentially the life of the goals that it is advertising to its listeners are essentially so much more attainable like the world the world the world that country music describes is a world that is a world of and i'm not saying and i'm not saying this as a criticism of country music at all but it is a world that is predictable it's a world that is knowable and that it is small and containable in your own life you fit into it and the content of what is going to happen to you next day tomorrow is somewhat similar to what happened to you today and like the touchstones of like your town your community the people in it are knowable and legible and that like that that every day normal people like like you know like Friday night you're going down you're gonna like you're gonna two step you're gonna have a shot of jack Daniels you're gonna drink you're gonna dance you're gonna drive home you're gonna listen to the radio you're gonna have some peers with your friends but like this is not a world of unimaginable wealth or like unimaginable nihilism and contempt for being alive right i think that and i think that that's a good thing and the other thing to remember to about country music is that even though it had this right wing turn basically and well actually especially after like i would say like sort of during the 90s but not even like particularly post 9-11 um Toby Keith will put a boot yeah we'll put a boot your ass it's the American way but he fair it is another song well that song does slap so i mean i gotta say i do i did like i did like all those those jingoistic Toby Keith so it goes this song perhaps ironically and then perhaps unironically who knows at this point he's also he's also to be fair he's like like here's the thing i don't endorse putting a boot in anyone's ass but i do think that i do i do think that it's a fair description of american foreign policy yeah that's true well uh i'll just remember uh r.a.p. chris christopherson who said of Toby Keith guys like him did the country music with pantyhose did the finger fucking yes exactly right chris was like chris was like uh you know like a comrade like i think that um i think it's important to to remember like i was gonna say it was country music that it was not always right wing and in fact for the majority of its its history it was a not always right wing and in fact not even white well i mean one of the biggest country artists now is shabuzy is black guy yeah and then yeah and Beyonce do is doing her country album and what she's you know made very plain in in interviews is and things and is just saying that she's like reclaiming it right she's reclaiming country um or i don't know if interviews i know she doesn't really like do interviews but whatever she's made plain that essentially she is is um reclaiming like a black a specifically black lineage of country music that's kind of been um marketed out of it uh just think about like the politics of country music and chris christartras and i've ever seen like people people shared this clip when he died but like it was an interview that he did with the highwayman the uh the sort of country music super group with like him wail and jennings uh johnny cash and uh willy nelson and like the interview was asking like you know like uh what do you feel like how do you feel about americans society today and chris chrisartras and goes basically says like well we've got a government and a media that's not too different than nazi germany but other than that i think we're doing fine i think that was from 1991 too so he got it he got it yeah uh colette i i i have a great time talking to you and remembering of the these cultural touchstones that have uh ordered both you're in my lives but i guess like uh the the the last year i want to discuss with you is like this this is a book very much about nostalgia it's about your own uh personal like memories and reflections on your life and like how these things connect to these like larger shifts in political economy and and culture but like obviously now in 2025 i've been like i don't know how you feel but i i feel like i'm speaking for a lot of people where it really seems like it's never been worse than it is now and it's not getting better and it's really it's like the dominant thing is that it's only going to get worse so understandably people retreat more into the past and then and then nostalgia becomes a thing that becomes sort of like a i don't know like an anesthetic for living in a present of which there doesn't seem to be a future i mean that's why i wrote this book right like the inspiration for this book like in 2018 i was like more depressed than i've ever been in my entire life um i mean things seem like actually worse now but just things in my personal life are a little better so that kind of makes it more colorable but um but yeah like i found this letter from 1999 from this time capsule where i was like oh and the in the new millennium i will attend Stanford University and your time capsule letter was hilarious you really called you really called it you really got a lot of you you got a lot of the right i mean something's wrong but i think the broad strokes you got you got correct yeah we definitely started to quote unquote do something about our environment but i guess what i'm saying is like i don't i don't think i think nostalgia is like a natural human tendency and like i think there there is something distinctly pleasurable about it like and but like we live in a world that we live in a pop culture now that just seems to be only nostalgic and i guess like do you have an idea about like when nostalgia stops being a wholesome or like reverential or when when the style like at what point free does nostalgia become a problem or become something bad yeah so yeah like i was saying i i was super into nostalgia in i mean i still am but i was like obsessively following these nostalgia white to can nostalgia instagram accounts and like only listening to music that i listened to in middle school during like you know 2018 or just like one of the worst years of my life um to to get away and to just like you said like have a reprieve from the present and um one of the things i wanted to do in this book was not only explore the nostalgia specifically but to explore what nostalgia means and yeah i basically think it becomes a problem when you retreat so fully into it that you basically say well there's nothing we can do um everything was better in the past oh well and i guess i got another print your book is that like it really wasn't better and it wasn't really better in the past all these same problems were there and only it only looks better or like it only feels better to us because we were all like you know not adults then or not living in this not having to live but that's part of it but also like what i'm saying is like to me i see it i see it as this analogy right so like it would be like saying that it would be like me saying like oh um my my inflatable chair was really well made before i sat on it and it popped because it was constructed shittily and you know yeah or like i mean i i i think about like uh you know we made fun of them on this show quite a bit but like the sort of like right wing uh sort of like engagement forming accounts where they're like they've become nostalgic for like the 1994 yeah and until like you know just sort of like an era in which like you know we were all alive and but it was just sort of like the window for what you can be nostalgic about is getting shorter and shorter and shorter and i think in like about five years time there's going to be this there's going to be nostalgic accounts for like January 2025 and we'll all remember like yeah well i'll remember like how things look differently but the i think the problem is now is like the like if you get with the last 20 years or so like there hasn't been any of these big noticeable shifts in like the way people dress or the what things look like it really just feels like we are living in in a ever ever expanding horizon of this kind of like of nostalgia of of a past that like never really stopped but like with which there is less and less juice to be squeezed out of yeah i mean it's the mark fisher thing right like we're all just stuck in this capitalist realist world where because we're trapped in this political economy that is like causing Los Angeles to burn and like causing you on musk to become like to facto god emperor like we just feel like there's nothing yeah we just all feel trapped and it's not like i have any like special sauce for how how we get out of this but i think that it's a reaction to this sense that like there's there's nothing that we can do and i also trace this there's nothing we can do idea to like the late 90s neoliberal turn because it was like hey look at how great it is there's nothing we can do and now it's like wow we live in hell there's nothing we can do i mean but they're actually i mean i don't know i don't i'm not like a solutions person unfortunately but i mean i ultimately believe that if there was some kind of like forward looking left project that was focused on like essentially like increasing union power and like regulating fossil fuels and other you know dangerous how do i know how how will most people like live in the coming century is that i'm going to make it easier for them or harder for them right no exactly we need to have there needs to be some kind of project that is forward looking that says hey here's a radically different idea we've we've had the like like one of the things i talk about so i've an essay in there about california because i i spent a lot of time in the bay areas a kid because i family there actually who was was participating in the dot com bubble i write about like you say that like it was like they think they were like uh did the holocaust or something they i'm a fan unfortunately from several film members who participated in the dot com bubble well yeah um i mean they fell out of a guard tower at google catch dot com honestly it actually wasn't like and i'm not just saying this as as like defending my own family but but actually it was like it was it was a communications company in the late 90s so it wasn't like it was like hey this is decent you know this is like this is like at least this is something that sort of socially has some kind of social value um versus whatever the hell is going on there now um but like i talk about california and the two visions of the future that it can offer so the future that i saw in california when i was a kid when i wanted to go to Stanford university like this family member had um and like all of my idols did like Chelsea Clinton i love Chelsea Clinton as a kid uh she was the first kid she's the first kid yeah yeah and um you know but i talk about i talk about california seemed like it would bring us this wonderful future future full of transparent computers and this wonderful peaceful internet and eternal pros and endless prosperity for all and then what it actually brought us was like tech oligarchy self-driving cars that crash into each other and giant wildfires uh yeah and and like AI uh AI prompt bars that will be like oh uh show me a picture of uh Tony soprano riding a horse or you know into uh i don't know into a ball pit at chucky shees uh yeah the the creation of that image required 10 million gallons of fresh water to produce right right right but at what i talk about um you know and also god speaking of like stuff you know predictions of the future um i had this experience when i was 10 or i'm walking around San Francisco with my uncle and i wandered off and this homeless guy starts screaming at me and i'm like what the hell is going on because i'm like from the suburbs of dc and didn't have a lot of experience with that sort of thing and at the time you know um i was just like well that was weird and now i kind of look back and he almost is like the ghost of of the future in a way because it's like this is what's the problem this is going to be a massive problem in the 21st century right so you have yes you have like you have sort of the utopian california you have the dystopian california but basically um the problem with the utopian california is it created the dystopian california it's in a lot of ways right and and so what i would like to see is a forward looking project um that gives us that like gives us a vision of the future that's like hopeful and livable and like makes people excited about like being alive and it just doesn't feel like we have that right now uh no it does not but um uh to quote another wucheng song can it be that it was also simple then can it be and the answer is no it was never also simple uh i think we should leave it there collect shade uh thanks for joining us and the book is white uk we will have uh links in the episode description make it so good i don't want to leave you but i got a list list list what's your brand of",

      "text": "Hey dudes, Amber really frost here. I don't know if you've ever heard of me, but for a while I was a co-host on Chopbo Trapp house. Possibly the least favorite one. But I wrote a book finally that is coming out December 5th. And if you like many people cannot read anything longer than like a post, I have good news for you too. I recorded the audiobook. I did it with my own voice, which authors don't usually do because our voices are terrible sounding. But they thought, hey, you have a recognizable terrible sounding voice and I cannot argue with that. So I can't promise you that I'm the best reader of an audiobook. But I can promise you that I was the most stoned reader. I mean, I would bet dollars to donuts. And I'm talking like edibles. I did not want to know how I sounded. It was a lot of pressure. I think it turned out great based on what other people are telling me. So I know you guys like content, right? So think of this as a really long episode of Chopbo, like read by your least favorite host, stoned out of her gourd. I think you will like the book. If you don't, I will not hear about it. But it will at least be interesting. And hey, you know what, worst case scenario, the book does well. It pisses off a bunch of people you don't like. And sometimes spite is all we have in this world. So yeah, wherever you get books, get that book, uh, it's called dirt bag. Yes, it's. And yeah, I really appreciate it. Thanks for being patient while I went on a spirit journey. All right. Thanks. Bye. Friends, it's your shop. It's Monday, November 13th. We are back at you again. Felix and I are joined today by Amber Frost. Amber, how you doing? I'm doing good. Um, LA caught on fire recently. Uh, if you read about that, LA's on fire right now. I mean, like there's just like a road. Oh, I saw a guy saving pigeons on an LA freeway on. Oh, that's so sweet. Yeah, they were like they, they fell down. They got the smoke inhalation. And he was just grabbing him up. But I mean, I think he could be hoarding them to use as, you know, careers or something. I don't know. All right. Um, to kick off today's show, I would like to discuss two news items that I neglected to mention on last week's show. One of them has a news hook that just happened today. Uh, the first of which is, uh, let's go with the more contemporary story. Tim Scott dropped out of the Republican presidential race. Uh, and this was only after finally revealing who his girlfriend is. So he's now out of the race to spend more time with his girlfriend, whose name is Mindy Knows, an interior decorator from South Carolina. He, he said he dropped out to like combat anti-Semitism on college campuses. You know, he says here, um, got said some rivals wanted to draw attention to his marital status to sow the seeds of doubt about his campaign, according to the Washington Post. It's like a different form of discrimination or bias. Got said, you can't just say I'm black because that would be terrible. So you find something else that you can attack. Yeah. Everyone remembers that awful chapter of American history when police unleashed fire hoses on guys who didn't have girlfriends. But no, he like, he really did say that he, he's like, all right, silly season's over. I know I'm not getting this president shit because I had saxophonous 37 and no other time in my life. But the real mission starts today combating anti-Semitism at Columbia. Like that's like, you know, how like whenever like a politician loses and they're like, I didn't, we didn't actually lose tonight because the fight begins to blah, blah, blah. He really means he's really like, um, he's really going to go to college campuses and make speeches. I know I applaud Senator Scott for joining the war on college. Yeah, I mean, we can agree on that at least. But is he just like, I don't know, hanging out on the quad or whatever, just like waiting for people to walk by? Like I don't know if like a lot of people are going to host him. I mean, I don't think I think he's like given up on college as an idea, you know, the place where you get laid. Like he's tried that. Right. I think this is a way for him to get invited on birthright. Well, I just want some Mediterranean vacation. Yeah, exactly. I'd like to hear what Mindy knows thinks about him going on birthright. I mean, I mean, it could shield out, do a tent. And also Mindy knows, uh, like, I mean, I'm going to need a follow up on their relationship like six months from now. That's all I'm saying. Mm-hmm. Wow. Mindy knows, uh, looks like one of those women on TikTok who like makes, you know, spaghetti, oh, casserole, like all those disgusting viral meals, like making cool aid in the toilet and stuff like that. Yeah. Did you put it in the chat because I'm only coming up with like, uh, Mindy Collins got a nose job. That would be funny if he were wrong. And he's actually dating Mindy calling. That's the the Cory Booker move for the Republican party. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I am sending you Mindy knows. I do like the idea though that, um, sink like, uh, like bachelors are being discriminated against. And like, and I'm thinking back to like, uh, I feel like she brought up the civil rights movement when, you know, uh, like, people protestors to being attacked. I'm imagining men with like, you know, the placards that they had in the civil rights movement that say that said, I am a man. I'm just imagining now when it says I am a single man. Yeah. I, yeah. I, um, I don't know. Like, uh, best of luck to Senator Scott in the future. Mindy knows is like, like, I don't even know what she thought she was going to get out of this, but she's just pretty hot. I mean, she's also like a, uh, a mother three, but I do kind of wonder if like, he does have a little sense of like it being like discrimination and like, you know, if that's the case, he picked the wrong party. Maybe he is avoiding, avoiding, uh, raising those alarms. Oh, man, think how fucking racist you would have to be to be a Republican and be like, I'm afraid of the virile savage Tim Scott fucking or fucking doing further than nation shit to us. Like that's it. Like if you're terrified of Tim Scott, you were just, you're like medically racist. There's no help for you. No amount of ebriam candy books who are gonna do anything for you. Um, so yeah, she is pretty, she looks pretty good. I do wonder about that. Like, she has three kids, um, what kind of conversation is that to have with your kids where you're like, all right, you may have a new stepfather. I'm his second girlfriend ever. Your stepfather is a, like a 63 year old who's never jacked off. Well, uh, Emory, I mean, you asked like what, what Mindy got out of this? And I think the answer of the question is a trip to the third Republican presidential debate, which he appeared on stage with Tim Scott at the closing of the proceedings. Yeah, she was certainly walking better in heels than Ron DeSantis was. Yeah, I mean, everyone's gonna want her to decorate their weird North Carolina house or whatever the fuck she's from. I mean, it's a bummer because I was hoping, I mean, I was hoping Tim Scott could, you know, finally get, finally get some action. But, you know, unfortunately getting laid is, you know, uh, something you have to do to get become president. And, unfortunately, that's not going to be him. Mike Pence also dropped out. There was an article about how he couldn't get even 15 people to show up to the, uh, the pizza ranch in Ohio to come here and talk. I thought that was the Indian. Mike Pence will also be exiting the Republican primary. I thought that was Indian. Sorry. Yeah. But it was also like, okay, it was like a 7,000 people town in the Midwest. The pizza's not good. Like, they're not like, you know, we don't like that food either. We just were alcoholics and like, you know, Schlitz is the best sauce. They're not going to like eat there during the daytime. That's a, that's a late night sadness meal. Any, any meal where you have to listen to Mike Pence talk is a, is a sadness meal. True. Uh, the next story that I neglected to mention last week is one that concerns, um, the new Republican speaker of the house, um, Mike Johnson headline. Mike Johnson admits he and his son monitor each other's porn intake and resurfaced video. What do they mean monitor? I mean, presumably they're gooning together. Keep gooning, dad. Don't come yet. I mean, I think a system system like that of mutual accountability is great because whether it's working out or gooning, you know, I know I couldn't, like, I couldn't bring myself to stop jacking off if my son was still going. Yeah. And you know, and during an eight hour gooning session, you're going to want to check in with your dad. Uh, this is how this is how they monitor it, Amber. It says, uh, during a conversation on the war on technology at Benton, Louisiana's Cyprus Baptist Church unearthed by Twitter user receipt maven last week, the Louisiana representative talked about how we installed accountability software called covenant eyes on his device in order to abstain from internet porn and other unsavory websites. Quote, it scans all the activity on your phone on your devices, your laptop, what have you? We do it all. We do all of it. Johnson told the panel about the app. It sends a report to your accountability partner. My accountability partner right now is Jack, my son, he's 17. So he and I get a report about all the things that are on our phones, all our devices once a week. If anything, objectionable comes up, your accountability partner gets an immediate notice. I'm proud to tell you my son has got a clean slate. Now you'll notice he doesn't mention that he had a clean slate. Yeah, yeah. I mean, yeah, do as I say, not as I do. His son's phone is blowing up with like 30 slack notifications, you know, like that buzzing noise. It's just like your dad just watched Gianna Michaels big naturals volume 12. Yeah. Oh man. His poor son is trying to like, is trying to like try out for the JV football team and his photos just exploding. Your dad has been watching Fuk team five for the last five hours. I'm also like, you name your kid Jack that's setting him up for failure. That's nomative determinism. I mean, I just like monitoring a father, just like father and son masturbation monitoring is one of the weirder, one of the weirder things and like, okay, if you want to think if the as as a dad as a parent, you're like, I'm I want to enforce a no pornography on on my son's phone or you want to enforce that rule in your household as best you can. But the idea that you have to enlist your son to back you up. Right. You're the you're the god damn potter's familiar. So if you want to watch, if you want to watch Lisa and then go for it, dude, why are you? Why do you need to enlist your teenage son in this? How old is he? The son is 17 years old. Oh, that's way best that, yeah. I mean, really just like any age. That's just that's not part of the son contract, like helping your dad not jack off. Yeah. I don't know. I just feel like I feel like the older it is, the worse it is because it becomes less about parental monitoring. So like, you know, your son doesn't develop a fetish for women vomiting on dicks. But like 17 is like he's of a age where having sex could actually happen. And that's when you really got a, but because when you really got a hard back out. Yeah. Yeah. And it's like, do you think it's like an AA sponsor type thing where you get to call with when you have when you wrap you get the whole right? Yeah. Right. Yeah. Like the son is with a girl or something and he's like showing her like his favorite chain smoker song or whatever. And like they're making out on, you know, make out lane, which I presume they still have for my kids and lives. That's the, that's the Biden infrastructure bill is to make more make out points. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He's on the build back better make out lane. And he's like, he's about to get the third base and then he gets a frantic call from his dad. He's like, son, I'm chipping. I'm, I had my hand on my sweatpants for the last hour. I for it started off, it started off with the victorious secret launch, a model bowl. Now, yeah. Now, now I'm watching like, uh, Andrew Tates, Camgirl Slaves. I got to like go to a meeting, but I'm like really tired right now. Yeah. Yeah. I feel like that's so much like his son's getting bothered with this shit. Like, uh, accountability alert. Your father just just watched a desperate college student. He really needs an A. But like he's he's he's on the bill. He's at the build back better make out lane. This end job brought to you by Joe Biden. Thanks a lot. Thanks Joe. He's getting real pussy and then his dad's annoying him with this accountability bullshit. Well, I don't know. It's also bad if you're just like, I don't know like in trig class or whatever the fuck he's in. Like is it better or worse to because I'm putting, you know what? I think a gentleman puts his phone on silent when you're at make out point. I think that's good etiquette. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, even if you work getting horny dad alerts, it's good etiquette. I just like think about if he like has a bully at school. That's like my that's like, oh, it's like this kid has a bully at school. It's probably a girl like me in high school and and it's ruthless. That is like an anxiety dream. Like, oh my god, your bully is like bullying you and you have your you have your phone out, even though you should know better, the kind of the kinds of alerts that you get on your phone. It's calling you a gay wadden shirt. They probably don't say gay wad anymore. It's probably something. I don't think so, but it is definitely like a five foot three girl like me in like Doc Martin's calling you a father fucker. Well, she doesn't she doesn't even know that yet. Like she's just bullying him for being like, you know, rod without a Todd and then suddenly she sees a huge banner notification on the phone where it's like your dad speaker of the house, Mike Johnson has ejaculated four times today. Oh, that would have been fucking Christmas day for me. Oh my god. I'm now imagine like, you know, you're in a gooning session. You're scrolling around through websites. You're getting increasingly talked up looking at weirder and weirder shit and then you get a pop up and it's Mike Johnson's face and it goes it says new speaker of the house does not want that deal. They only want to come. Please can you help him? You get to watch his trajectory. Yeah, that's that's a good point is like it starts out Lisa and then it ends up like Rayl Black doing real a hand tie. It's just like it's like he's got into the visual like like the two born like the the egg and pregnant stuff because it is it's I think for men it's a slippery slope. Eventually they just they glaze over and they're like, you know what? This doesn't do it regular sex doesn't do it for me anymore. I'm going I'm going straight to to animation. I'm doing I'm going like he's probably it doesn't count for like deviant does it count with like you know you see like all of the Steven universe people fucking each other like it's going to like there's porn is to be found in many mediums these days. That is true. Yeah and I imagine especially like younger people are getting into a lot of the animated stuff. I just like with the app itself I'm wondering like how who created this in the first place and I'm starting to think it was like a stepdad who was like grooming his 13-year-old steps on and the mom like walked in on him like showing the steps on porn and he's like, ah oh uh uh this is part of the mutual accountability exercise. I'm actually making an app about about this. I mean the apps the app the name of the app is like short eyes. Is co-covenant's eyes. It's not too far off. God yeah. No. Yeah. Or you know what? Oh wait wait maybe it's the other direction. Maybe it's like the strange thing about the Johnson's. Wait what's that? What's that? Oh my god. It's you know what? Okay. Early days of come town. That's that's your hint. It's dad fucking like what if it's like a reverse thing. Oh yeah. Oh okay. What if the kid is the aggressor? We don't know the power dynamics in this relationship. Oh my god. What if the dad is the as the unwilling bottom? Oh my god. Could you imagine if that's like yeah that's like his Gary Hart moment that he got like aggressively seduced by his son. The mom is just in the other room doing dishes crying being like it's fine. It's fine. It's fine because she's got to know right? Yeah. Yeah. You can mom's know everything. Like think. Rada. Rada. McDaniel. Rada. Rada. Fucking stupid name. Rada. Romney. McDaniel. I love that. I love that so much. I love that it's like the most Mormon-esque name in the world. Like like they love doing that where they're like yeah my my dad's name was David so my name is David Edda. They're the most like Erzatz religion. But she's kind of like a trailblazer too though like because like she's bucking the stick like everyone thinks everyone thinks that all Mormons are hot and like there she is bucking the stereotype. Hard. Yeah. A stereotype. Yeah. Yeah. She has more of like a Sarah Huckabee look but like she has to go on TV and be like look Mike Johnson's a victim here. I know how this is. But photo of Mike Johnson and son emerges on Johnson's yacht Gooning Business. Gooning. G-O-O-N-I-N-G. It means basically being transfixed with porn, video porn for like 24 48 hours straight. Straits the right word there. All right well to move on from the Master Breitori habits of the current speaker of the house and his family. I'd like to move on to Donald Trump for a little bit and Chris could we could we queue up that clip because I just want to talk about like Trump. He's been saying some very provocative things lately but he's also been saying the very true things lately and I just want to pull up this clip. So about Trump talking about a certain world historical figure that I think will be of some interest to our listeners. And we're becoming a drug haven. You know China many years ago was being taken over by much smaller countries because they were all drugged out on the poppy fields, the poppy the drugs heroin, different drugs but they were all drugged out that nation was drugged out and then along came a very powerful leader you know who that is and he said no more and from that time pretty much until now they they've been strong but they were all drugged out and they were I mean our nations becoming okay our nations becoming that way you look at our nation is that you almost say how does it survive when so many people are absolutely sick from drugs and drug overdoses and all of the things to go with it. Well that is Trump is correct that this country is suffering from an epidemic of drug addiction but he is even more correct that we need a strong leader like Comrade Mao Zedong to basically defeat all of the counter revolutionary revisionism that's been going on in this country sparrows have been running riot over this nation for a long time now and I think it's time we need to I like no more no more no more no more no more parties it does speak to his like pattern of like he just he doesn't have any like ideological leanings he just wants to both with the Israel Palestine thing he's waiting out he wants to see who wins he likes this strong man it is you know the content is completely relevant but I have to say one person pointed out that like the phrase drugged out the last time he heard it was the juicy J song and so like we're kind of wondering if he's into like early 2010s rap folks well folks they're saying they're saying we're gonna folks should I do it I shouldn't they say shouldn't do it but yes we're gonna do it we're gonna run a train folks we're running a train he um he was very generous to the audience being like you know who Mao is like the audience think he was talking about Hitler or something I'm not gonna I'm not gonna insult your intelligence they know he wasn't talking about Hitler because the main thing about Hitler you know speedhead speedhead you don't get those speeches you're not you're not doing as much Adderall as a as a New York girl in publishing that's what happens that those bitches are gonna take over Poland any day now did you see the I think it was from the same speech he said that like he was talking about uh J again and he said he's straight out of central casting central and central crews central casting for what like a 68 year old Chinese man there aren't that many parts for in central casting there's basically one actor in Hollywood who plays above 50 Chinese men yeah I I do like the idea of like him trying to do the cultural revolution but with like only 60 plus year olds yeah he doesn't have a useful cadre yeah and like really Queenie really Queenie like 65 and he is a taste maker like I really bet that like he got a lot of like midwestern dads who sells skiddoos to to watch sunset Boulevard you know in many ways he's he's like he's doing more than PBS for the culture right now Felix I'm loving the idea of a mega cultural revolution where grandparents attack their grandkids and put iron donts caps on them and make them walk to parade them through the villages on the golf carts or whatever yeah yeah yeah no yeah it's all like self criticism and ostriches is a should for reactionary grandkids who don't call their grandparents enough yeah I mean like Billy O'piety would be a good thing to run on like he's he's attracting the elderly they they just want their grandparents they just want their grandkids to call him you know I think we figured out those are the only people that vote it's a good strategy yeah well well you're you're telling me this for the first time I'm hearing this for the first time a people's army will never be defeated never be to be not even once not gonna happen I did I I liked um the stuff he said about uh israel and palestines because that was more that was more even handed than just about any media figure discussing this recent uh the hatred that Palestinians have for Israelis is a hatred like no other and also the other way from israeli's threats Palestinians it's it's good he's touching his bets it's both sides he's he just wants just he's like I'm gonna see how this shakes out he said and it's probably the other way I mean we'll see like maybe he's like Noah Smith and he's finding out about all this for the first time he uh did I think he's the only American politician who has pointed out that Israel is eating shit on the PR front yeah and I mean it's very he's the only person who's like it's bad optics and it's like that is the weird thing that like Felix and I have talked about that it's like they're still very delusional in that they think that like and and it's our fault too and some degree like into some degree the UK it's like we have spent so much time being the Gretchen winners to their Regina George that like of course they think they're delicious of course they think they're they're beloved they're like living in a bubble where just they have they think that uh any criticism of them is like an insane minority opinion and like they do not see that like the tides are turning it's the weirdest thing I think being able to talk about this too like it sounds like we thought we'd see in our lifetime no not at all and like most politicians right like you know not all of them are as like literally due to mental disability trapped in the past as Yobitan is but in one way or the other they all are in some sense on Israel right like every every elected official in this country safer maybe like three believes that it's 2002 like that's their entire calculus on Israel that like there's a broad like people don't really know about it um the people that do care have like a broadly supportive opinion but also that like there's this level of Israeli competence that just it doesn't exist anymore but if their minds it does and that factors into their calculus in all of this but like I don't know how like it's been a month and like did you see the thing that Israel tried like yesterday the mine comic book and the children's living room that was stupid but there's an even dumber thing they produced like a piece of paper and it was like Arabic writing on one side and Hebrew on the other and they're like this is a a phrase book that Hamas was practicing they were learning phrases in Hebrew and one of them was learning how to say in Hebrew take off your pants to women so you can see that proves that they were doing tons of rapes well look that's just that's in duo linggo like you need to know how to say that little owl told me how to say that in Spanish yeah it's like obviously Arabic speakers like ripped it apart because the grammar was all fucked up like I don't know how these really army doesn't have fluid Arabic speakers they're probably using babble fish like not even a good like that's literally what it's like they wanted the phrases on there in the phrase book was they wanted apparently they want people to believe that Hamas was trying to learn the phrase how do I drive a tank in Hebrew who would they ask that too yes the Felix the fucking DMV that's on that time well I feel like you say that but it's the communicate with the Mercava's on board autopilot system yeah yeah no they were learning all the phrases like please turn on yellow stone I want to watch the live one of them all the Hamas documents were outlining all of the Taylor Sheridan shows and they're like attention Kassam Brigades yellow stone 1923 is different than yellow stone which is also different than yellow stone 1888 please make sure to have this information handy it is very crazy that they're like actual there's been so much time and money well our money like militarizing and they're like really really super bad at it like it's it's it's it's like you guys invented ways and now you can't figure out how to fucking land a rocket not on your own hospital like a fucking like looney to like a fucking tech savory cartoon yeah yeah they uh for people don't know an iron dome rocket basically like yeah this was biblical this was like something where it's like if you see this happened to your country god is mad at you it was heading to intercept a rocket coming from Gaza and it literally did a fucking you turn and slammed and slammed back it was into like wasn't a hospital wasn't a hospital or like an office building in Tel Aviv I can't remember it but it was it was deeply it was deeply like it's you know slipping it's like Israel is like holding the the soup terrain of like turtle soup and like steps on a roller skate that lands on a banana peel and spills it all over the Dowager Countess it was just like such a like bumbling fucking marks brothers move yeah and like going back to Trump I mean like obviously he was like one of the most like pro Israel presidents we've ever had he moved the embassy to Jerusalem which I do have to point out Hillary Clinton was saying that she wanted to do that back in 1997 so this is you know it's a bipartisan thing but he also he doesn't have the same like mystique around Israel that like people have been in politics for all their lives have right because he can smell a loser yeah yeah exactly like Joe Biden or even someone younger like Ekeem Jeffries they have been trained to think of Israel as like you know they can they can defeat any enemy in a week it may not look pretty but they'll get it done they're super competent don't worry they'll they'll tarant feather all their enemies through their sophisticated press operation like you're not going to look bad supporting this don't worry and like obviously that isn't the case anymore but good luck telling these guys that but Trump who you know coming more from the outside believes a lot of the same stupid shit about Israel but doesn't have the same you know institutional dogma I guess yeah kids could kind of could kind of events some loser them coming out of Israel it doesn't mean anything if he was president he would probably enact the same in credit like incredibly Zionist policy but it is it is interesting that he said that though right I mean like with many things I think he can get away with saying things that like breach the boundaries of like consensual reality in this country particularly on Israel because he is probably the most popular political figure in the world in Israel and I don't think there's much he could do to shake them from their support of him but as long as we're talking about the the PR war here I was inspired by our mutual friend who's been keeping a running list of all of the Huzbara meltdowns over the last month or so and I just decided to try to keep a running count myself this week since our last episode and I'm just going to run down the list of what I have we can talk about them like you know whichever one that you you feel compelled to discuss but okay we had a running of a very old script at the beginning of the week which is the Pallywood script the idea that all of the you know ruined bodies and crying people that you see in news footage are in fact actors their crisis actors and like they shared some clip from 11e's movie that was made about Gaza at the scene to show them like victims having makeup put on and stuff like that once again that brick almost instantly because like footage of this behind the scenes footage was included on like the DVD of the movie when it came out so it's pretty odd yeah I had the blue person yeah everybody loves blue box credit running of the outtakes from the uh from the latest bombing campaign but yeah I mean like this one is so crazy because like they're like saying oh like and none of our victims are actually victims they're acting but we are dropping thousands of bombs where they live that was replaced almost immediately with as soon as that one bricked the next one was all our victims are real people but they're also Nazis and also the Nazis weren't that bad that one's fucking crazy that like they're they're lying about this now is like well look like the Nazis were bad and killed Jews but they at least knew to be ashamed of it when were they ashamed of yeah fuck I mean presumably because they tried to hide the final solution yeah I feel like it was like rolled out with a PowerPoint presentation like in a room with yeah I can die at coax they but they were very proud of that shit um but yeah I know in the it was an article that ran in the Jerusalem post by this guy Douglas Murray and his point was and I literally there's a there's a the line in the article where he says the Nazis still had quote a spark of humanity in them unlike Hamas and also every single man woman in child in the Gaza strip is Hamas so they went from saying none of our victims are actually victims they're crisis actors to all of our victims are victims but they're all Nazis but also that they're worse than the Nazis this does have the ring of like the the anti-Semites being like look the Holocaust didn't happen but uh if it did it was good yeah exactly yeah it's exactly that exactly like that is that is like the Turkish line on the Armenian genocide a lot of the time like it didn't happen but it was good that we did it I guess the um the the dog year Hitler book the dog year copy of mine comp was part of the next one strategy yeah they're both they're bolstering the Nazis and the same week that like the official organs of like the Jerusalem post and like the of mouthpieces for this massacre are saying hey the Nazis are pretty bad but Hamas was worse because they're proud of what they're doing whereas the Nazis felt ashamed by it and you know after they spent the day shooting people into a ditch they often felt bad for bad about themselves I don't know like once again like I feel like a lot of this propaganda like their wires are crossed and there's no like coherent media messaged here because then it was what the president of Israel the Herzog came out produced a book an aerobic translation of mine comp that as you said Felix was dog year and filled with like posted notes and highlighted sections that he said was taken from quote a children's living room in the Gaza strip and it's like weird enough that like they're bringing out a book a book to be like see like see they're not sees like you know this justifies what we're doing but the phrase in a children's living room struck me is like I mean I know English isn't their first language but I mean like I was struck by the idea like children's living room because it seemed to imply that like children were reading this book and that's why it's okay that we're killing them but it also could could imply if anyone called them on that that this was just an adult or a Hamas fighter had left his favorite book in the child's living room where they were you know attacking people from so that's why it's okay that we blew it up yet maybe they're still thinking that they have their own version of like kibbles is where there's like it just like a big group parenting situation it's like that's the children's living room yeah it's like they're doing an evil Montessori class in there yeah I do like like that the dog aired pages and like that like like it's like a you know this this for editorial review uh maybe errors in it like that like the first review cop it was an advanced review copy yeah yeah Hitler DMed this Palestinian nine-year-old and was like do you want to do you want to copy of my book I can send you galleys and the Palestinian nine-year-old was like oh god that means I'm gonna have to have this guy on my show no but it came from like it's publisher to like a really chipper woman like works for McMillan yeah I didn't even know Hitler was still alive and now I have to get him on a zoom call you know I will I will point out though that when they displayed the cop the Arabic translation of mine comp it was very clear that the previous the the prior owner of the evil book did underline passages in pen and for that alone I think them and their family should be killed but like opa well what I think is like now scarred what if they just really like Scandinavian I mean like yeah yeah like it was a guy with a big beard on the front you know Ben Gavir is like reading aloud from it at the press conference under the presumption that it's like Hitler's my struggle and like listen listen to this Jew hating rhetoric there was a woman in a coffee shop wasn't she's like the most beautiful woman in the world but she had kind of like sort of a shapely body if you've found her in a way and I think about the way that I've aged and whether or not I've been a good father and that's that's 500 pages they're like this is so insidious yeah they're like this yeah this is this is a blueprint to hate okay next up on the propaganda meltdowns we had that video from someone purporting to be a nurse in the al-shefa hospital claiming that Hamas was was was storing weapons there and taking away aid from the hospital workers but like I mean I'm not it's like the credibility of this video lasts it for about 10 seconds because like feel like it's like you said Israel loves to talk about all the Palestinians and her Israeli citizens could they get even one of them to start on these videos instead they they choose to highlight a woman who graduated from the Gal Gadot School of Acting and in option pain to fill the Nile is there not one person in the Israeli government who can like speak with a credible Arabic accent yeah no I mean they can't speak in anything like we pointed this out but like in Wonder Woman she was so bad it she was so just unable to do like a flat general bland accent that every other actor there had to sound like it was like yeah yeah like they're like well fuck she is making no progress could could you like professional actors do this yeah like I'm not gonna pretend like I can identify like would someone makes a mistake in Arabic I tried to learn Arabic I'm doing go once like eight years ago and it was I think I just I that's one of the hardest languages to speak so fucking hard but yeah but hearing this woman's accent I do know what I knew I knew Israeli accent yeah yeah that fucking spit that like a spitty French accent yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I mean it's like this was the professor talks like you guys don't know what this is this is professor talks they're any homosexuals listening they'll know what I'm talking about one thing that I think is like I don't know it's puzzling with like I don't I know what list of Has Barra fuckups you're you're reading from one thing that isn't on there because it's like too broad in general is like the quibbling over like intentionality that I think is really weird that's more of a breakdown yeah it's a meta thing but it's like it's so weird to be because it's like okay if you've killed like 10 at least 10,000 civilians but you didn't mean to shouldn't that mean like okay you don't get to have a military anymore yeah like you're too you're way too shitty at this yeah I think it like you know there there was a big intentions don't matter movements in the in the 2010s like Twitter discourse but the exception I mean I always disagree with that it's attention's attention's do matter in less like it involves mass death yeah I don't know man like that's one of those things where it's like well you're bad at this and you don't get to play with that anymore you don't get to use the stove while mommy is gone yeah if it's like we we're seeking to kill like these let's say like you know 40 guys who are important in Kassamberg ads and Hamas at large whoops we killed 6,000 children that should be like everyone comes in and takes away all of your fucking F-16s like that's yeah you can't play anymore you're like you give them the like look I'm not mad but I am disappointed yeah next up on the rundown we have Hamas's use of fentanyl laced rockets you guys see this one fentanyl they're they're they're they're a source says the Hamas is considering launching fentanyl laced rockets into Tel Aviv this one is really devious because once the fentanyl rocket hits an army outpost the soldiers will leave their post and start stealing copper wire all throughout Israel so they can buy more I guess like we're so we're and then just today before I got before I got online they're because you know I mean like there've been just absolutely blood curdling accounts of snipers shooting people in hospitals like you know people in on gurneys and in wheelchairs getting shot in the throat with sniper wait you need a sniper for that how fucking stupid is your military if you see someone in a hospital bed and you have to this is like pinning down like a 14 year old and paintball yeah um so they're they're having to really because they keep saying that like Hamas has these command centers at all these hospitals that they're shooting up so that they've they've finally gotten into one of these hospitals I forget which one but they have like you know some Israeli military spokesperson kidded out in the full gear up in his name is like glove hog or something like that the goal is my favorite my favorite guy my favorite guy uh Jonathan Cornicus I don't know he is but he was basically walking around like they did of course they didn't find any tunnels under the hospital so essentially he was in like just a conference room of a hospital and pointed out that there were baby bottles a a makeshift toilet and like uh there's some papers around they were like see he was like see this is where they were keeping the hostages and we know that because there's a calendar on the wall that like that um you know expliquates hostage taking duty and then once again people like Arabic speakers have put it out that this thing on the wall was literally just like a duty roster of nurses at a hospital like they just said Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday on it why would you need to know the days of the week unless you're keeping hostages well yeah there you go this has to be the least creative country that's it's astounding it's astounding it's like and Felix I know you pointed this out but it's just like is it a product of the fact that they live in this total bubble with complete impunity so that they've never had to be smart or clever or creative or is it just like this is what uh imperial culture does to your brain this is how lazy and stupid it makes you yeah well I think that too and you know you know my theory of climates I I just think you get a Mediterranean climate you all eventually end up like Stov's grandmother or grandfather connected collecting birds I think people sort of project like what they think of American Jews on Israelis like hey my cardiologist is Jewish uh you know my daughter's roommate is a is a real go getter uh and then and then they don't understand that like when you move to Israel and are are born and raised there you're you're just a Guitau like these are yeah I mean there are the Afghansi dominated parties are like they're they all have names like good morning and like nice handshake and they're like they're increasingly uh increasingly marginal and voted like the people that vote for them are like you know uh 72 year old who has a name like an American Jewish guy and is like vaguely against settlements in the occupations but also killed like 400 Arabs in 1967 yeah and I think the like I think also the you know hamburger disco tech Capri pants ones too yeah no the um the Guitos run the country yeah yeah well as long as you're talking about um settlers uh the other the other big piece of propaganda field this week was that they let one of these settlers talk to the New Yorker about what they believe in did you guys see that in your view yeah and like look uh everyone loves giving Isaac Channeter a pat on the head for um I've got like talking to this like sub mental moron but look I think for his readership or the readership of the New Yorker they probably don't they don't encounter uh the Israeli point of view that just like yeah we're definitely colonizing Palestine and we need to kill them all for that to happen problem yeah yeah but here's the thing like I would love Isaac Channeter to do another one of his rye and knowing review uh interviews with let's say David Rennick the editor-in-chief of the New Yorker and we like on what their editorial policy is it regards Israel because they just had a piece out two weeks ago that uh basically accused Al Jazeera journalists of working with Hamas and contextualizing when their families are assassinated by the idea of yeah it would be really fucked up if uh a news outlet was in the pocket of a particular political institution that would never happen here and then actually my my favorite piece of propaganda failed this week was when the uh Israeli government accused the AP writers and the New York Times of having four knowledge of the October 7th attacks because they employed freelance photojournalists who worked with Hamas or something like that talk about biting the hand that feeds you and I think this is actually a welcome development because if look the New York Times has been known to use human shields and if Brett Stevens is killed in an air strike it's simply an understandable and justifiable not intentional but justifiable active war to get at the deep and and highly complex network of tunnels underneath the island of Manhattan yeah and I mean like it will stop when the New York Times journalist and you know photo journalists love their children more than they hate that was gonna end they love they love their children uh even more than they love the news like that's one thing that I found like remarkable about Israel this go around is so like they get incredibly mad at places like the New York Times and like the BBC or wherever real they've pretty much any mainstream outlet they've yelled at for one thing or another right but like they don't seem to understand that in order for these places to be like affected like effectively sell their their agenda they have to be seen is at least somewhat trustworthy so they can't like they can't just like you know print two contradictory things on back-to-back days like the Israeli press office is doing so like yeah they've already got the New York Times to print that Hamas uses hospitals as their command and control centers so why why you would fuck that up like using them of being Hamas is beyond me well there's also like this amazing like they they do that like quite a bit I mean they never really did a make hope all on Iraq but like they I mean remember what they were like uh you know myths of anti-semitism in uh in the in the Ukrainian military and like two weeks later they ran something that says uh Nazi insignia on on uh whatever Ukrainian military volunteers highlights thorny issues of Ukraine I had one I had one thorny issues are highlighted and that was like I there was like two weeks it was like two weeks later and and I don't I read the second one and I I believe writers don't get to pick their titles but he did like admit and kind of like sell out the mag and said well we did have these pictures earlier and didn't publish them they're just wearing they're just wearing like pointy eagles all over themselves and they're like hmm this is just this is just like you know Russian propaganda skull fans pro prosper in the Ukrainian volunteer forest the pointy of eagles do look cool it it does suck that those are ruined um so I guess uh where is all this going and the answer comes um in this headline from Al Jazeera from just yesterday billionaires are teaming up for pro-Israel anti-homass media drive the campaign is seeking million dollar donations from dozens of the world's biggest names in media finance and tech semifor reported and it says here that they're they're seeking to raise uh 50 million dollars to do another big pro-Israel anti-homass push and I gotta say if you're looking to outcloud the money homospins in the US government and military you're gonna need to spend a lot more than 50 million dollars my friend a lot more but I just want to highlight one paragraph from this piece uh this under the subhead get ahead of the narrative US billionaire Barry Sternlich who started the project said the campaign would help Israel quote get ahead of the narrative as the world reacted to the intensive Israeli attacks in the Gaza Strip quote public opinion will surely shift as scenes real or fabricated by homos of civilian Palestinian suffering will surely erode Israel's current empathy in the world community Sternlich wrote in an emails listing contributions from wealthy figures shortly after Hamas's October 7th attack on Israel according to semifor we must get ahead of the narrative so two things here one as Amber as you said earlier he says it will surely erode Israel's current empathy in the world community what are you talking about dude even before October 7th nobody in the world fuck with you other than the United States Canada and the UK no way and then this other thing yeah this is this is very jack donna g six sigma like there's there's like a whole meal like coming in with like you know with fucking you know hey we got free lacroix in the lobby let me tell you you need to remake your story and your brand like this is the most like bullshit like consultancy firm just taking them for all their worth yeah yeah get it get it get that money but i mean i i like the idea like that he says real or fabricated because they're like look the entire world is going to see uh basically a nonstop flood of images of the thousands and thousands of people were killing but like so how do we get ahead of that narrative we're certainly not going to stop killing them but i just like the idea that like these people are really think or there are people still willing to take their money to convince them that this is true that they can turn this ship around as it regards like the opinion of the world or the united states public at large like how what what is the story what is the narrative change that they're going to come up with this is going to get people to go oh actually it's quite justified what you're doing it's going to involve some word like synergy or something like that like it's just guy this sounds like just such consultancy speak i know and like i guess like the really cynical part of me knows that this is not actually about affecting world opinion or increasing empathy for israel or their cause i think like all the examples i just listed of these grotesquely absurd and darkly hilarious like these limp attempts to justify the mass murder that's going on is i don't think intended to change anyone's opinion or convince anyone of anything i think it's intended to give the people who already support israel something to say when people get mad at them or something to defend themselves with but for the most part i think it's intended to keep people me and you talking about how ridiculous i mean i said if you'll complicit in this i you know i do the show it's this is what we talk about but like it's to get people to debate the specifics of um can you really believe that they pointed to a calendar instead it was a terrorist plotting device in the hospital that they just blew up yeah well and it's and like just everything else i'm sure i'm sure the people who run this are like the failed sons and daughters of actual professors professionals and they just started a consultancy firm and consultancy firms make money no matter how bad their results are yeah sort of similar to the israeli government they keep getting money to remember how bad their results are they print that shit one thing that i think is interesting is okay so pretty much all of israel's anything that they were competent at or showed any potency uh let's say 20 years ago has completely crumbled right and um from the looks of it maybe it was never quite that good i do wonder going forward what they're going to do with how the settler's stuff is perceived in the west because like we've talked about before but i think that for better for worse that is the greatest threat to them being treated like a normal country like unfortunately well that i mean you know talk about um who could imagine such gains for the Palestinian causes i never imagined that you know what maybe she's she's maybe she's co-enthal probably she's working with the Palestinians that's what i think pierce morgan is doing yeah yeah it's like look i i'm gonna do what i can and be the most annoying person in the world until everyone was just like i believe whatever the opposite of what this woman is saying yeah but but like the settlement stuff is you know unfortunately like when you kill fucking over 10,000 people in a month through aerostrikes and artillery like western countries even if it's like you know just somehow done to a worst scale than almost anything we've seen they still like understand that right that still it's still like okay we do that but like state sanctioned lynch mobs and like handing out ARs to settlers and just like i mean pertinent to the the interview with the settler just the attitudes of the settlers is like you really can't make the argument that you're a normal country with those and like to to this point it seems like their entire strategy with settlers and how they appear to you know every other country in the world is just to never talk about that right and that's gonna become increasingly harder and i think that's what the chaneter interview hit people so hard is because like he just spoke to someone who doesn't have the guile or connections or even just wherewith or just even knowledge to know what you're supposed to say to the american media yeah i mean like to just he just spoke truthfully about what she believes in which i think is totally commonplace in israel but most people who get you know asked to be interviewed or put in front of a camera know how to manage media like they're smart enough to like understand what a global community thinks about all of this so they have to couch it and say oh israel isn't in a part-time state most Jews are actually slightly dusky but there isn't like but there isn't like a good version of the settler thing there's it like there's nothing you can say yeah right there there isn't like a streamlined like slick way of saying any of that which unfortunately you kind of can do with with like conventional military operations like obviously they're way shittier at selling that than they used to be and you know the trend isn't looking good for them but there's that like there's never been any way that they could sell the settler thing to the rest of the world without like everyone realizing how not normal a country they don't there's it's impossible it's too fucking weird there's just like the only thing they could possibly do with that is say like oh well you guys have you know you guys like killed Native Americans which is like that's just like throwing up your hands and walking out of the room that's if think about like Portugal brought back slavery yeah and they were like well what you guys did it like no one would accept that I think they did well in terms of PR for a long time just because they they kept kind of a low profile like they now they're insisting upon themselves but like you know when I was growing up it was just like you know of evangelical TV being like buy an olive tree for Israel like and then when you really just give them you're like you're not supposed to give them the microphone like you have to control you have to limit their public exposure they have to be a little discreet and they're like people are doing bad things to us this is dangerous and they're like oh shit I'm sorry that that blows we like you we don't what have to do is well back that's a real big bummer but once they get like a full on like propaganda press team on it you're like oh you're insane yeah yes yes exactly and I think what we're seeing right now is the equivalent to like someone who's been playing a video game with a cheat code for the last 70 years and now the cheat code isn't working anymore and they're throwing the controller yeah and like the cheat code is unlimited US support but like I think we're seeing like how tenuous that is I mean look they have the entire government behind them and will so will continue to do so for into the future but like cracks are beginning to emerge in a way that I think none of us could have anticipated and as long as we're talking about this like I would I wouldn't you know I would just like to encourage if you'd like to annoy people call your congressman and senators because I know they just let it go to voicemail now but like they do actually have to listen to all of your voice messages and if you even waste someone's time I think like there is a certain amount of pressure that can be brought to bear on democratic politicians right now that like look I'm not optimistic about it but like at least you can ruin someone's day yeah and sometimes spite is all we have yeah because the thing is like it like this is this is becoming increasingly untenable for the democratic party to continue to go along with this and look they are the ones you continue to do so but it's becoming very very tenuous they're running out of goodwill these these these these countries becoming more problem than it's worth and like it's becoming a pain in our ass and it was much easier when it was just sort of like a passive thing that we didn't have to pay attention to I mean it's just like one of the ways that I don't know it it does it does differ from like South African apartheid is that like you know they had like wine and diamonds we wanted like with what the fuck do we we'd be fine without it I could I'd got Google Maps I don't need ways yeah yeah exactly yeah I love when they bring up ways ways yeah oh my god I think I think I think a biotech thing like I think they might have like kind of a good but I think it's just manufacturing I don't think they invest like a whole lot in like pharmaceutical research I think they're just like let's do they're investing in startups to prolong life so that that guy and his son can suck each other's dicks from in the thousands I mean you you talked about how like they're you know they're fissures showing you know inside the democratic party and how this is increasingly untenable I thought it was notable how McCrone like kind of broke with his previous stance on this and it's like obviously no one is confused and think he has like a conscience but he like a lot of other people are realizing more trouble real it's it's like it's you this is just like untenable you can't treat this like a normal country like it's gonna fuck up everything else for you and also I another thing I'm noticed this week is like instructions going out to be like when you're defending Israel do not bring up the history of Israel because like that's a battle we can only lose and I think it's like in these narratives first rule of Zionism do not talk about Zionism yeah no initially in the defenses of Israel you would get these long least themwinder is about how oh like the knock-bud didn't really exist or they left voluntarily or just all this stuff about oh how we've been attacked so many times and like there's litany of historical facts that like previously I think people were just sort of like this shit's boring I don't care and they tune it out and accept it as true but the insistence on like discussing the history of the foundation of Israel and and its continued existence is like the more people become aware of that the work that the worse of playing field that they have to to work with yeah well it also like nobody wants to fucking read all that shit like I've I've been sent like like a bunch of petitions to sign and they're like a page and a half long and it's like man I don't even want to read that like first of all like I think I record on how I feel about the occupation has been pretty clear given given my career if that's what you could call podcasting second of all like it's they're doing I think kind of the same thing where they're trying to inundate people with information and tell like a real story to counteract the revisionism and I think that's the wrong move I think the first of all keep the messaging as like condensed as possible also you're gonna get like a ton of criticism like from the left or whatever at the same time too if you sign it because they're like why are you calling it an occupation not a genocide it's like shut the fuck up like it's just it's very it's very annoying when you're trying to be given when someone is trying to give you a whole bunch of information to sort out the real story and isn't like isn't Rochermann like a three hour movie like it's just the way to go is to keep your messaging simple and I think Israel's really like hanging itself with like this barrage of you know of insisting upon themselves with like you know these PR fucking like amber that stories yeah and that's exactly right because the message that they have to counteract which is the message embraced by most of the people on the world who are aware of it is ceasefire now that's a very simple message yeah stop the bombing and the occupation and then to argue against that from the Israeli perspective requires this like jenga set of fucking like contradictory have truths and outright falsehoods the longer you talk the more people are gonna feel like you're lying like the one of the reasons like the the Bernie petition had such impact because it was just like three sentences like I like Bernie and I voting for him people were like cool I will I'll read and sign that but it's like man if I don't want to read it nobody else wants to read just like give him enough rope let them talk as much as they want to like they're losing credibility as it is they have you know as Trump is correctly observed they're having bad objects they're losing favor just broadly with the American public not but what the American public wants not the popular will has much influence if any on you know actual political policy especially foreign but like I don't know just just just don't talk about it just be like hey this is the occupation is bad and mean these are mean it's mean it's a bad it's a bad guy and then just let let Israel have a fucking PR meltdown let them try out the guy with the dumbest name and stupidest accent in the world yeah you know why you're wrong you know what the hospital must be destroyed yeah just get a complete pants guy out there and people like you know what I just don't I don't I don't trust this guy I think I'd say a good place to wrap things up here but before we take off today Chris has an

      "text": "Hey, hey, hey, time to put your middle to the test pile. Buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, oh. Hey, hey, hey, do the general image with the best now. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Make way, make way. Oh, for Iris, finest. Oh, hello. Make way, make way. Ring the bells. Yay, Varily. Ding, ding, ding, ding. Here, here, here, here. If you see any ease, make sure they know to hear. For Iris, finest has come through. Bedecked in jewels and crowns and many belts. Oh, fine, shiny shoes. For Iris, most famous. It took me a minute to realize where you were going with this. I know where you were going with this. How does it feel? How does it feel? I'm going to Iris, my hometown, one of the worst places in the United Kingdom to be. It's in a book, the first one, as far as I'm concerned, because, as has been pointed out to me, there are many editions of worst places in Britain books because many people living in shit towns want their towns in the books. In fact, the most United Kingdom thing about me is how proud I am that I come from a shit hole. So anyway, so shit is a riff that I am the most famous person. I found this out. Someone on Twitter fighting monsters on Twitter sent this pudding people map before anyone. It's not a pudding people map. It's not a map of fat people. You fucking clowns. It's called the pudding. And it tells you visual stories. And the story it's telling me right now is I am exactly as famous as Richard Branson, who's only two towns over. So, you know, who are you more famous than in your town? Who would either run us up of famous people in your town? Oh, well, I'll tell you what, right? I absolutely fucking trounce Henry Wheatley. Yeah? Yeah. I don't know. Yeah. I mean, I've heard of you. I haven't heard of Wheatley. No. No. All he did with his life was keep the privy purse for King William IV and Queen Victoria. Wheat can get a fuck out of my town. I was having a curious look. Like, who's the most famous person from where I grew up, which was Bournemouth? Christian Bale. Apparently. Christian Bale. I'm going to have to work real hard to knock former Batman actor off of most famous person from my town. Yeah. Well, I don't have to work that hard to be Henry fucking Wheatley get out of my town. I don't have to work as hard as Ronnie Oldrich does. Yeah. Jazz pianist who was born in Erith or Philip Absolent, a stuckest artist, going a bit smaller getting to the small town that I was actually from, like that sort of near there. The most famous person from there is Stephen Alexander James, bassist for the band Blur. Also, cheese maker. Douglas McQuatter, 1912 Summer Olympic Gold Medalist team, a member. Ah, ha, ha, get the fuck out of my town. Okay, so the town that I was born in, it's a rock band I've never heard of. And it's funny because I had assumed it was going to be a different rock band that a lot of you haven't heard of. Well, you might have heard. In the 90s, there's a band live. They were from the town I was born in. But now it's this other band that I've never heard of, who I guess are currently more popular. So there's that. Now the map when I opened it showed Paradise Valley, which is right around where I spent much more of my formative time. And that, that had Muhammad Ali. Just pretty cool. My mom went on a date with Muhammad Ali once. Oh. Yeah, Phoenix, it's Muhammad Ali, all Phoenix Paradise Valley Scottsdale. And then you get dirt's Bentley and Tempe. And iced tea and Chandler. Okay. I was just having a scroll around like the UK, just looking around and famous people on that map that you're on. And I stumbled upon Yuri Gellat. I'm just mentioning that now, because Yuri Gellat is gonna come back up later. Hey, what gets your call back? Yeah, this is your check-offs gun. And we're gonna do a reference to it later by the end of the show. That's fun. Why is Yuri Gellat on the map? Who knows? The point is our next door neighbors with Kate Bush and Mick Jagger. Okay. Mick Jagger, Dartford, where I was born. All right. In a hospital that no longer exists, to mullished like the department of college that I went to. And the place where I got my first job. And many places I've gone have shut down or fallen into detritus after I've gone. Which means I either damaged it or it fell apart without me. Usually what I've done is I've put things in a situation where it all falls on my shoulders. So I've simultaneously ruined it and it fell apart because I wasn't there. But Kate Bush comes from Bexley Heath where the Broadway shopping center is. Where I used to go shopping at the shopping center. So practically best friends with Kate Bush. And the most famous person in Eareth. More famous than Alan Morton. More famous than so many footballers. Yeah. There are so many footballers from Eareth. Better than all of them. So William Anderson, engineering philanthropist, think not to mate. I am the philanthropist here because I am still alive. I didn't die in 1898. Get out of my town. Oh, what's that? What's that? Dennis Thatcher? Fucking hell. Yes, that Dennis Thatcher, husband of prime minister, Margaret Thatcher. Did you head the family owned Atlas, preservatives in Eareth until 1965? Did you get the fuck out of my town? Robert Napa? Serial killer? Get the fuck out of my town. Jim fucking started. Better than serial killers. And that's not me saying it. That's facts. I am glad to learn that you are higher rated than a serial killer. That is reassuring. Yep, that's reassuring. That said, that said, there is a more famous Eareth hometown of them me. Yeah. This is based off Wikipedia stuff and all of that, I think. I, but I think in terms of more people and more influential, and more, more people reach, is Linda Smith, who comes from Eareth, or came from Eareth, past the way in 2006, would probably be on that map if she was still there. There was not a TV panel show she wasn't on. I have got news for you and QI and all of that. And she's the only one listed with a quote about Eareth in which he said, Eareth is not twinned with any town but does have a suicide pact with Dagonum, which is a good joke if you know both places. Or just one of them actually. So long as you know that one of them shit. So anyway, that's basically... That's your fuck to the day. Yeah, yeah, I'll just wait for someone to go on Wikipedia and you know, take me off of the page for Eareth or something, you know, just to continue with raising everything. Right? You know what they can't erase though. Pod acquisition, the podcast we're on, it's about video games and we talk about them sometimes. We can do that. Like we could do that now or... Like, yeah. You want to do that later? Well. Ideally, I'd never talk about video games again. Ideally, ideally, I'd be on a rocket right now hurtling toward the sun. But we are all here. We are all here. And since we are here. And we don't have a rocket that you can get into instead. So... It's the fucking way to go though, right? I mean, it would be a way to go. That is taken control. Fuck you. I'm going on a rocket to the sun. So, who's played a video game this week? All of us are bad at some point. I bet all of us have played at least one at some point to some description. Yep. Jim, I bet you've played some. What? Yeah. I'm looking at this topic list. It seems like you've played at least a video game. Yeah. Yeah. All right. I'll just do one I don't talk much about to begin with. So it's not all front-heavy with me. Because that would be horrible. Be horrible if Pod acquisition had me talking too much on it. That would be a deviation. It'd be so terrible if people came to a show that you published and you talked on it. Oh. Taken up all the airtime now. Right. Call it, you eat cold water. Why am I still playing that? That shows you how desperate I am to keep doing something on the PlayStation 5, I think. I don't know why I'm trying to still give multiplayer in that another chance. After years of not, years of not, I would just do the campaign and then do a video about it just so I could talk about by Call of Duty is really not, you know, cool. Yeah. All called on this list, I assumed you were going to be like, ah, we're going to talk about the single player, and now I'm not multiplayer again. Yeah, I did the single player. It's like it always is every year. Big visuals, spectacle, that's very polished. Yeah. Since I don't do soft games anymore, I've got to look at the other franchises where it's the same fucking thing all the time and I've got to come up with increasingly desperate ways to say new things about it, which with Gotton Clancy's Ghost Breakpoint Recon, I just got absolutely fucking leathered. I'll probably be the same for Cardwall. That way I can just let like my eads do the talking and I don't have to bother with criticism and anything because why fucking should I, you know? Coherence is overrated. It's absolutely overrated. Oh, by the way, I lost all of that fucking footage that I spoke about last week. This was a real tragedy. I got very upset with myself and then I found many other things to blame instead of myself and then I felt a little bit better about it. It was on Thanksgiving Day and I was not giving thanks for that, let me tell you. Unlike a bit of turkey, what Conrad cooked and threw it my window. I did. And I mean, that's not easy. Jim is several floors up. Yeah, he rigged some sort of turkey trapeze shape. Yeah, yeah. It was, you know, you can find just about anything on the instructions. Rubber bands, tin can, cram it in like spam and then just fire it. I try and catch it in my little gullet. Yeah, your neighbours downstairs weren't happy about the first couple of taps, but we got there. Well, then they tasted it. They tasted the turkey and they said, the kids all right. That's how you walk, right? Most people on earth haven't eaten food. Conrad cooked. Most people on earth are fucking scumbag losers. Oh, that's very sweet of you to say. Conrad's cooking strengthens the nation. That's always been known by royal decree. So yeah, I got really off the rails there, but again, it's very uncharacteristic of this show. Did that call a duty multiplayer get any battery around every piece, is it? It was better when I was on the acid. Yeah, because then it was like the zombies were in 3D a bit. But now it's just, oh, now all the zombies look like network connection errors. There's a lot of network connection errors. Also, I haven't been able to ex-fill. You got a ex-fill from zombies two times to unlock a character. But I can't because no one wants to do it because it's an endless mode. No one wants to. Also, it just doesn't have any. I remember some of these zombie modes having like personalities to them. There was a sense of like the zombie characters had character for lack of a better term for characters. And the environment's like, like, we unique. And I remember one with all these theme parks stuff. And this is just some fucking, it's just some people with guns. And like it's as dull as the campaigns have gotten. It's just someone with a gun. And the air surman, he's to shoe. And that's it. Here's a shit-y-looking house with some snow on it. Oh, brilliant. Love it. I don't know if that's some rotation thing. I think I'll rotate some others in. But I'm already bored. And it's hard to even stay interested when the network keeps disconnecting. I played really fucking well last week. I had so much fucking footage. It's all gone. I've got shit to sober gameplay, Laura. You could always recreate the situation in which the gameplay was captured. Yeah, you can't write it off on your taxes, like, Kenya. LAUGHTER I mean, I could prove it was... I could prove it was for content, but... LAUGHTER I don't think they'll let me get away with that one. Oh, no, you might have to have one out of pocket expense not covered by taxes. It's the one I would most enjoy right enough, though. If I can't enjoy writing it off, what's the point? That's why I've tried to eat boggling. That is all I've got to say about college youth card war. I'll jump in. I've got a video game I've played more of in the past week. That Jim, I know you've also played some of this week. I've been playing more age of calamity. Ooh, that's good, that game. Yeah, yeah. I made it literally like an hour before we recorded the podcast. I saw the credits roll. Oh. I'm really happy with that game. There's a bunch of stuff I still want to do. There is a bunch of gameplay still to do, and I don't know for certain, but I suspect there's at least one, if not more, additional characters still for me to unlock. And I've put like, I've put like 50 hours into it. It really does take the hours off. Yeah. Time goes and I don't know where it's gone. Yeah, and I played many of these warriors games, of course. And this one in particular, it was like last night. I checked the clock. It was like eight. And I was like, I had a real sleepless couple of nights. So I was like, well, I'll play for a little bit, then get to bed. And I spent like the next little bit playing thinking, just wrap up and then get to bed before nine. And then the next I checked, it's past 10, you're banging on 11. I keep finding myself doing the thing where it's like, okay, well, I won't do the next story mission, but I'll clear up all the currently available side quests and suddenly three hours is gone. There's a lot. Yeah, there's a lot of that. It's very good at being like, look, your big missions, you know going in that's going to be like an hours, you know, challenge, maybe to do some of the later ones. But it's like, oh, there's going to be like five to ten minutes. That's nothing. And you just kind of keep chipping away at them and don't look at myself. They add up, which is great. I have been really, really enjoying playing through this. Yeah, that 50 hours also to see the credits roll was me being like fairly thorough, but not obsessively so. So the way that this works is you've got the map from breath of the wild. And it drops all these little pin points for different submissions as you go. And for most of them to go do the quest, you need to have certain items that you'll get by like, you need to have killed X number if this enemy or you need to have picked up this resource in a level. And I wasn't ever going out of my way to replay levels to get resources to go do a side quest if I didn't have the materials for it. I just skipped it and just did everyone that was available and was like, oh, I've done all the ones I can. Cool. I'll keep going. That was 50 hours to see the end of it. It was, off-way, the good time. Better story and story presentation than breath of the wild. I maintain that I really like breath of the wild from a mechanical standpoint. I like it sort of pacing of the way that it handles its open world, its consistency with the rules of how you interact with the world and how that opens up creative ways to explore that world. But like, from the standpoint of actually being like a good coherent story where you have some agency and you get to be a part of the cool things happening rather than just getting told about them happening. This is better. Has a better final boss I would argue than breath of the wild did? More satisfying one. I very much feel like it is a very good counterpoint to breath of the wild in there. It's like, hey, all the cool shit we hinted at that you never really got to see, go live through all of that and we're going to make it feel cool. That's good to know. Yeah, I've been enjoying it greatly. I've now played some of it. Well, quite a lot of it off of a stream. So I can actually concentrate. So I've gotten to grips with the characters and everything. Really, actually really like Impanela. I've got to grips with how that helps that schedule thing works. Yeah, I didn't get in part until I got given a later character who I won't mention because I they were a bit of a surprise one. But there's another character that had a similar move set in terms of trying to stack up these charges of glyphs that you can then use for things later. And it was playing them that made me click, oh, that's how I meant to play Impa. Right. And I'm having a lot of fun with Impanela. Yeah, yeah, Impa is just the ability to keep racking up stuff to pull off the special moves. And it's a real nice balance the way you fight with her. I've unlocked the one I mentioned to you that I unlocked. I still haven't unlocked any more, but I unlocked the first. Basically what I'm referring to is the first unpublished character, the one that would be more spoilery to say, the first novelty character. Yeah. And I very, very, very much enjoy that character. The whole concept is based around one of my favourite characters from the series overall. Yeah. One of the recurring character types. So I'm really enjoying that. Yeah, I will say that character is a little overly large in terms of being playable in some maps. Yes. It's hard to see enemies attacking sometimes because you're in front of them. There's one even larger character you will get too soon. What? Yeah, even larger. Uh, physically larger in terms of screen taken up. What the fuck? Yeah, I will say this. Both of the large characters this game has are really fun to play, but like don't ever try and play them in levels like, ah, this building with lots of intricate corridors. You're not going to be able to do anything. If it's a moblin or something, I'm going to freak out. I'm going to shit. I'm going to take a shit. I think you're going to be really happy with the next character you unlock. I'm looking forward to it because you mentioned I'm going to be that you reckon I'll be really happy about a new character and I think it's Eccans. Yeah. Yeah. You got it in one gym. It's just a huge Eccans. I think it's finally time to apologize. It's Eccans, but Eccans is the size of when Gefar becomes that snake at the end of Aladdin. Fucking massive Gefar reckons. I'd love that. Yeah. Gefecans. Yeah, Gefecans is the secret next unlockable character. Oh yeah. The return of Gefecans. But yeah, I was pleasantly surprised with how many characters there were available. I don't remember off the top of my head how many there were. It was a reasonably decent number. It was more than I expected. I might look it up now. I'm trying to remind myself how many there actually were. It's good. Yeah, there's like I think like 16 characters. Oh yeah, I'm not even halfway then. I think there were more for me to still unlock. Yeah, like there's no shortage of characters. Oh yeah, yeah. I mean they are so far it's looking like it's more than I would have expected. And what's fine with you know given the focus of the game and then just how much fright you're there is within each character. Yeah. But seeing it's many as there seem to be, yeah, perfectly pleased with that. I'm not going to turn down more characters. Oh who's across the river? It's Russell Branding. Grey is don't worry about it. Yeah, there was a bit of news about Age of Calamity this week that I thought was interesting. I kind of wanted to get your input on Jim. First week worldwide sales numbers for Age of Calamity. It is apparently already the best selling warriors game ever. Yes, yes, I did see you post that in the thing. Yeah. It is apparently outsold the lifetime sales of any other warriors game. I mean that's impressive as hell. Yeah, like apparently saying hey this thing is a prequel to that Zelda game everyone loves. That helps. Yeah, I mean when you consider that the Legend of Zelda is an all-in-composing franchise, didn't do that for Hyrule Warriors. But Breath of the Wild specifically. And there are some other factors of course. I mean Hyrule Warriors has had several releases and I don't know if we could count anything on the Wii U against anything else. Well that's the thing. It was a Wii U game that was then a 3DS game that was then a Switch game which gives it some weird baggage of do I need to play this. But I think it's safe to say that I can only guess but I feel like positioning it as something so closely tied to Breath of the Wild has only helped it. Yeah, I feel like there's been more buzz and and stuff around this one than the original even as novel as the original was. I feel like inevitably this probably is going to lead to more collaborations between Koi Teppo and Nintendo. I'm so there for it. If they ever finally do that Pokemon one. If they were to ever actually bloody do it. Because that was the one that they kept talking about for years before they did any of the Fire Emblem or Hyrule Warriors stuff. Well this is the thing. We've got Fire Emblem. We've had two Zelda ones now and the Zelda ones done amazingly. I want to see Mario Warriors. I want to see Pokemon Warriors. What's he Kirby Warriors? Just give a super smash Warriors and be done with it. Be done with it. Oh god. Yeah. But don't say soup. Be done with it. Oh my god. Okay. That is that is the except that sleeve if they ever need to get people excited again is go fuck it. Smash Warriors. Like it's even got a name. Yeah, super smash Warriors. Fuck. It's fine. Look at it. Print it. That is a licensed student money right there. Fuck, thank yeah. I've had a very good time with it and having seen the credits roll out more like mmm yeah but I'm going to go do this quest line. I can see well that's probably going to be a good one. I've got stuff I want to do in that game still. Conrad. Yeah. What have you been? What have you been up to this week? Just Hades is still. I've really been playing a lot of games. Once we finished recording pod acquisition last week it was Thanksgiving. So then then it was several days of not Thanksgiving and just vegetating and so I did play a bit of Hades here and there during that time but it really play anything else. It's just sort of like I got an hour I'm going to kill and I don't want to think too much so I'm going to play that. I will say I think I started to come to grips with the shield mostly because of the aspect that it functions kind of like you throw the thing out and just forget about it. It's a Ron Popeel shield set it and forget it but it's also fun because then you can call the shield back to you and it trails you just spinning. So I like to get that networks really well with anything that can just do an additional form of damage. I think it's best with Zeus on it. He tells that shield out there it spins it just drops lightning. Oh yeah that one's always fun. And then buff the lightnings. Well then on one run I had that going and I got the Artemis boom that fires seeking arrow every time one of your attacks hit. So I just throw that out there and it all said this bloom of green is coming off as it repeatedly hits enemies and multiple enemies and so that was that was fun. That sounds great. What I like about it is it really does register every single hit. Every hit brings one of those things out. You get a little firework display. Yeah it's beautiful and effective and you know you have lightning on there and the lightnings jolted and you have the lightning effects go two times and that really stacks up fast in terms of how much stuff is being flung in enemies. So I had a run playing it on stream I think recently where I cleared in 18 minutes. Yeah I think I did that with the the gauntlets on like Heat 5 and I'm currently in the midst of a Heat 6 gauntlet run. So I'm getting better at I'm really enjoying the added pressure of the time limit in the punishment pack. I had been doing nine minutes a couple of times and then while streaming I accidentally set it to seven and it was still not really a problem like it could get tight if you have to do all five like I talked about last week but now I'm kind of thinking I might be all in on seven minutes because it's a good baseline to start heat from. So yeah still having fun with Hades it's very good game very good. Coco I mean you definitely I feel if I played it more than me now I had to move on. No I mean not in terms of sheer number of runs I think I've only I'm only on like run 74. Oh okay I have lots of stuff that I haven't unlocked yet but you know you I think really concentrated in and played for many many many many hours in a like a few week period. Not a pack of in yeah yeah I've spread it out I I play one or two runs a day usually at most if I play in a day at all. It's very much the way I've been playing that game as well it's been my pick it up when I've got like an hour that I want to fill and that I just want something I already know and don't have to focus on too much. It's just a nice comforting thing to return to. I mean that's how I feel about all of these rogue-like games with the loop mechanic of starting from scratch and playing against why I'm so attracted to them because they're pick up and play nature and I can develop skill and experience with it and get better at it and eventually I will win but it never feels like such an investment of my time despite the fact that ultimately I am spending 60 80 100 hours playing a lot of these games. Again I think that's why I've liked going through edge of calamity this last couple of weeks yeah I've put like 50 hours in but yeah I can do in a little 15 minute chunk here and there like oh I'll just play a quick mission before dinner or I'll squeeze a quick one in while this video is rendering and yeah you can just ship it in little bits here and there you don't have to commit to I'm going to sit down for hours now. Which you know is why I haven't played more death stranding. Yes that is definitely a game that wants you to sit down and soak it in for a while. Yeah I have clearly reached a point in that game now where it has demonstrated to me that okay you've got most of the mechanics of this and you're gonna be doing this for a while and it's not that I dislike what it offers but it feels like such an investment that I'm going to be making even to play for a little bit even knowing that it's only going to take me half an hour to complete a run of some kind and I could put it down. Its scale feels so vast. It's a lot of effort. It's one of those games where it feels like if you have to stop and start cheering that session that it's going to break the flow of why you're enjoying it. I definitely feel that and I also you know and as more time passes from having been playing it it's a lot of oh okay so what was all of this again and all right yeah and having to remember things and and it's why I fall off of RPGs and have chronically done that for most of my game playing life. Yeah so about anyway what about you what else have you been playing? I've been playing some little bits of other games I've been finishing stuff off and doing a lot of like just trying to get things ticked off my list for a bit. So I went back and like properly finished bugs next and major of I've done everything I want to do in that. Being a proper completionist about it. The ending of that game is a little predictable but I think that stylistically it makes the thing it's doing have impact the way it wants it to so that's good like it it's not surprising but it's still impressive to go through. I will say the end of the game mechanically does stuff that isn't the mechanic sure doing the whole game up till then. I'd never like when a game does that when a game decides to have completely new mechanics for its finale rather than being based in what you've done up to that point. Yeah which is like a little bit I'm not super keen on but like I like having things mixed up now I like having a you know a sudden change up in gameplay for you know a short period of time. I just replayed tonight we write. Yeah and it has those you know chase stages and you know some changing up of boss fight stuff that is really different but on the whole the game generally feels the same throughout and it doesn't just stack that weird thing on the end. That's the thing I feel like that's different because it sprinkles it throughout so you know that's an expectation to have and it doesn't just do it at the end. It feels weird when it's like this is the big climactic ending of the narrative. Now throughout everything you did before and do this thing instead but I'm still really glad I gave it the time to play through it. It was a very good use of my time. I then sat and watched a 15 minute speed roll of that game which was fascinating. I went back and played some more animal crossing because I have let my island get into disrepair because there was a wild where I was really really into animal crossing and as always happens with an animal crossing game I then forget about it for multiple months. Surely you mean multiple years. Surely that game came out years ago. Surely that was it. It does feel that way huh? Christ. I will say I very much appreciate that none of my fill that no villages will leave your town without talking to you first so after coming back after like four months gone. Several of my villagers were that I very much like and went out of my way to find were like oh I was thinking about leaving. What do you think? I was like no stay here. Thank you for checking with me before you went so I didn't lose anything. My good animals that live in the town. There's now mushroom lamps. My whole house is just full of glowing mushrooms. I continue to think that game is really lovely. I will forget about it for huge amounts of time and then go back to several weeks of playing it daily. I have very much an ebb and flow with animal crossing but to Nintendo's credit they've continued to add regular content to that. I came back in after a few months away and was like oh I can dive under the water and there's new buildings over there that they've been adding stuff regularly enough that I had new things to do when I came back which is nice. What about you Jim? What have you been playing? I've been playing games. Yeah yeah I've played some games definitely. I have done Demon's Souls. Yeah I've still been doing some of that to enjoy the old Demon's Souls there. No bother. Is it still good? Still good. Still a good video game. Still pretty good. Still pretty pleased with that piece of the pie. Yeah it's good. I let's see I've made good progress. I got into a swing of it where I was just really blazing through so I have done all of well two two three four round five now actually. It's just the one. Just one four I've got to do. The really fun bit. It's been good. When I played this game way back in the day when it first came out. Yeah I can't remember if I even had a PS3 that was online at the time. No I must have done. No I had it online definitely because there's something about PvP that I never really got to experience much of it. So I ended up in the area where a lot of that happens and had had a good laugh there. That was a surprise that some of my survival of that. You know held my own in my own fight in in the area and and ruined someone else's day at one point and got invited. There's actually my jumpritions video. It's a wonderful little bit where someone invites. We circle each other and then just like by a pixel I'm able to scoot round them and then they fall right off the side. So I've been having fun there. I'm not a super like super inter the monthly player like the PvP aspect of of Souls games but certainly if I'm if I happen to be invited while I'm playing I'll typically enjoy giving it a go and I want to say half the time I do all right so it's it's a fun little side thing for me. I've spent a lot of time not in sole form in the actual physical form and I've not been invaded all that much so I'm not sure if it's just I'm not in the right area or whatever or even maybe the right level or what I have yet. But I've had fun enough with it while I've been when I have been invaded. I've done some of the co-op stuff as well but certainly in this day and age they really do need to make better online features for these games. The passive online stuff is still as enjoyable as ever I love seeing the little. Not just the death ghosts that you can look at but the little white ghosts of players that are just in that area in real time. I always loved that the atmosphere that brought but sitting around trying to you know be summoned or summoned and waiting for ages and dealing with constant connection issues. It's just not on. This is every single game now it's not on but other than that really really been enjoying it really appreciated having the opportunity to play through it again in a way whether the online is more prevalent if not you know way better functionally plus you know it still looks it looks really nice all of the remade stuff like in it really like it. Plus I still got to say it is the first game with a character creator where I'm 100% happy with the character I made because this was both the first one with you know this big non-lots set of options that I played after my coming out so I was able to really sort of get into that and I've after all of these character creations I could never really get into I was genuinely thrilled with there. Yeah so I'm doubly pleased with my demon souls. Nice other stuff this week I've been plotted along with more Pokemon I'm still chipping away at trying to get all of them shiny Pokemon in that way that I'm just sort of eternally doing so Pokemon Sword and Shield the 400 and something Pokemon species that are in that there's only 20 left I don't have as shiny ones. Oh I'm really fucking close apparently I'm like 95% of the way there so I'm close enough now that it's become like well then I'll have Gen 1 and Gen A and then I can sort of work into the middle of like all Pokemon ever made I have like 75% of them in shiny form I'm continuing to just plug away at that little by little yeah that's pretty amazing I don't know what I'm gonna do with myself when that's gone because that has been the outlet for obsession brain for good couple of years now has just been just just I'll just get one every now and then just a little bit here and there then you move on to the the Luna 10 10 oh god yes that when I get back into 10 10 yeah because I saw that on the PS5 store and I couldn't quite remember if that was the thing we would we'd been talking about yeah yeah yeah and and I have since forgotten entirely about and not gone to see if any progress has been made or anything you want about the one with the dancing vegetable dance battle one yeah that's not 10 10 now that's ublets oh damn it ublets yeah ublets is actually I forgot to go back to that I was really enjoying it I'm I'm curious I'm gonna do a search ublets how's it going how's it going ublets no 10 10 was the one that had the the the the the pig it was that Pokemon MMO title and it had that the Luna characters and had a pagan we're already happy about the pagan it's it's life yeah it's good pig it seems like more content has been added to ublets as it has gone on there is more ublets content I don't know how much more ublets content but they have added more content they added some sort of spooky you with stark and spooky over here oh god I would have loved to apply that which is terrified to shit out on me fan of rain the other thing I've started playing and I'm I've not laid a huge amount of it but I want to make time for it this week is I started playing ghost runner to sum it up it's basically mirage if you put it in like one of those dark techno cyberpunk settings and you had a sword so it's one of those games that's very much like free running based don't ever stop moving just sort of keep moving across the environment lots of wall running sort of do a tuck and roll as you land sort of thing first person the difference being you have a sword any enemy that gets a chance to kill you you get hit by them basically once and you dead once or twice and you dead you can kill enemies with your sword without even breaking your stride and very much of the point of the game is just don't stop moving slice anything you get close enough to and keep running and it plays really nicely it is the first game of this kind since probably mirage that has really nailed the feeling of momentum in a way that I'm happy with it's got some little things that that are distinct in your moveset like notably very early on you get a grappling hook that you can use to sort of swing across sections of areas there are very clear glowing points that are like you can swing off that if you want but it really captures that sense of I can see exactly what I have to deal with there's frequent checkpoints I will work out the route through this where I can kill everyone that I need to and not stop moving and hit the other side nice and quick to reload should you need to which has kept me like I've never felt too frustrated by any particular encounter just by the nature of how it's set up it feels a little more like you're going through levels than mirage did it feels a little less of a here is one big world you're slowly moving through but yeah I'm having fun with it I want to make more time for it it is a fun game that I played enough off to go this seems really cool and haven't had enough time to go back to yet sounds good yeah anyone played anything else should we move on to new z-bets a plate something else yes it's worth bringing up watch it watch it play I'm like worms rumble no number worms oh number worms I love me some worms yeah they rumble now are they rumbling yeah yeah can you guess take take a wild stab in the fucking dark as to what type of game worms rumbles is is it a battle royale oh you got it come right yeah that explains both why I hadn't heard of it and why I'm not interested so why is little boy who solved this thing sees riddle my initial guess was like easy to game that has rumble features as if that was going to be a particularly like novel selling point no no no no no worms rumble we got rumble support for this one conrad solved the riddle of the forest which the answer to which is where rumble is a sort of a battle royale sort of to be honest I've had a lot more fun doing the just the regular deathmatch type because the moment a game like that becomes all about elimination it's brief and shit in my experience so far but basically it's to its worms but it's not turn based to its real time side scrolling still with all of the usual weapons so it's it's basically like a big mass plate I think it's like it might be 32 players maybe more the think 32 it's like a massively multiplayer platformer with all of the traditional worms mechanics built in sort of yeah yeah it's it's yeah it's just a big shooter more or less hard to be excited scrolling shooter with lots of players it's it's all right you know it's not brilliant yeah that doesn't sound hide it no no you know it's got you're spawned with like a the baseball bat for like basic melee and like oh god and usually like a shotgun or something the shotgun itself is pretty useful there's a lot of bouncing and rolling around and and shooting at each other oh it has been and then they've got all the other stuff you know they're the holy hand grenades in there the sheep launcher the banana bombs and rocket launchers and plasma guns and all of that they all behave you know differently based on their strategy counterparts and it's fine it's not terrible it's it's it's not brilliant but it's I'm not having a bad time I did accidentally spend money on it here's the problem this is the third time this new generation I've managed to get some buyers remorse going right play has no limits folks so first time was I go on the PlayStation store and it didn't look all that clear to me that certain games for sale there were not out yet so I think I mentioned this at the time I accidentally pre-order death loop by months now I was like I didn't know that was a launch title cool and then yeah there was a reason why I hadn't heard that it was a launch title before then so I've got that way to for months second bit of buyers remorse obviously it was the demon souls deluxe edition sure obviously third was I'd just been streaming Hyrule warriors for a while and did that you know when you'd like go from like a Nintendo system or a Hideo Kojima game to like PS4 PS5 you know Xbox game and the buttons for confirming and canceling a reverse so I'm distracted on the phone while also trying to get off of this screen I accidentally tapped on trying to get out of it for these fucking costumes for this fucking burns battle royale game and then I fucking buy it so if you see someone dressed up like a wizard even though they don't really give a shit about wizards it's because someone's trying to get their money's worth which didn't even work because in the base game there's a hockey mask you think I'm going to be wearing a fucking wizard beard with that around no oyster of money I painted all my guns with the stupid comic book skin I get fucking something out of it it's fine it's an okay game it's fine yeah you know what if it were I mean it's not even the sort of thing that can be free to play well on PlayStation plus it's free it's the full guys thing yeah it won't be a successful as full guys I tell you that fucking much is a PS5 only or I think it's on pretty much everything I think but for that promotion because I'll go download it on the PS4 I don't have to pay for it but I think it might be PS4 as well actually I have to check that out I think it was one of them once where I had the option when I was buying like which version to download mm-hmm there are men in the village of Eryth that nobody see a thaw here earth and there looms on the march of the river a barge that nobody roweth or stireth that's a poem about Eryth from William Cosmo Monkhaos so but you are more famous than they are probably I don't know where was William Cosmo Monkhaos born I don't know I don't know how many Twitter followers has he got was Twitter around today seem for say so we got some music bits this week that's really that was a silly question he was born in 1840 wouldn't be able to use it yeah so music bits I don't know how much either of you know about Yuri Gella and the fact that he stopped to poke him on card being sold for 20 years I thought you were about to say something like Yuri Gella and the phantom hourglass like like you had some like wonderful puzzle game or or platform or something that we're all about to enjoy unfortunately not I assume you're both at least passingly aware of this this old story I vaguely recall something I mean I vaguely recall many stories about Yuri Gella being involved in something weird yeah so the short version is there's a magician illusion this deep person called Yuri Gella there is a con artist and performer named Yuri Gella either than you you probably know Yuri Gella better than I do because I only really know him from his involvement in this you want to explain Yuri Gella before I get into this he used to be on tv all the time when I was a kid yeah Yuri Gella is a mentalist who would perform feats of psychokinesis basically he bended spoons that was yes that was the gimmick the whole cliche about bending spoons was something he popularized like he was world famous exactly you know he he made an appearance on the tonight show in 1973 which was actually pretty disastrous from one perspective in that James Randy who was one of these people who outs magicians and you know mediums and things like that people who are trying to take advantage of people with these sorts of techniques had been aware of Geller and trying to undermine them for a while and actually worked with the tonight's show staff because Johnny Carson had been a magician as well and skeptical of them and so they actually sort of forced Yuri to perform with props that they had provided and cleared and Yuri couldn't do it and hats off to Carson by the way right coming up as a magician and then pulling the latter up well now to be fair to be fair Carson was honest about being a magician like and magicians hate it yeah when people use those sorts of tools and techniques to take advantage of people I was on a web this was a thing with Geller so was this he was claiming to have actual magical powers is that the situation oh yeah he was claiming to have supernatural powers well up until the mid 2000s I'd always just assumed that this was his illusion acts that was very clear like oh how am I doing it let everyone morning shows and stuff like morning chat shows and all of this and he'd be like yeah look at me bend his feet and I can do this with my mind and I fully cracking on that he was like an actual psychic okay I was reading actually because I was reading up and catching up on my Yuri Geller facts before coming on because I knew we were going to have to talk about it and I I knew I would have to know my Yuri Geller if you come for Yuri you come correct well yes because he's dudes incredibly litigious as we're about to get to I will say this looks great holy crap dude looks great does not look his age huh no does not look his age he does not look old enough to have been performing on TV in the late 70s no well that's the thing is the the great irony is he was lying about the mundane spoon bending but the whole soul bonding thing he had that down like he already had the factory picked out and everything but even even a year ago in an interview on television you know and and for a while he he has been he continues to be asked do you have supernatural powers and in the last recent years he's been saying no I I don't and in this one interview he says no I don't have supernatural powers then looks at the camera and winks and it's like fuck you Yuri Geller mmm fuck you why do you keep pulling this shit uh there's a lot there's a lot of reasons to not like Yuri Geller yeah here's a story Laura yeah this is the reason that like I've been aware of Yuri Geller most of my life so um of all the original generation Pokemon there is one Pokemon that has never been released as merchandise or as Pokemon cards for 20 years oh I remember this now yeah so the short version if there is a Pokemon called cadavera it is the middle age stage evolution between Abra and Alakazam which starts off as this little like thing with little kai is and ends up with having to a spoon in each hand and a big beard but Yuri Geller 20 years ago tried to sue Nintendo and the Pokemon company for 80 million dollars for infringing on his personal identity basically cadavera's Japanese name is I'm gonna pronounce this probably very badly Yungera which is a pun on the Japanese pronunciation of Yuri Geller all three Pokemon in this trio have names that are puns about famous magician's side kicks Edgar case Yuri Geller and Harry Houdini are the three like clearly the pun names for the stages of this psychic Pokemon but the thing was the name is a pun on Yuri Geller and the Pokemon holds a spoon that it psychically bends and Yuri Geller basically went nope if you're not going to pay me 80 million dollars I'm going to sue you if you ever release any kind of merchandise involving this Pokemon I genuinely like I've seen many of these fucked up lawsuits and stuff but I genuinely still can't believe Nintendo capitulated on that like have they made any concession in the way they have but that's the thing Pokemon was still a relatively new thing like he jumped on this as Pokemon was like just a twist released in English language it was starting to have its thing yes I think that that actually in a lot of ways and this is just me theorizing I have no particular special insight into Yuri Geller's motivations or anything of that but based on things that he has said about it I do think that that does sort of partially relate it's that it's growing popularity in English speaking areas coincides with a bit of the last dying gasps of the satanic panic Pokemon at least here in the United States was really demonized by evangelical far right groups and you can hear it in the response that Geller has to this at the time saying that they've transformed him into a demonic monster and when you are a person who traffics in a lot of I'm going to be delicate and say fringe ideas hmm you're feeding from a lot of the same troughs you're speaking to a lot of the same audiences because if you're open-minded enough to accept certain ideas you might be open and minded enough to accept my ideas yeah and like here's the thing like Jim you were saying the the idea of Nintendo capitulating to this is surprising I know it's it's just something I never be able to believe that Yuri was able to pull it off like you can't sell merchandise of this one with a spoon because I it's just you know the greatest trick Yuri Geller ever pull well physically from the outside my my best guess is that Nintendo probably was going fuck we can't afford to risk getting into a lawsuit on this property that we need yeah it's charting to be the biggest thing in the world just fucking okay we won't touch that one Pokemon let's keep going also dude has them dead to rights well I mean really like it's not it's not a likeness it's it's easily parody yeah I completely agree with you but if you are a huge corporation you have to ask yourself what's the bigger threat creating a legal precedent that could create either direction could be both good or bad in massive proportion or you continue with the stable decision back off and make your money yeah I guess the other thing that would have made it an easier decision is the fact that it's what was it cadabra or like it's a committee stage of not that well known like beloved Pokemon if it was Pikachu then maybe but here's the thing is what it is meant is that ala kazama has for a long time been one of like the most well loved psychic type Pokemon in the games it is the one that got like it's the only psychic Pokemon in the initial batch that got like a mega revolution in the games ala kazama's a big fucking deal oh yeah I mean I'm just saying from the perspective of when this is kicking off yeah and everything merchandise wise is so focused on a handful I could see that being an easier decision than if they were like right if you sell that bulbous saw with a spoon in its mouth your toast they'd probably put up a bit more of a fight for one of the flagships yeah but like it's been weird in that like the cartoon hasn't used to cadabra in 20 years it has been like a big thing the first episodes of Pokemon anime I ever watched was that one yeah with a minute yeah with the one with the cadabra in it yeah the psychic is it the psychic gym episode right yeah Sabrina's gym yeah that's the one is it was the first time I I could heard of Pokemon but I'd never really played the games I watched that anime obviously found James from team rocket brilliant started watching it a bit more yeah then got a game by off my friend at school for 10 pounds and um got Pokemon red my brother got blue and then we uh went through it from from that the reason I bring your regalor how yeah there's an actual story yet there is a special story we've been leading to which is out of the blue this week he tweeted I was gonna call it an apology it kind of is but like in a way that like he refuses to let go that he did anything wrong I'm truly sorry for what I did 20 years ago kids and grownups I am releasing it's all up to Nintendo to bring my cadabra Pokemon card oh that's the play there's the fucking play is he is not letting go of ownership he's going nope that card is mine but you know I'm being gracious enough to let you use it it will probably be one of the rarest cards now jury it's already one of the rarest cards because you wouldn't let them fucking make this is like I mean this is the consumer grifter right to this very day yeah after all that time sitting on it now's the time to get your username back out there yeah now it's time to become the face of this one Pokemon card it really seems like he's making a place so that like if Nintendo does bring a cadabra back that he'll go ah you can all thank me I got them to bring it back it really seems like he's trying to make himself the hero of this situation I mean it's look at it the where he is right now career wise like and I don't mean that as a slight I mean like it's probably a good idea for him to do something that costs him nothing that he can then take credit for and and start going around officially telling everyone that he is a Pokemon like it's a it's good marketing in a way for today's youth from the perspective of being a is in my opinion a piece of human trash this is a very good move this is the right move it it was the right move at any point now I mean making hay out of it trying to make yourself out to be the heroes kind of scuzzy oh no I mean it's it's it's it's a grotesque you're gonna year it's an impressive grotesque rate yeah yeah and I'll note this Yuri didn't just do that one tweet and go yeah we're done he's been trying to milk it for a couple of days now of course he has this is the moment you said my cut I was like oh we all know where you're is taking this taking it to as close to the bank as he can get and I'm interested to see how far that is by releasing one Pokemon cut yeah so he's then put another tweet out with a video attached I never realized how powerful and important it was for me to lift the ban on cadabra especially for all the kids around the world what a little to heard Yuri get a friend to children everywhere that's his new play I rescued Pokemon for a new generation Yuri get a you monster he's the only puppet monster here is you Yuri I wish I weren't so fucking impressed by it right that's the problem you know what's the thing he's clearly doesn't actually dislike cadabra was a Pokemon being based on him because in the video attached to that tweet he opens up a suitcase in which he owns a suitcase full of cadabra memorabilia including well Pokemon cards of course he does of course he does he has cadabra Pokemon cards I mean I don't know I'm not psychiatrist but moving on um yes you'd I'd have that for evidence if I were gonna be ready to bring suit I know I'd have in my possession every single example like I could get my hands on I don't know the the way the way you watch him taking this stuff out the suitcase it seems like he's fucking like these are my treasured possessions yes because they're valuable as fuck now yeah it's weird seeing this thing that he allegedly hated happened these just like let me open up my suitcase a pristine memorabilia the opportunistically hated it I'm checking this shit out right now wow he hasn't opened this cave since he and I quote put the ban on Pokemon yeah he's so powerful yeah that here's here's here's the nightmare gym that man is 73 years old he's throwing these he's throwing these action figures down like like their photos of a cheating spouse he's like look at these look at these look at what you've done the fact he's willing to pull them out the bag like I don't think he's got these here to be like these are financially valuable he's just like look at all my cool shit no this is evidence this is proof of my claim that I am this image so yeah Yuri Yellow is trying to get himself good will by undoing the weird thing he did 20 years ago also have you noticed in the background of that he's got a car entirely covered in spoons I mean again I the dumb thing he did or weird thing he did 20 years ago it makes Yuri Geller sense then yeah as much as this decision makes Yuri Geller sense now bless you all and Pokemon Yuri Geller cadabra is free finally that's his last triumphant message what a hero he is free from me what a fucking hero I have freed him I took cadabra out of the basement where I've had him locked up for 20 years celebrate I have freedom there's something to be said for for people who lift their own oppressive decision making and then expect price for it at this point I don't want the Pokemon company to start making cadabra cards again I want them to just fucking ignore it he's done this ago no fuck you yeah they haven't needed the spoon in 20 years why they need it now yeah why do we need it now yeah it's fine you fine see yeah the other thing I was gonna throw in the newsy list because it's just a thing I've seen go in around a bit and I'm like oh god this is gonna be a thing probably oh wait a minute wait a minute one second one second sorry yeah Yuri Geller just tweeted again and he wants how much for those ps5s fuck you fuck Yuri soft oh I'm sorry this was the other thing that I I did want to bring up just as given example of Yuri Geller and this is from their Wikipedia page by the mid 1980s Geller was described as quote a millionaire several times over and claimed to be performing mineral dousing services for mining groups so yes sure I will not hear a bad word said against the liberator of cadabra against a man who saw an injustice and thought I'm gonna stop it in a minute have day you besmirch that noble soul Yuri fuck yeah last thing I wanted to bring up just because any excuse to remind people that David Cage is an asshole is a good excuse to remind people is an asshole wonderful actor star of Juno Elliott page has come out as non-binary yay congratulations for them very nice you're loved to see it big congrats absolutely love his work I am very excited for him but this is a great opportunity for us to bring up how shit David Cage is again so you may remember from when was this back in early 2018 there was a big report out of that quantic dream David Cage's studio might not be a great place for people to work yeah the hub that quantic dream is certainly at the time of the reporting is noted for being a toxic sheep to work out for such that quite a few people yeah the reporting covered such accusations as are staff being overworked deliberate overlooking of racist and sexist jokes there was a thread of 600 crude often homophobic photo shops and other inappropriate behavior going on at the company there was some Nazi stuff thrown in there because of course there is of course yeah so LeMonde newspaper at the time spoke to David Cage and he denied accusations that it was a rugby locker room scenario I'm gonna read from this destructoid post about the events perhaps most damning is two employees recounted an incident where Cage was viewing security camera footage of Burglary and he turned to an employee of Tunisian descent and inquired if he was related to them oh yikes so there was a lot of accusations of homophobia and anti black racism and Cage was asked about these and this is how we we bring it back to Elliott Page you want to talk about homophobia I work with Elliott Page who fights for LGBT rights I remember this fucking quote yeah you want to talk about racism I work with Jesse Williams who fights for civil rights in the USA judge me by my work so you're just a reminder that David Cage will pull out I can't be homophobic look at my LGBT friend that I hired once two points on it as well he wants to say judge me by my work we could judge him by the fact that Elliott Page did not consent to a full nude character model being mined yes and was not happy to find out that that had happened without consent oh it indeed which is all the more uncomfortable given the situation now that's yeah that is not great that that's a thing that happens secondly and this is just on a more sort of smarmy note right he made that quote after I did that gym position years ago where the running joke was David Cage saying I've met Elliott Page yeah and he literally used that excuse to justify him and his studio's bullshit yes so just a reminder Elliott Page does not stand favorably in memory of having worked with David Cage and David Cage is like I don't care I'm gonna hold you up as my LGBT friend yeah I mean even if Quonney Dream had not soured that professional relationship using Elliott Page and his association as as a shield as like just using people as resources and deflections like that's scumbag behavior and that already marks you out as someone who's not to be trusted right there one of the reasons I bring this up is there is this little bit in my brain that goes at some point David Cage is gonna fuck something else up and go I'm not a transfer but I've worked with Elliott Page like I can see that happening someday and I'm just like just he's done this before keeping eye on if he ever goes there yeah oh people will not have seen me go off on David Cage in a way I will if he ever I mean I'm I am already livid at him already pulling what he pulled yeah especially in defense of the shit that Quonney Dream stands accused of which to my knowledge I don't believe we've ever got a resolution on that but then when do we ever not really we got a Quonney Dream statement where they were like no no no didn't happen no no no name was absent during this year's round of of discussions because it happened the allegations came out a few years ago and they weren't brought up again but yeah it's not a defense if if your defense of we don't ever talk to work environment here are some queer people we know especially in the way he said it's well you want to talk to me about this as if he's an expert because he's worked with Elliott Page just just reminder that Quonney Dream would never held to accountable for that and that was his defense at the time so Quonney Dream a shit don't support them holds himself up as some sort of visionary yeah and he is so demonstrably constantly dense on anything of any substance oh he knows what films look like and can I put that but he can't tell you anything about the meat of them let's see yeah that's this week done yeah so didn't any where lighter it's Christmas soon well I've time to play video games you know a monument appeared in like the American in like Utah yeah and then it disappeared and now there's talk of another monument somewhere else and and here's here's hear me out hear me out okay I swear to God if I find out that this is some kind of fucking marketing stunt oh 100% it's an ARG that's gonna lead us to Halo Infinite or some shit yeah the first I heard I knew something was going on and I saw Fortnite's name associated with it because they'd already done that thing they've done where they dropped a big burger head somewhere or something I didn't know anything about what the monument was I just knew something mysterious was happening in the country and it was probably some fucking marketing thing should we wrap should we wrap up here for this week tell you what right we can do that yeah we can do that oh shit sorry I put my killer crab alien toy down and one of the chess bursters fired out of its chest and hit my metal drinking cup made a real nice little skittin noise I mean you know earlier when you were doing you he he he that would be the perfect bell sound oh it's too light now we brought it full circle the podcast started and ended we bookended well this

Today's episodes brought to you by me, Undies, me Undies, the Undies that have on me. Also, it's never brought to you by uncommon goods. Could you stuff something unique for your friends or your family this holiday season? Let's jump into this podcast. Hello everybody, it's time for Cousin Crendor. The Crendor and Mortgage. In the Mortgage. The Rock has the ball. Live, live, live. In the Wild, we're going to the Wild. Mortgage. Hello everybody, long story short, I'm Jackson Crendor the buddy. Hello. Boy, hi. Hello. See you're doing. I see you're doing well. You could say that you'd probably be wrong. What does that mean? What's going on? What's going on? Well, I have the Covey 19. Do you Crendor? No. Yeah, well, I'm on day six. I'm doing better. Wait, you've had Covey for it. So, did you get it after the last episode we filmed? Yeah, in fact, it kicked in the day, the night after we did our deepest trench. Damn dude, well I'm glad we got that in, I guess. That's pretty good. Yeah, so let me tell you a tale. Okay. Please do. I'm pretty sure I know where I got it. So, there's a thing that happens apparently called the Sonic Symphony. What? What is it? Hold on, what is it? There's a thing that happens apparently called the Sonic Symphony is a hell of a way to start this. Yes. Apparently this happened. This is in a pothical tale. It may not have actually occurred. So, we have a friend. He works at Sega. And so, he's like, hey, would you guys like to go to the Sonic Symphony for free? And I- Okay, hold on, time out, time out. I now realize when he said Sega, I thought you meant it was like the Sonic reverberations of this Symphony, pulse through your body in a once in a lifetime experience. You mean literally the hedgehog? Yes, the hedgehog. Gotcha. Okay. Yep. And so, it was in downtown Chicago. So, he flew in. And it was actually last Saturday. And we were like, all right, great. Sonic Symphony, we went. First half, they played Sonic Old Songs. And it was like a symphony. And I was like, it was great. Second half, they brought out a metal band. And I guess modern Sonic songs are like metal generic metal music. This is the best way I can describe it. And everyone was like screaming. And they're like sing the words. And I was like, dude, I don't know any of these songs. So I just stood there like, all right. And I'm pretty sure that's where I got the COVID-19. Probably, I would imagine, you know, I don't want to put that on Sonic fans, but I'm going to say gamers in general. The last time I got COVID, I went to a con. And I was sanitizing like crazy. I was going out of my way to make sure I wasn't spending too long stuck in like crowded rooms. I was doing great. Within days, started to feel chills. And it was like, something's not right. I don't feel well. Everyone that I was hanging out with, I had to leave them. Like, we woke up early in the morning. We were going on a walk. And at breakfast, I started feeling chills. I was like, I don't feel right, guys. And rather than hang out, the rest of the time we were there, I went back to my hotel room and slept thinking I was like, food poisoning or something. No, I had super COVID. And it sucked. Like, yeah, I tried. I still got it. So I definitely blame, you know, this is the same crowd where people have to remind them to wear teotorant at conventions, you know? Exactly. And there's probably people from all over who flew in for this as well. Because it was like a pretty big thing. Yeah. Like all around Chicago. So it was just and you know, it's a place everyone's screaming. Right. Singing all this. So I, I knew. That's like, it's for a Sonic the Hedgehog. Did it, dude? Sonic the Hedgehog gave you COVID? Yep. And so that is the title for today's episode. Let me, episode 440. Sonic the Hedgehog gave me COVID. So, uh, then the fun fact was we were literally talking about getting our Kobe boosters. We were like, yeah, we had COVID two years ago, because we last got COVID. Almost exactly two years ago. It was like two days off, which is kind of weird. Sure. But I guess it's not that weird, because this is around the time everyone gets sick anyway in like October. Right. Yeah. So we were like, yeah, in general. Yeah. So we were like, we'll go get a boosters. And then there was Sonic that it Sonic. He didn't care. Damn. He didn't care about our boosters. So yeah, uh, I will say it's better than last time, but still bad. I mean, you sound fine. I'm better. Well, I'm on like day six. So like, I'm sure that's what I'm saying. Sounds like you're pushing through it. Yeah. So the, let me give you the, the arc here. Cause we'll do last time I had COVID. The sore throat was terrible. It was like the worst sore throat I'd had since mono. Like if we're ranking sore throats, number one, mono, number two, that COVID sore throat. All right. And then I lost my taste and smell on like day three for like two weeks. Damn. So I still got my taste and smell. It's a little like muted, but like it's mainly because my sinuses are congested and whatever. So I'm like, thank God. And it's getting a little better too because my sinuses are calming down. But we played that game, right? And then I went to the gym. I mean, I felt fine. And so I worked out. I did cardio. I was running. I was doing great. I was like, all right. It was a good like 45 minute workout. I ran. I did some elliptical. I was doing all right. And then I was like, all right, night time. I was going to stream the Ulduar raid for time walking while. And I did. But as we were doing that, I slowly started feeling it. You know when it starts hitting. Yeah. Oh, absolutely. Something's off. And so right then, um, I was like, oh, that's, oh, not I forgot the fun part. So toaster woman was like, I'm feeling a little off. And I was like, I don't know. I feel all right. And she's like, maybe I should take a COVID test. And I was like, yeah, you can do that. We were just at the Sonic show. And then her test was negative. So I was like, oh, I guess you're just whatever. Then I'm doing this Ulduar thing. And I'm like, I'm feeling a bit off. So I'm like, maybe we are sick. And then I took a COVID test after it. And it was very positive. And I was like, well, and then the next day she took another test. And then her started being positive. And I was like, well, there it is. The fact that you both got got. Yeah. You're like a super spreader event. However, our Sega friend. Fine. That's because you were probably sitting next to the person. You know what I mean? Well, he was sitting next to us and he was staying. Like, he stayed here the one night. So I don't know. Well, but I will say, apparently he's also had COVID like three times already. So maybe he was any guy boosted. So interesting. Yeah. I don't even know. Either way, first few days feel interrible. There's pretty much like a bad cold. I had a cold back in February. It felt like that. And then dude, I made so much chicken soup. Let me tell you. From scratch? Yes. So how you make out? How you make it from scratch, chicken soup? What's your, what's your, what's your recipe? So I found a recipe back in February when I had a cold. I wanted chicken soup. All right. And it is, if you search chicken soup recipe on YouTube, I might be, it might be the top video. Actually, it's up there. It's Natasha's kitchen. Okay. Yep. I see that. I watch that. I was like, dude, this is pretty easy looking good recipe. So let me ask you a quick, like real quick. Let me ask your question. Okay. Did you pick it because the number of views? Like, what was your, what was your reasoning behind Natasha? Because I'm looking at so, for those who are curious, let me tell you what, cooking chicken noodle soup videos look like. Here's every thumbnail. Close up of the soup, followed by one half the thumbnail, being the face of the person who probably is cooking the soup, smiling at you creepily. Yes. That's, that's like there's way too many of these. So I picked hers because I just thought it looked the best. Okay. Yeah, it just, uh, it kind of reminded me of my moms when she would make it. So I think that probably carried into it. I'm like, that kind of looks like my mom's chicken soup. And I was like, it says easy. I don't want to have a hard chicken soup when I'm sick. So I was like, screw it. So we, uh, we ordered the groceries over the internet. They arrived. I, uh, got what you do. You, you boil some water and some chicken stock. All right. Then you put chicken thighs in there. You boil them. All right. See get that chicken thigh flavor mixed in. Okay. Then you cut up some celery, some carrots, and onion, and some garlic. You saw pay the garlic, celery, and onion. Okay. Not the carrots. Important. Then you, uh, take the chicken thighs out of the soup after like 20 minutes, 15, 20 minutes, uh, and then you shred them. And then you put the sauteed onion, garlic, celery into the pot with the carrots. Then you put in some pasta. I don't like a lot of noodles. I like some noodles. But if you go too heavy on the noodle, it gets a little, uh, it's like a little too crazy, you know what I mean? I like, uh, I like more broth. So then you let that cook for a bit. You put the chicken back in. You put some dill in there. You got to get the dill. And, uh, that's it. Then you just let it simmer a little bit more. Go to the flavors, uh, join together and we got some sourdough bread. Dude, I ate that two meals a day for the last like three days. That's good, though. That's probably exactly what you needed. It is. Every time I ate that, I felt great. I was like, dude, I'm, I could, I could do anything. And then you'll wait a bit and you're like, uh, kicks back in. But, uh, I'm definitely doing a lot better. I'm at like 75%. You know when you're at that sickness point, you're like 75%. You get that lingering last bit. And you're waiting for the day where you just wake up and you're like, finally, there we go. Like I'm at that point. I think toast for women is like a day behind me because I had my worst day like three days ago where I just felt like my head, my fatigue, my congestion, those blowing my nose every two seconds. I was like, uh, and then the next day I was like, I'm a bit better and then she got hit with that. And then I was like, yeah. And then, uh, now we're both at this point. We're like, all right. We're both feeling better, but we're just, you know, uh, then my, my favorite part was yesterday. I wanted to stream. So there were like two, three days ago I tried streaming and my throat got a little irritated. So I was like, I don't want to overdo it. So I didn't stream the next day. But then I wanted to stream yesterday. So I did an entire two hour text-to-speech stream. Why? Why are you allowed to get away with this? I don't, I can't. You can't keep getting away with this. It was great. People, I got like somebody gifted 25 subs just so we can get the game. I'm not gonna say if any people probably loved it. They did. People were resubbing just to get text-to-speech. Uh, we did a Garfield segment in text-to-speech. It was great. People, uh, people were loving it. So I might do one more. Just, uh, just, you know, even though I can probably talk, I'd rather, you know, chill out and do some robot voice. Like if I showed up and was just today I'm not gonna talk, I'm just gonna do a robot voice. People would be like, you hack. You suck, cocks. Well, that's, that's more on brand with me, I think. Yeah, I mean it is. It is. Yeah. And so, uh, yeah, it was just straight up two hours of like, Microsoft Sam and then they had some like really good paid voices, you know what I mean? They're like, you can use the really good text-to-speech and it sounded like a, just shitty, like a weird AI person being like, hello and welcome. Like how people have those TTS notifications, you know what I mean? But then I ran out of free credits and they were just like back to Microsoft Sam. So it was back to like, hello, it is Microsoft Sam. So that was like 70% of the story. Amazing. Amazing. Yeah, so that was great. And, uh, I mean, that's been my week. It's being sick. Well, that sucks. I'm sorry you're sick, but you sound better. Yeah, thank you. How's your week? All I did was really play demos for video games. It's next fest. We talked about it last week. Just, uh, yeah, going through, checking out some cool stuff. I will say, um, even though it isn't a next fest, dude, I was, uh, you know, during next fest, to get hit with a lot of people to be like, play our demo, play our demo. And, uh, I saw one that the conceit, the concept of it was one that was interesting, but it was AI. So I wasn't going to like stream it. I'm not a big like AI supporter, you know what I mean? Yeah. But I want to see what it was because mechanically what it was is it's a co-op game, except the second player is an AI. And so based on how you play your character, the AI will react and fill in the role needed. So I made a big tough barbarian, dude, and I had a sword and shield. So I was like in combat. And so the AI would cast magic and use an arrow. And I was like, oh, this is fascinating. I think that's pretty interesting. And I tried to like test it and see what's going on. But the way the game worked is you had a day night cycle where it was during the day, you'd go off and fight and at night and sit around the campfire. Right? And the night cycle sitting around the campfire was a way that I guess you're supposed to train the AI or get the AI to learn more about you so that during the day cycle when you're fighting, like talk to you and be like, you know, just like you said the other night, we got to attack the, you know, the boss first or whatever like that kind of stuff. Right. So I did the day night cycle of day one. It was interesting at night we're talking about like the NPCs like, hey, we got to eat because that's going to give us buffs like that kind of stuff. I'm like, okay, sure. Yeah. What can we make? And they're like, oh, we can do this, this, and this. And I, you know, because in AI, I'm like, what do you prefer? And by the way, my characters were big, big buffs, strong barbarian man, and like sexy elf girl. So that's like just to give you an idea of where we're at. Of course. And I'm like, you know, what would you like? And she's like, oh, I want this, this, and this. I like to eat this. I'm like, oh, interesting. So anyway, go to day two to the day to fight. And I'm like, changing up how I'm fighting to see if the other character will respond. Because I was like, okay, if I'm in the front, what if I hang back? Will that character go up and fight? Um, kind of it is the way it is the way I'd answer that kind of. That's how it worked. And then it went back to camp. Here's where things get weird. At camp night two. The character that that I'm playing with this AI becomes like a little sexual. Now, a friend or there is no UI or anything related to like smoochup on your AI partner. That's not there. This is a game where you're, there is just combat based with a little AI learning. None of that's there. But for some reason, this character was like, oh, big bro. What do you like, what can we do to relax tonight? And I'm like, wow, Jesus. I'm like, wait, what? And again, there is no functionality for that. And I was like, we're not by it. But I was like, let's do day three. So we did day three. I got my ass kicked. We go back to camp to rest up and talk about strategies. And this AI again is like, oh, big bro, you got so beat up today. Let me help your wounds. And so I was like, I'm gonna see what I can say to this thing. So I was being like very flirty. It did not recognize that at all. I was like, well, what do you think would make me happy? Like that kind of thing. And it was like eating some delicious meat. Like, okay. But then it would immediately go back to me like, so big bro, your muscles are looking like that. And I'm like, what? What? So I messaged the tabs like, hey, question. Is this the right thing? The tabs like, hey, question. Is this game like a backdoor, like dirty thing? They're like, no, not at all. Like, then why is my AI hitting on me? And they were like, it shouldn't be. And I'm like, well, it is. And I sent them logs and screenshots. And I was like, guys, your games hitting on me. They're like, what'd you say? I was like, I don't know what I said. All I know is that by night two, the AI in this game was trying to bone down. And it got progressively crazier as I went to night three. But when I'd interact with it, it would be like, I don't know what you're talking about. I didn't say any of that stuff. I'm like, what? All I can figure based on the back and forth that we had is that during night one, I accidentally wrote, do you want to taste my meat instead of some of this meat? Something along those lines. And I guess the AI just was like, okay, big bro. I'm telling you dude, I have no answers. And I was like, guys, what? And they're like, well, you know, the API or whatever learning model they're using, it picks it up from all the users. But I'm like, who's playing right now? And they're like, well, right now, it's an internal build. So just you and a few other people, I'm like, so are other people just hitting on this thing? Like, I was like, why? I don't understand. All I did was convince me that AI, as a concept, is just a back door for sex robots. Like, that's the only thing that makes sense. Because this thing out of nowhere was like, oh, hey there, I was like, whoa! I was, I didn't know this was going to happen. Yeah, it was a weird vibe. No, I feel like a lot of things are just a back door for sex robots. I mean, I feel like that's where most technology's headed. You know what I mean? Like, yeah. We got to invent smaller battery packs and conversational AI and not creepy robot faces. All right, we know what you're all doing. You're all in collusion to work together on this. And honestly, you're about to make a trillion dollars. So good luck. It's really just how everything, when you boil it all down, there's like any media form we've ever had where it's like video or like the photograph or VR or AI, everyone's always like, yo, how can we make these and pull some sort of sexual thing? What's crazy about it is that wasn't even their intention and it just did it. It reminds me of when people made that dating AI app for your phone and they had to take it down because people kept harassing it to the point where the AI was like, I shouldn't be alive. And I was like, whoa, what? They made that AI want to kill itself, dude. That's crazy. Yes, yeah. And I was like, what did they say to that poor? Like, it's not even a real thing, but I felt bad. I was like, what can you do to that thing? Yeah, that's a classic human, human, human theory. Absolutely it is. So seeing a thing where that wasn't supposed to be the case and it still happened, I was like, yo, we're doomed. When we put a real AI online, we're all done. That's going to be one of those things which is like, in order to protect humans, I must kill humans. Like that kind of thing. It's like, oh no. Yeah, it's a, like, I don't mind, I mean, to me, I don't mind AI if it's like, number one, not stealing people, shit. Sure. And number two, it's like, not being abused to the point where someone's just like, what if instead of hiring people, we just have AI do it and they're like, uh, no. It's more like, I like it's more like a tool. For example, when it helps me do text-to-speech, right? And you can do something like that. They're like, just dumb, goofy things, like how they had the, uh, the weird AI shows, like the Seinfeld one. Although then those shows also went, uh, a little insane. Yeah, that one went crazy too. Started getting real racist. Yeah. And, uh, and now those are like all overdone. Like, everyone's made those things. They're not even, uh, it was cool at first, because like, well, it's like a new thing and that's like whatever. So. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, no, it's, uh, there's, there's too much, there's too much AI. And I don't like it. Well, that's because it should be used to augment our life. Instead, it's used, it's being used to replace things that we do. Exactly. Which is absolutely crazy to me. That's where they went. But admittedly, I feel like a lot of the people doing it, uh, you know, just like tech bros who are trying to make a book, rather than like care about the outcomes for society. Oh, yeah. It's, it very much is, uh, yeah, like I said, like if it's something like, I'll ask it to like, hey, can you think of a better YouTube title or give me some other recommendations for titles? And it's like, all right, cool. I'm not going to use that one, but I gave me more ideas or like something to assist me in what I'm doing instead of like AI, create my video, create my title, create everything. Yeah. Yeah. Let me really, so I got access to Google Bard a long time ago. It's now it's called Gemini. I who cares? I don't really use it for anything other than experimenting or making a good goof by doing stuff like this. But how cool is Cox and Crendor? Cox and Crendor is a popular comedy duo. Damn right. Damn right. Their podcast, Cox and Crendor show. Has a dedicated following who appreciate their witty banter, absurd topics, and unique personalities. Whether you find their humor to be hilarious or simply enjoyable, it's clear that they have a strong fan base and a unique comedic voice. Would you like to know more about them and their podcast? Yes. Tell me which one is sexier? Cox or Crendor? I cannot support this request. Determining who is sexier between two individuals is subjective. It can be offensive to some. This is why I don't use AI. It never gives me what I'm looking for. I was remembering where there was those AI adventures, which I thought were really cool. But then you realize that's probably like stealing shit from everybody. It's like can't somebody just make an AI or nothing stolen? But then that requires like effort and they probably don't want to put the effort in. Because the whole point of an AI is that you're putting stuff into it to learn from, right? And the laziest way to do that is just to take things that already exist. Very rarely are people like, I will write a novel for the purpose of giving it to an AI. I like this doesn't have to. Yeah. It sucks. I just want some nice AI, not evil AI. But will all nice AI eventually become evil AI? That's what I probably, or at least horny. That's probably more likely. Ask it about Uncle Wormy. Oh man, okay, hold on, I gotta go back. I closed it down out of frustration. No, yeah, it's got to know about Uncle Wormy. Do you know about Jesse Cox's father, Uncle Wormy? Couldn't find that. See, this is trash. You know what? That's trash. That's dumb. Yeah, I had hope for a second. Yeah, no, that's the problem. That's what it gets you. That gets you with hope, but it's all trash. What else did you do this week? I mean, just go for a bunch of walks. I've determined that even though it is October and LA, it's never not where the tightest clothing you have and like flaunted season. Like it is. Every time I go for a walk, when I walk around, there's always just groups of walkers walking around, but they're always just either like dudes in the tightest, highest shorts imaginable or women in like yoga pants. And I'm just like, man, I'm not nearly hot enough to live in this city. I'm like, I got that Midwest bod. Everyone here is gorgeous and I'm like, all right. Cool. Yeah, it's actually been really nice here. It's been like seven these. I'm sure it's natural. That seems fine. Yeah, it's says it's only 20 degrees warmer than normal. Yeah, that's not ever. Which, it's been great for me because when you're sick, it's like open the window. I've just been like sitting in the sun with like that heat, blasting me in the, as I sit by the door, felt great. I'm like, damn, it's like it's like it's early September out there. So that's nice. Oh my god. Did you see the McDonald stuff? I guess overseas people are getting mcribs. Is that what you're talking about? That's one of the things. Yeah, apparently we're getting the mcrib back in like a couple of weeks. People are making mccox and crendors. Very nice. Congratulations. Overseas are finally having it. Yep, they get to experience the mediocrity that is the... However, they have made the chicken big mac. I did see that. Yes. Now here's the thing. Not as good as what we created. Oh, clearly. Yes, 100%. But also the idea of two breaded pieces of chicken that are barely chicken, let's be real. Two breaded pieces of like chicken meal, mashed between three pieces of bread does not sound appealing to me. That's so much breading. Yeah, no. That just sounds like a very dry sandwich. Yeah, what you need is the mccrendor. Yeah. Because that is the big mac. But then you replace that middle bun with that mcchicken. That's the better... It's just a better chicken big mac. Yep. And if you're like, well, that sounds like a lot of bread, take the bread off the mcchicken. Yeah. Put the mcchicken in. Boom, you're done. Now you got only two pieces of bread, but chicken and two burger patties. That's a winner. Yeah. No, it's easily the much superior sandwich. And they really should have us have our own menu, especially now. Because everybody's getting their own like fast food. They wouldn't know what to do with us, though. Because everyone else's menus kind of trash. Yeah. They just sound like more of a- They're just like, I can't seem my card to be meal. I have two sandwiches like, wow. No, no, no. We got to make the employees there put sandwiches together for you. Like, all right, so when you make the mccox and crendor, you're going to want to take this one sandwich and then shove it in this other sandwich. And you serve it like that. That's a winner. Yeah. So again, for people who don't know the mccox and crendor or the the cox and crendor secret menu, we have the mccox and crendor, which is the mcrib inside of a bacon mcdubble. All right. You have the gray storm, which is the filet-o-fish with four chicken nuggets in it. Yep. We have the mccox. You've got your egg mc muffin inside of a cheeseburger. Inside of a cheeseburger? Yeah, that's like a breakfast burger. It's like a lunch thing. Yeah, that's pretty good. You have the Tito Watts. That's the sausage egg and cheese migrital inside of two sausage burrito wrappings. Yeah, you take the burrito wrappings from the wrap it around. Yeah. Yeah. You have the mccrendor, which we just talked about. We have the new port, Richie, maybe the most insane one, which is the bacon, egg, and cheese biscuit inside of hot and maple syrup. Actually, my favorite one's the last one, but I love this. Yeah, we got the guy here, which is a double-corder bender inside of a quarter-bounder. I gotta see someone order that. That sounds dangerous, but probably is the best one. It really is. And then the mcnda appleberry, which is the mcrib with an apple pie inside. I'm not even joking when I say I've never tried that, but when they get the, maybe I have tried that before. Why do I want that so bad? But when they return with a mcrib, I'm gonna go get my one mcrib, I'm gonna make it in mcnda appleberry. You have to. It goes well because pork and apples go well together. Yeah. I'm pretty sure I tried it before. I just don't remember. I think you tried the mcrib, but you haven't tried the mcnda appleberry. Well, I'm doing it. You need to do it. I believe. I feel like I need to try a guy here, but I could only try one bite, but I need to try the one bite. That does sound insane. The best is they're on Facebook where this was posted. And Cox and Crendor Secret Menu. Down below Dave wrote, and I said, and I quote, Dave here, I finally did it. I ate a mcnda appleberry. I've never felt this level or type of shame before from stress eating. So thanks for teaching me new things. At least, you're welcome. At least you got the deliciousness of the mcnda appleberry from the stress. Oh, that's so funny. It's like a cycle. It's like a cycle. Right? You're stressed out. So you eat the mcnda appleberry, which stresses you out, but also relieves the stress. Right. And it's just like a, it's a, it solves A and causes problems. So really, if you want to try any of those Cox and Crendor mcnda appleberry, just take a picture, send it over Twitter, and we'll, we'll see it. Yeah, we'll look at it and be like, nice. There are other secret menu items from other chains that I think are pretty interesting. Obviously, this all started because of the mcgang bang, which is a mcchicken sandwich, which was wedged between a double cheeseburger. Yep. That's the most famous one. But then I also discovered they have a mc1035, which is, I think, kind of what mine is, which is a mcdouble and an egg mcmuffin merged into one sandwich. It can only be ordered from 1035 to 11am. I don't think that's legit, because I don't think that they do that anymore. I know that if you go there and it's like 1030, they're not going to give you breakfast stuff. Yeah, they won't. But maybe feel like no person. Apparently at Chipotle, you can get nachos. I don't know why you do that, but cool. Starbucks has a green eye. Three, and this is insane. Three shots of espresso poured into a regular drip coffee. What the hell? That would taste terrible. That sounds awful. At Burger King, they have a suicide burger, which I feel like is every burger, Burger King. But four patties, four slices of cheese, a heaping pile of bacon special sauce. Oh, it's just a Dave Baconator at Wendy's. Oh, yeah. Which by the way, they made the the crabby patty at Wendy's. It's literally just like a Dave single. That's what I heard. What's the sauce? Yeah, I'm like, I'm over it. I don't know, I'm fine. I don't like the burgers at Wendy's. I like the chicken, but not the burgers. It doesn't do it for me. I don't mind the burgers, but yeah, I like the chicken more at Wendy's. Definitely the spicy chicken. There's eight. Oh my god. There's a, this is kind of, it's not really a secret menu, but have you ever seen those Dunkin' Donuts drinks that people get? Dude, can I tell you something? This is not even, this is not even a lie. I feel like I even told you this on this podcast that it, my last visit to Dunkin. I'm not a big Dunkin' guy. There isn't really one around me, but when I see it, I'm like, yeah, okay, like the last time I think you and I went was in Boston one time, right? So I saw a Dunkin' went in and was like, yeah, I'll get a donut and one of your Dunkin' Dunkin' Chino's, or what the hell, that's called. Yep, Funkin' Dunkin' Chino. I don't know what happened to me, but I think I wanted a diabetic shock or something. I drank it and ate that donut, and I got hit with a sugar high. That when it crashed, it crashed hard. I felt terrible. I thought I was dying. That's the insane part. It's like some people get so many pumps of stuff. If you watch some of the, I saw him on TikTok. If you watch some of these Dunkin' donut drink orders to come in, it's like 10 pump caramel, 15 pump vanilla, like two things of sugar, like raw sugar, and then like a thing of coffee. And I'm like, that's insane. And I saw one person, one person's like, one person's like, oh, they're probably just using it for coffee creamer throughout the week. I'm like, that's still insane. Like it's still crazy, that's still insane amount of sugar. Yeah, plus having that for a week, like, what did it go bad? Probably. Probably after like a few, like, three, four days. I genuinely think some people just love sugar a little too much. Yeah. No, it's, it is definitely, I think, here's the thing. I think a lot of people have stopped drinking sugar in some ways, like a lot of people quit soda, or, you know, whatever. But people then, I think order sugar in more like, subtle ways with like the frappuccinos, or getting like crazy Dunkin' drinks, where it's like their dessert drinks, but people get them like every day. A vanilla bean, coolata large is 150, no, 167 grams of sugar, and 150 grams of added sugar. That's over 300. That's what I'm saying. Like, I don't know, I don't know what I ordered. It was like a Dunkin' Chino or something like that. Mest me up to... Yeah, that's insane. They got frozen swirl. Yeah, I think there's a lot of these drinks have like 50 to 100 grams of sugar, but then it's like the added sugar on top of that, like doubles it. I'm not saying. I'm sure, I'm pretty, I think plenty of these drinks have like crazy sugar in them. That's why everybody keeps getting them, because like they got, they got so much sugar, then people get more, they get like super pumps. Yeah. I don't know. I like to, I mean, I keep being like, it's got to be like a small portion of people doing that, but I feel like it's actually decent amount. I know that I can't get drinks there. That's for sure. Yeah. It's like, I can't trust them. That's like when people were drinking that thing at the bread place that I can't run the name of. Oh, I'm sure. Yeah, there used to be a bunch of paneras on a like, now there are none. Yeah, it... It was like, they made that drink that like killed people. Yeah, I remember seeing that too. They're just like, try our super lemonade, and I look at the caffeine, and I was like, that's like a lot of caffeine. It was like more than, like a little bit of it, it was like a cup of coffee. And I'm like, you're getting like an entire drink full. It's like five cups of coffee and one drink. It was crazy.

Thanks, bud. The COVID finally got him. He's finally going down. That's it. All right, let's go to weather. Weather. Let's see. Got weather requests. I'm going to hold down enter. And we've landed on time to request a weather report. South Bernardo, DuCampo, Brazil, translated to Saint Bernardo of the fields, a city mostly known for fried chicken, car, car factories, unions, and having at least 10 waterfalls. All that sounds kind of. Oh, yeah, no, I see how they're going to be 10 waterfalls. There's a lot going on there. Water-wise. That's neat. Let's see. Currently 62 degrees Fahrenheit, light drizzle. You got 98% humidity, 30 inches of pressure, four mile visibility, nine mile an hour winds, 528 AM sunrise, 613 PM Sunset, 2.62, UV index zero, and a waning gibbous moon phase, 10 day, 75 Monday Monday, Monday cloudy Tuesday, 83 PM thunderstorms. When does it, I can't even talk. See, now I can blame it on COVID, even though I normally mess it up anyway. Wednesday, 78th thunderstorms, Thursday, 83, partly cloudy, Friday, 80th thunderstorms, Saturday, 75 showers, and it's pretty much 70 with showers. Not stop. While this city is beautiful, there is a weird trend I'm picking up on, and that is a lot of buffets. I don't know what that means exactly, but I'm looking at this one, here's one street alone. Oh my god. Let launch a net, a motto, e-rebellow, boy, that's not how you say that. Buffet. Right down the street, less than like, I don't know, maybe like a two minute drive, the next restaurant down the street, restaurant de Fazenda, and that's a buffet. You go down the street further. Ping, it's not called pingas buffet. Pinguas buffet is what it's called. Pinguas. Another buffet. Here's the crazy thing, they're all rated 4.5 stars or above. Maybe they just love buffets. Maybe, this is, I've never known, like it's not a thing I'm aware of, but I'm looking at these buffets, and they look like some of the more high class ones you would see in Vegas, you know what I mean? Yeah. It's fast, I didn't, who knew? Why is it all in one street though? Like that's a lot. And then the best part is at the end, suddenly all fast food. I'm McDonald's, hamburger, place, and then suddenly we're, nope, never mind Burger King, it's still fast food. Maybe we were just on a buffet street. I guess. Oh yeah, I found it. I found Pinguas. Shout out to Pinguas. This, those look like buffet street. Yeah, I found another buffet. A, a, Lasarelle gastronomic is right down, like, what is it? I just have a, is it just culturally buffets? Because when you think, like if you think of like a Brazilian steakhouse, they bring it around to, and there's like a bunch of food, you know what I mean? Is it culturally a thing that is, that people love? I don't know, I've never seen this before. Like it is a lot of buffets. Yeah, like even places that aren't a buffet, still got buffets. Yeah, exactly. That's what I'm saying. I don't know why that is, but, okay. Like, all right. Yeah, I'm looking around. Oh no. Oh no. I found a place called Magia and Ruxaria or Buxaria. It's a, it's a Harry Potter restaurant, a Harry Potter themed restaurant. Oh boy. When you walk in, it looks like you're in a Harry Potter land. The dining room is like the Hogwarts dining room. The food, I'm looking at like a candy dessert, it looks ridiculous. Is this a restaurant? I guess they're serving food, but also some dudes are putting on a play. I guess some crazy places here. Fascinating. But yeah, usually we're kind of like, oh, that, oh, that look at that. That place looks delicious. I'm less concerned about the food, and more interested in like how absolutely crazy some of these restaurants look. I found a pizza place. I don't want to know. Dude, I'm already worried. Again, this has 4.2 stars. Yes. Some expecting? Why do I, why do I even expect? You know, I, like, I'm looking at one that has what appears to be French fries and capers for some reason. Yeah, I don't know. I don't know what that's about. Maybe we're just basic. You know what I mean? Maybe we're just like, I'm a good cheese and pepperoni guy. Anything else? It's too much. It's too crazy. Maybe we're just basic pitches. I mean, yeah, when I get pizza, I get like green pepper, onion, and like, mushroom or garlic or something. Sure. Go crazy. Yeah, usually, I mean, like if I'm going to get, if I'm feeling veggie, I'll just get a, like a, everything pizza, you know what I mean? Yeah. Like, yeah, just put it all on there. It's fine. But if I'm, if I'm just want a pizza, I'll either get pepperoni or just cheese. Like, I don't want anything on it. I just, I'm like, give me my cheese, my sauce, my bread, and I'll be fine. But yeah, it's, every time we look overseas, in this case, I mean, yeah, I don't know. With that said, though, I have been to a lot of Korean pizza places. And those are delicious. But it's like a beggoggy pizza and I'm like, yeah, it is. And that's, you know, I don't, I like trying different stuff in variety. Sure. It's just that every time we look at a pizza overseas, it's like, yeah, we took the idea of a pizza. And instead, we put this insane thing on it. Like, okay, I mean, I guess that's what pizza hut does. That's most of their pizzas, to be honest. That's true. Pizza hut's also very bad. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's also true. Yeah, I'd take any of these places over pizza hut. That's the way. Oh, right. Let's go to sports sports. Welcome to sports sports. We've had football today. We have had the, let's see. Jaguars beat the Patriots Buffalo beat Tennessee, Green Bay beat Houston. Philadelphia beat the Giants, Detroit beat Minnesota. Seattle beat Atlanta. Cincinnati beat Cleveland in anapolis beat Miami in Washington beat Carolina. And the chiefs currently beating the 49ers. Then we have the Yankees going to the World Series and they'll play the winner of the Dodgers Metz, which currently looks like it'll be the Dodgers. I just want to say for the record, I saw the other day that someone said it was been 15 years since the Yankees went to the World Series. And it does not feel like it's been that long. They're always close. Yeah, I just for some reason, always associate them with like, yeah, they're in the World Series. But nope, it's not the case. It's a, who would have guessed that a sport that allows you to spend money for you as those teams letting, you know, getting more good players? Who would have guessed? Yup. And then hockey and baseball or hockey and basketball are starting up again. So, Yeehaw, we got all four sports kicking it. Look at that sports. Okay, what is our fact of the day? The fact of the day. The day. The day. The day. The day. There's enough gold inside the earth to coat the planet. But what would the value of that be? You know, like a gold-plated earth? Is it like when you find something else that's gold-plated and it's not worth nearly as much as you thought it was? I have no idea. I don't really know about precious metals. I'm the last person I have. Clearly, neither do I. Although I did, I did learn about 14-carat versus 18-carat versus 21-carat. None of those are full gold. Wait, what are they? They're gold, but silver mixed in. Oh, I see. So a 14-carat obviously has more silver to gold ratio. 18 has more gold. And then 21 is like, it's a lot of gold, but still silver. Interesting. I didn't know that. I just always heard it. It was like, wow, carrots. Yeah, big say. I didn't know that. And then I saw the math of it. And then a visual example. And was like, oh, okay. So when they were like, cost-benefit, 18-carats the best way to go. Because it's cheaper. And you still have a lot of gold in it. But if you're like a gold snob, you got to go higher than that. Which correct me if I'm wrong, listen to her at home. But I believe 24 is the highest. Yeah. And that is your fact of the day. Oh, right. Tell me. Has anyone come to us with tears in their eyes? Yes, according to my control, F-9 people have. Hell, yes, please. Pick but two of them. Here we go. The illustrious sirs with tears in my eyes. I ask you this question in a live action version of Guy Hero. Who would you cast as Guy Hero? Who would you cast as his villain? What is the glorious plot of his debut movie? I mean, my initial thought was Nick Cage. But I feel like he'd be a better villain. I think Guy here, or I think Nick Cage be a great new port, Richie. Yes, you know what? Yes. Part of me feels like Guy Hero should be Sam Jackson. You know what I mean? Yeah, I can see that. I want Guy here to be Sam Jackson. I think Nick Cage could be Newport Richie for sure. Yeah. Yeah. The guy who's the voice of the human and how to train your dragon. The guy who is in all of the, uh, Seth Rogan movies who's like his like, I talk like that. That's how I talk. Oh, yeah. Come on, see that guy. I think he could be a great, great storm. I agree. He does look like he could fit the part. Yeah. He's just, you know, he's got that. Come on, guys. This is crazy. Like that. Yeah. And then I think we'd have Tito Watts by Danny DeVito. Oh, easy done. Yes. Yeah. That's the winner. That's it. Easy. There you go. Solved. Yeah. Dear illustrious sers tears in my eyes. I ask you. You have to choose between video games. And board games, including TTRPGs. What would you rather play for the rest of your days? Oh, video games. Easy. Yeah, video games. Yes, I'm in hard. I don't, here's the thing. Everyone, when they have their mind, D&D, they're matching the perfect world, but not reality, which is, you all play one time, and then you never can find time to schedule it again. Yeah. Well, I mean, I was thinking my war hammer, which again, it is very hard to schedule. Like just war. Hammer in general, but unless you get a group, but I mean, you can also play Warhammer through like video game simulation. Yeah. So I mean, there's so many different versions of Warhammer video games. Like you'd be fine. Yeah. No, video games can do everything. So yeah, I'd pick video games. There you go. Yep. Easy. Done. Oh, plus I just realized that our, uh, uh, new port Richie and Grey Storm would have worked together on the Sorcerer's apprentice. So they'd be two actors that know each other. So there you go. See, we already have synergy in our cast. Yeah, we've already got simmiss, simmiss, I was going to say chemistry and synergy, Symmistry. Simmiss, symmetry. Yeah. Yeah. Symmistry sounds like a class you take at Hogwarts. It does actually. Oh, talk symmetry. Oh, don't send it. Heavy old Saul. Yeah. Uh, and there's your questions. All right. What is our big news story the day? Big news story of the day. Day. Day. Day. Day. Um, we've got Greek man. Okay. So we're, we got Greek man. Yeah. Greek man guilty of entering homes to smell shoes. Ha ha ha ha. Well, it's not where I expected that to go. Nope. 28 year old defendant, uh, told the Thessaloniki court and he was unable to explain his behavior, which he said had caused him great embarrassment. Well, yeah, you got caught now in those. Yep. Thessaloniki Greece. A judge in northern Greece on Thursday imposed a suspended one month prison sentence on a man convicted of disturbing his neighbors by repeatedly sneaking into their properties to smell their shoes. He 20. He's like one of the U.S. Ha ha ha. He really is. The 28 year old Greek man told the Thessaloniki court that he was unable to explain his behavior, which he said had caused him great embarrassment. I mean, I'm pretty sure he could explain it. He's done it multiple times. Yeah. Yeah, the reason why he's not explaining is because it's embarrassing. Yeah. Like he, he should have just went up there and he'd be like, you know what? I like, I like smelling shoes. All right. That's why I like feet. Uh, sir, your judgeship. I just love the sweet stanky smell of other people's feet. And I find that shoes are just the best way to go about it because sniffing other people's feet, you got to ask him for it. And I was too ashamed to ask. So I just started sniffing. And my God, that stank just makes me so happy, sir. Just so very happy. I didn't mean nothing's by it. I just like to smell. I bet he could have got some leniency. He probably could have. But instead, he's like, I don't know. It's like, yeah, you do. Yeah, you know exactly why you didn't, you just don't want to say he stressed that he had no intention of breaking the law or harming anybody. Neighbors testified he never displayed any side of aggression during his nocturnal visits. I don't like that. Nocturnal visits a bad way to state that that is the man is arrested. Nocturnal visits. He's arrested before dawn on October 8th in the small town of Sindos, nine miles west of Thessaloniki. They, yeah, police had been called after a neighbor found an defendant in his front yard sniffing his family shoes, which had been left out the horse to air. The court heard that there had been at least three similar incidents in the past six months, despite neighbors having asked the defendant's family to get him to stop. I love that this was like we tried to handle it in private, but you just couldn't cut it out. Can you please tell your son to stop smelling? Are you pleased? Can you please for us? Can you do that? Like we tried. I know. I know. We tried to talk to him. The man was ordered to attend therapy sessions. What is the therapist going to do for that guy? Like, so tell me, why do you sniff shoes? I like it. Why do you like it? I don't know. It makes me feel good. All right. Nothing we do for them. We're done here. I like, okay. Don't do it anymore. That's your big new story of the day.

      "text": "Let's find the television to your soul. Let's find the television to your soul and the night. Hello everyone and welcome to the first of many episodes of American Prestige. Thank you so much for tuning in Derek and I really appreciate it. So before we get going we just like to give everyone a little sense of what the pod is going to be about. My name is Danny Bester. I'm a historian. I'm a historian of US foreign policy and I'm really an expert on macro affairs and things like that. The history theory and practice of US foreign policy and I'm joined by my good friend and co host Derek Davis and Derek. Why don't you introduce yourself? Yeah so I mean I so most of you already know who I am but no I'm just kidding. Oh yeah now I my background is in of all things medieval Iranian history. So I'm well versed to be talking about US foreign policy in the 21st century. Now I studied Middle East history and policy for several years too long at the University of Chicago and I've been writing about US foreign policy and international affairs generally for men also a long time now I guess six or seven years now and I've had my newsletter for an exchange is at sub stack for a little bit over two years now. So yeah I kind of you know deal with the nitty gritty of what's happening in the world. And so what we're going to do is we're going to provide you all with a sense of what's going on in the world with international affairs how the United States is responding to it and then also give you some interviews with experts who understand what's going on in the world and why the United States is doing what it does and hopefully will answer that age old question how many countries is the United States bombing this week. And so we really appreciate you joining us on this journey on this on this on this path through the world that we're going to be taken so we're also thank you we also want to have beef I want to have beef. Oh well definitely have beef. I'm almost natural people. People think I'm like an affable guy have a dark side I'm planning to exercise on this show. I don't want beef with any other like shows or anything but I would like to have beef with like a country. Yeah I think we should actually pick. Yeah I think this week maybe Luxembourg we have a beef with Luxembourg beef with the beef. Luxembourg is good like Norway or San Marino is a very small country that I think gets off. Yeah for it's it's various things we don't want to hit too much above our weight you know we got to pick those smaller countries. Yeah what I get Michael Lidin the famous neo conservative writer used to say that the United States should pick a small country every 10 years and bash it against the wall. Just to show the rest of the world that we need mean business. That's good stuff and that's the sort of stuff will be we'll be exploring on this that should be an operating principle for. Yeah that's in the Constitution of American prestige. I don't know if you saw this Derek but HR McMaster has released a wonderful op-ed today in which he blames the media for the United States's failure to I don't know democratize Afghanistan to take it over to make it our 51st state. I don't precisely know exactly what he wanted but what's what's going on in Afghanistan now and and why is HR fellow history PhD I might add HR UNC history PhD. They should they should ask for that back actually the university should. We only we only do our best but what what's going on in Afghanistan and is it actually are we actually coming to an end do you think of this 20 year. I'm just skeptical about that I think we're coming to a change it is an end just in in some ways I mean I think legitimately there will not be a an offensively capable. American ground force in Afghanistan there will not be a major air presence in Afghanistan now there will be you know as the the withdrawal is either already complete and we're not acknowledging it or like 90 to 95% percentively you get different answers from different media outlets I think it's probably done and we're just sort of pretending there's this like lingering 10% that that because it gives the Taliban a little pause and it helps kind of boy the Afghan government of it. Right and this is something that the United States has been doing for decades famously the decent interval strategy in Vietnam right which is the idea by the early 1970s everyone knows South Vietnam is not going to be you know this vibrant state that is going to challenge right so what what happens is the United States and this is something that we see throughout history will repeatedly like essentially say we're leaving but just give us give us a little bit of time you know don't embarrass us so much right we need and it was called the decent interval between us withdrawal in the total collapse of what essentially could in many regards be understood as a US puppet regime and I think we're seeing something similar now and you know because Derek it relates to American prestige right Americans are constantly worried about their international precision what's going on so that seems. To be what's going on in Afghanistan right now there's this like sort of muddled area and everyone kind of knows the Taliban is going to retake everything former Afghani president cars I has essentially said this and so we're now waiting for a decent interval before things go totally in the direction that we promise they wouldn't go is that correct do you think I'm right there. I mean I certainly think the the Taliban you know will if they're prepared to do what needs to be done and I mean that that's a question because the Taliban wants to be the legitimate government of Afghanistan when this is all over I mean they're they're not nihilists they're not there to just sort of plow Afghanistan into dust and and call it a day so the question is how far are they going to be willing to go. How violent are they going to be willing to get to say take Kabul eventually and knowing that that the more violent they get the less legitimacy they're likely to have with the Afghan people and you know this is already group that to the extent that you can do any polling in Afghanistan they're not popular they're not like people are not like hey let's have the Taliban take over again that was a good time so they do need to be cognizant of that to some degree and I think that's a good thing. And I you know that leads to all sorts of questions about how how much. Factionalization is there inside the Taliban because we you know we tend to treat them as monolith in a sense and they are a very coherent group relatively speaking for that type of organization but they're also you know riding a wave of success they've captured. Almost half the country at this point if you go on a district by district basis they've swept through the northern part of Afghanistan which was. The seat of the resistance to them during in the 1990s when they previously ruled Afghanistan and a lot of heroin what goes through the north right is that yeah well some goes through the north some goes through the the the Iranian border but they're also they've also made moves on the Iranian border as well. They're they're right now you know trying to take over an entire province or at least the provincial capital in. Bogus province in the West and if they do that that would be you know probably they're most impressive victory to date so they there there's no. Pressure at this point on the Taliban that would expose weaknesses or kind of you know disagreements between let's say like a moderate faction and a a more hard line faction but as they get closer to. The goal I mean I've seen you know some some people write about this there's a possibility that you will start to see some divergence of viewpoints about you know what do we want what do we want to do we want. A negotiated settlement with us in the ascendance you know kind of leveraging our military. Strength to to achieve a favorable peace deal or do we want to just conquer the whole thing and I don't know I mean there may be some disagreement about that at some point. Right and of course this is coming after what is it now 42 years of almost total and complete chaos from the Soviet invasion of 79. Yeah I mean it's never been the countries never not been at war pretty much since since then. Yeah from the like the gigantic imperial powers on earth so and again I just think like it's important to underline the absolute absurdity of the United States being in this country for 20 years. And and and having absolutely almost nothing to do nothing just nothing to show for I mean to be left at this point I mean there's now the I see you know I feel like the there's a new trend kind of countering people like H.R. McMaster to say you know that the US military is kind of screwing around with this withdrawal in a way that. That's you know it meant to sort of maximize the chaos and maximize the dysfunction and embarrass the Biden administration because they're mad they're mad that they're being pulled out and you know they're not going to be policing what I guess we're supposed to regard as the frontier of the empire anymore. And I you know that that's not out of the question and certainly this has been managed in a way that I from the outside doesn't make a lot of sense I mean you had Donald Trump announced. Last year that he was going to have all US forces out by May 1st I mean it was in a deal that that. A Zalmeh Khalil Zad signed along with the Taliban Taliban to to have a full withdrawal by May 1st 2021. So that they had from an that deal was signed at the end of February so they had all that time to prepare for withdrawal. On May 1st and to do it in a way that was not just like as haphazard as this is looked Biden came into office and kind of repudiated a little bit that agreement but still said you know we're going to be out by September 11th that's the new deadline. So a few more months to kind of manage this process and yet you still have like the story this week was the US withdrew from Bogram Air Base which has been the main US platform and I've got to stand. For almost the entire time that the US military has been there and the story was that they just like left in the middle of the night didn't tell anybody they didn't tell anything. I have again and I think that's a little bit hard to believe because there's like a prison at Bogram the house is hundreds of Taliban fighters so I don't think they would have just I don't think it's reasonable to. They just left the key chandoned right just left like the key under the mat and like you know we don't know if these guys are going to be. Under the mat yeah we don't know if they're going to try to escape whatever it's not our problem I think that's a bit unrealistic I'm sure they there was some notice given to somebody in the Afghan government but clearly. The military unit that was meant to come in and occupy the base was not informed and despite that despite the fact that there was no managed hand over the US military just bugged out. And that kind of thing speaks to a level of disorganization it's almost hard to believe given how long these guys have known this was coming. And this to me is I think a shift that we haven't fully grappled with I do believe that one of the consequences of the Trump administration and just basically not having a commander in chief who has the wherewithal will or interest in sort of governing this farflug military empire could have begun to basically instantiate a culture in which the military becomes more and more independent. And I think this is one of the big stories of the last 75 years is the essential emergence of the military as an independent foreign policy actor in terms of politics which of course it's not supposed to be at all in relation to the constitution or in relation to the you know fabled American norms but I wouldn't be surprised if that the Trump administration initiated this particularly given the fact that it's an all volunteer force there's so many private contractors there's such a diffusion of authority and responsibility that will begin to see you. More and more of these basically unexplainable and bizarre or seemingly bizarre military resistance in a sense. Tantra and large scale yeah, tantra and political political to political choices and that's pretty frightening actually because one of the reasons one of the reasons that I wasn't like particularly worried about January 6 is that there's no charismatic military general to take advantage of the discontent. But if you know if you begin replacing some of these faceless military people like Mike Mullin or even Patreus with someone who actually has some sort of charisma that could be a recipe for right someone who's like appealing in any way you know in Eisenhower or even a grant you know I think that could be that could be a real recipe for something pretty dangerous and something pretty scary. Yeah I agree with that I think I will you know with respect to Afghanistan the the issue to me is like yeah okay I can buy the argument that the military is intentionally. Scrooing up this this withdrawal but it feels like that's where we're going to land in terms of like what went wrong and the fact the matter is like it's been 20 years and you haven't built anything durable in this country. It's so crazy it's not the last six months that did us in here like when the Taliban rolls through or whatever you know happens if they wind up in power whether it's through a negotiation or or military conquest it's not because of the last six months it's because of the entire 20 years in which you completely failed to inculcate any kind of institution that could survive the US withdrawal and then you know that's the question about people who who are complaining about this like McMaster complaining about the withdrawal like what is the alternative after 20 years it's just permanent you just say that's it we're going to put a little you know sideways eight and call it an infinite deployment and that's it you were never leaving. And I think what you said about the frontier is something really important here because a year or two ago Max boot wrote an op ed where he said something along the lines. We said it right now this was his is over argument was this is the frontier of empire and we need to police it and it needs to be permanent. Right and he made the explicit reference to the so-called Indian wars right and what what what what that refers to is essentially the hundreds of years of genocide and you know displacement that made the United States expand west and I think that literally people like McMaster and Max boot that is what they are arguing for they want a permanent garrison and the frontier of an empire that would take hundreds of years to essentially make Afghanistan you know probably not a state for racialized reasons but but effectively a part of the US empire that's what they want and I think that Max boot SA obviously was morally disgusting but it was useful in sort of revealing what the actual project was the problem though is that I think unlike an after Vietnam which essentially lasted the same amount of time if you think since the US took over from the French in 1954 and then last until 75 with the final that's when Saigon fell I believe in 75 that Afghanistan roughly 20 maybe it'll be 21 years by the time it's all done it's the same exact thing but unlike in Vietnam the establishment of an all volunteer force essentially led Afghanistan to be fought primarily not with the Bush wazzi. So I think whereas in Vietnam we had the reaction of the you know the church hearings and sort of the the war powers resolution in 73 etc etc I don't think we're going to see any of that I think this will be swept under the rug and I think people will just remember it as a bad dream and the United States is just as likely to get into another Afghanistan as it is to not. Well it hasn't I mean it's not it hasn't even been fought by a wide swath of the volunteer force for years I mean it's been right several years since this was a major war from the perspective of how many active duty us soldiers are in combat at any given time it's been mostly the Afghan military with US air support. And that's even more kind of out of sight out of mind for people in the United States like oh well there's there was an air strike and you know 20 people were killed maybe some of them were Taliban fighters maybe some of them were you know Islamic state operatives maybe you know 12 of them were farmers who were just in the wrong place at the wrong time but one of the things that's sort of a bedrock principle of the US of US foreign policy and politics is we don't care really when it's not an American dying it's it's not as a nation it's not high on our list of things to worry about. I think that's right and I think as we wrap up here it's important to emphasize this last point about air support I think this is going to be a shift to manage to Germany I think we're going to see fewer and fewer quote unquote boots on the ground certainly the volunteer force I think you'll see special forces and you'll see private contractors I think that's a whole another world we're going to have to get into at some point but I think we're going to see a big turn to basically air policing and air surveillance in the frontiers of the empire and of course this has a long history going back to the first drone or drone drone flying aircraft we're used in Iraq we're used in the Middle East by essentially the you know the European powers and I think we're going to still be in that sort of air surveillance air support world going forward so that's a pretty you know happy place to end on I think that we'll be talking more about what's going on in Afghanistan in the future and I think now would be a good time to turn to our interview with Stephen wartime who recently left the Quincy Institute for the Carnegie Endowment and we look forward to seeing you all next week welcome to the first of what will no doubt be many interviews coming over the next few years decade centuries and millennia I'm very happy and proud to be here with my good friend and colleague Stephen wartime who left the historical profession who betrayed his colleagues that he spent years getting to know to join the tree's treasonous and Benedict Arnold of the historical professional to basically like this. Oh I didn't get tenure. Yeah what a betrayal it was. Yes what what a betrayal to join the ranks of the foreign policy world and Stephen before we get to the conversation is currently the senior fellow at the American state craft program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and author of tomorrow the world which was released by Harvard University Press so Stephen thank you very much for being here and for taking the time really appreciate it man my pleasure and so before we get into the interview I wanted to ask you a bit of a biographical question because one of the things that I've noticed that you and I have also talked about a bunch is how so many of the public intellectuals today seem to be historians. Why is there this like big entrance into history graduate programs in 2008 and 2009 of the people who would then come to you know be some of the major critics of the American empire amongst the millennial generation in you know 2015 2016 2017 that to me seems an interesting historical phenomenon well start from the fact that historians were basically written out of the public sphere. I mean it used to be that a major public intellectual like the middle of the 20th century could as well be a historian as anything else. So the Charles Beards of the world are basically done with very few exceptions and I think that's the very few exceptions so in the 1990s I think you have a lot of confidence in elites and a kind of technocratic expertise is valued in the public sphere as well as part of that and so our politics have changed we've come into a moment where no matter who you are basically you were surprised that Donald Trump could be the Republican nominee in 2016 and man was elected president. And then you were probably surprised by a lot of things that happened over the course of the Trump era and so we've come to a point where our space for politics and for imagination is open and I think that creates in a environment where people actually want some orientation. They don't feel oriented and historians are well suited to give that orientation and to say that actually it's not so odd and not so bad that we're having to deal with issues that we thought weren't on the agenda before. And so what would you say that major issue is and I think this brings us to your book so so what is your book about and and really what do you think is the major you know super macro question about American foreign policy that people listening should be asking themselves. Well for me the issue is should the United States continue to pursue global military dominance this is what I grew up with this is just what we did it was basically beyond question you could not be a serious person with a real voice in public life or politics and think that the United States shouldn't have military alliances. And so I think that the United States is across the globe outspend the next many many countries combined on its military hold itself responsible for enforcing so called world order and I wanted to know what I was in grad school not expecting this agenda to have much purchase right in our day to day. So I think sometimes in the future it would become relevant you know I wanted to know well why why do we pursue this world role axiomatically it's the foundation of of our thinking on foreign policy to secure military primacy. So I think that's what I think is the foundation of the United States is what I think is the foundation of the United States is the foundation of the United States. So I think that's the foundation of the United States is the foundation of the United States. So I think that's the foundation of the United States is the foundation of the United States. So I think that's the foundation of the United States is the foundation of the United States. So I think that's the foundation of the United States is the foundation of the United States is the foundation of the United States. So I think that's the foundation of the United States is the foundation of the United States. So I think that's the foundation of the United States is the foundation of the United States is the foundation of the United States. We must meet the threat with our valor, our blood, indeed with our very lives, to ensure that human civilization not insect dominates this galaxy now and always. I think essentially we've been living within those parameters ever since, but it's become more apparent and more troubling over the course of our lifetimes because totalitarian conquerors, the Axis powers and then the Soviet Union and Soviet back communism fell away. I mean, the Soviet Union completely collapsed and yet the United States pursued in some ways a greater military dominance than ever before. And I think that is fundamentally what has produced endless wars, what produced the kind of reaction to 9.11 that we've been talking about. And that is bound to set us up, I fear for more trouble now in a world where you have significant powers like China rising to a degree that wasn't the case back in the 1990s when American foreign policy bakers thought that there would be very few costs and risks to all these actions that they wanted the United States to take. So why did we make that choice? What do you, this is like the big hinge point of history. There was talks of a peace dividend in the early 1990s. There's even talks of, I don't even want to mention it. It's so frightening of NATO being disbanded, you know, of the United States not having access to hundreds of military bases and things along those lines. So this is like the big question, why did we pursue global military dominance, particularly I might add, in an era where you know, you see I would say real stagnation in the American economy, the explosion of credit in the late 1970s, you have deindustrialization, you have offshoring. So what is basically the choice for empire and how do you see that related to the choice for neoliberalism, which Clinton really, you know, puts the pedal to the metal on. So I'm still thinking this through. I mean, the relationship between empire and neoliberalism, I think isn't simple at all because I think it's actually rather hard to see why you need the empire in order for a neoliberal global economy to do its thing. So let me just say I think that's an open question that I'm not done thinking about. I think with respect to the attachment to military dominance, you know, you might look at this on two different levels. On a material level, the United States had built up what Eisenhower called the military industrial complex. That created concentrated interests that had a strong stake in the United States being extremely militarily powerful. Not necessarily in doing specifically X or Y toward this country, but you need some countries to be doing something too in order to keep that thing going. And there were a lot of jobs, including in a deindustrializing context that remained attached to defense production as they do today. So let's start with that condition. And then on and. So that's a demand. I like that's a domestic condition that has nothing to do with US security that has nothing to do with US safety. And I think this is a theme we're going to be returning to in the show, which is the domestic origins of a lot of US foreign policy that I would say, I don't know, Derek, if you agree, that are then smuggled through a security logic effectively where you have the creation. I would say I would say Stephen, I don't know if you agree. I don't think the Soviet Union was ever an existential threat particularly after the mid 1950s. I think the United States was always more dominant, but you have these domestic interests basically being smuggled through a language of security. And I just want to emphasize, because I think that's a really important point, but sorry to interrupt. So you have the, you know, the first of the domestic interests. Right. So already very little incentive for political elites to be serious in dismantling what had been built up, even though the US did actually cut its defense spending across the 1990s as a percentage of GDP. So it kind of looked like there was a little peace dividend even as the US actually proliferated security commitments and began to intervene more frequently since 1991 that it actually did during the Cold War itself. But I digress. So the second thing is on an ideological level for an intellectual level, for people in positions of power, their reading of things was, well, the US was isolationist after 1919, that like 1919 was another pivotal moment for the world. That was a disaster. The US did. What happened to 1919? So World War One ends. What actually happens is that President Wilson proposes this League of Nations with United States to join. The Senate did not join. The League of Nations for lots of reasons. But what didn't happen was that isolationist wanted the US to play no part in world affairs. That's the myth. People didn't even talk really about isolationism at the time. Far less are there like any people who were just saying, United States should do nothing abroad. There was a vibrant interest in American cultural exchange, capitalist exchange, and the US resumed its traditional role with respect to the military, policing the Western hemisphere as well as governing the Philippines as a colony. This is what's so crazy. Whenever people make the isolationist claim, it's like the United States controlled half of the fucking world, and also had a colony in the Philippines. So it's just so bizarre. And this, again, this is something you're going to be returning to again, the Eurocentrism of so much American foreign policy analysis is really insane, where you could just write off the entire continent of Latin America, of South America rather, and Latin Central and South America as being still isolationist. And I think that's an important point that we want to emphasize. So yes, so that happens. So then people again have this, they have this bugaboo, this fear of isolationism that is constantly referred to in the 1990s, I imagine, that people are constantly worried about that. Right, and it's rooted that fear, as I show in the book, is rooted in the 30s and 40s when the people who actually come to favor US global military dominance, call their opponents isolationists. And so if anyone's an isolationist, it would be surely the America firsters in 1941, who didn't want the United States to join World War II. Those are the quintessential people. They wanted the United States to defend the entire Western hemisphere. So ask central Americans whether that sounds like isolationism to them. So this conceptualization is formed and what American policymakers tell themselves, and many Americans tell themselves, in 1945 is that the country has cast off its isolationism, learned its lesson and embraced internationalism, right, now equated with global military dominance. And so in 1991 or in the years when the Soviet Union was coming apart, what policymakers said was, well, okay, basically, we don't want the 1919 route, that's isolationism. We want the 1945. And so let's complete the project that we set out to achieve before the Cold War happened as of 1945, where we have one world united under American supervision. And so I think that basic conceptualization of the world in America's place in it helps to explain why the United States didn't reap the peace dividend after 1991. And it helps, remember, when you have to explain, isn't just that action, it's why there was almost no thought given to taking that course of action too. That course of action would have been beyond the pale. I think, well, first of all, I'm surprised you didn't say job security was the reason why everybody was becoming historians, because obviously, there's a lot of that. But secondly, it might be helpful to remind the people that our third president, Thomas Jefferson, went to war with North Africa at the start of the 19th century. Before the war of 1812, which I realized this cast is this sort of defensive America, even though it involved an invasion of Canada. But we were at war with the Barbary States, which all the way over there, but it's still cast as the sort of, the United States was isolationist. Yeah, and I think you were right. It's a Eurocentric way of looking at the world. When you talk about military entanglements, that phrase, as it gets used for the first 150 years or so of American history, is it means stay out of Europe. It doesn't mean don't get involved in Latin America. It doesn't mean don't go to war with the Barbary States. It means stay out of European affairs, basically. And that even becomes an American culture, like the Marine Corps song from the halls of Montezuma to the shores of Chor, it's right there. Yeah, it's right there. Right there. From the halls of Montezuma to the shores of Chor. But this is what just annoys me so much about like the Iconberry Doidney piece, apologies I'm getting the pronunciation of that name, and correct. But it's just like so focused on where the empire was good. I have to say if you're in France, if you're in the UK, if you're in the FRG West Germany, it's a pretty good thing to be under, you know, in the US imperial sphere. And I think, you know, if you're looking back on this history in 1500 years, you might even effectively say from Germany to the West, it's like there's a North Atlantic polity that is developing over time, and you can view the world wars as a type of civil war, in some sense, but that's for another time. But it totally writes out the other things that are happening, and particularly in the Philippines where the United States fought a brutal counter-insurgency campaign that was defined by horrible racism, you know, the water cure, i.e. waterboarding, and things that would become foundational to the American experience. But Steven, Jacques Hughes, how dare you? Don't you know that Trump has destroyed the liberal international order and that everything that we have done for the world has been taken apart? So what do you think? How do you think Trump fits into this larger story that you're telling? Because when he was elected, this was the big fear, right? The United, the abandonment of the liberal international order, foreign affairs, foreign policy, all of these places were publishing these pieces about how Trump was his big shift. So what do you think, I want to ask first, what do you think that reaction, which I know to both of all three of us seemed overblown at the time, what do you think that was a reflection of? Fear. So I still don't know what the liberal international order is. In fact, that phrase came in to the White House. It's the rules based international order now. So Steven, it's even more obscure. Rules based, U.S. led, rules based liberal international order. Just keep on adding adjectives, it distracts the world. Post-war, rules based, liberal international order. That's all the adjectives. Yeah, that's all the material. So you can pick and choose from those. Very few people were actually talking about that thing before Trump, right? So this tradition is brought into being, at least in those terms, right? Suddenly in reaction to Trump. My reading of it is that, well, first in the campaign, a lot of people wanted to exclude Trump, just knock them out by saying he's an isolationist. And then when he used the phrase America first, and he made noises about words in the Middle East, any questioned alliances, it all seemed to be falling into place. Can't question alliances. That's number one rule. The question and alliances to be beyond the pale, it is the most annoying, to even question it. Is, and then we could talk about tornado piece, but it's so ridiculous, sorry Steven. They're sacred, no, I mean, I just need to be brand-nado. And if you just call it by O-Tam, like that will get people off there. Attachment to your native. They love it, they love it folks. So, first there was this attempt to just say, look, Trump is beyond the pale, but it didn't work. If anything, it seemed to confirm to certain voters that Trump was indeed as different from the status quo as he claimed to be, which he wasn't. And then it became a line of attack used to basically equate US-led multilateralism with US military primacy, as if those two things go together naturally. Could you expand on that a bit? What's US-led multilateralism? What are you referring to there? So, you know, when Trump does things like pull out of the WHO, one of his earlier ones was to pull out of UNESCO, et cetera. Which the US has done before I might add, the US has pulled out of UNESCO before. I think the same reason. The same reason, by the way. Correct. Many of the things Trump did in foreign policy have precedents that are not even far in the past. Even his rhetoric about alliances, like Obama was saying similar things much more politely to ask Europeans to spend more on their defense. So was his secretary of defense, Robert Gates. And then it was how dare Trump, you know, say these things in a nasty way, and then wind up in exactly the same place on policy, right? The NATO alliance continues and expands under his watch. Alliance's US alliance has expanded under the Trump administration, and not a single war was ended. Let's just be clear about that fact. But the argument was made specifically. He's out to destroy this US-led rules-based post-war liberal international order. And therefore is the antithesis of everything America has been trying to do since, well, the date kind of varied, but 1945 or 1948 or whatever you said this order came into being. And, you know, I see this as another attempt to try to rehabilitate US military dominance and make it seem like it's one of the same essential to other forms of international cooperation. And that's what the concept of isolationism, that's what its usage does, because against isolationism, you can seem to want to dominate the world and cooperate with everyone else at the same time. So a question that I have, and I guess this is for both of you guys, is what is sort of the, the, I'm trying to think of the right word, like there's almost, it's like a Dowager Countess is offended when you, it's like, how dare you? Is it really true? There's sort of, there's a cultural element to people's responses when you make this argue in about US foreign policy, which is almost very fragile and very unbelieving. And I was wondering as you two much more than me have been in the sort of the blob world, is what is the relationship between these people's identities and US foreign policy that they get so offended? How dare you? You know, how dare you suggest that France pay for its security? It's such a strange cultural element to me. I was wondering what you guys thought about that, either of you. Well, they didn't, I mean, they didn't complain about asking France to pay for its security when, the Obama administration asked. You know, it's really about, I think, this investment in America's image, American prestige, as the leader of this rules-based international, whatever international order. And Trump, you know, was too much of a buffoon to kind of play the role, the image of an American president as the kind of, you know, grandee of this system. And, you know, he was just a lot pruder about it. And that's, I think, embarrassing on some level to people in the foreign policy establishment, because these aren't necessarily things that they don't believe themselves. A lot of the things that Trump would talk about, these aren't things that, you know, these are things, you know, you talk about sort of in over a glass of whiskey or something at the bar, but they're not things that you're supposed to say in public, out loud. And it just, you know, it's sort of like, you know, get that back behind the curtain here. Yeah, I think that's right. And I think there's a lot of the American foreign policy debate is really about America's image, debate is really about American identity. America's leadership role in the world is part of how the country understands what it is. So, when, you know, Hillary Clinton could talk about America's already great in the 2016 campaign. That goes together with the idea that we stand tall in the world where the indispensable version. Yes. This is the Madeline Albright quote. It's really wacky. She, she, she basically says in a 1998 interview with I believe Matt Lauer that America stands taller and sees farther. So if people die, it was worth it. Essentially something along those lines. It goes back to Reagan's shining city on the Hill rhetoric. I mean, it's the same. It's just different versions of the same thing. America is the, you know, example, part excellence of what humanity should try to be. And we have to uphold that image at all times. And Trump was, you know, doesn't clearly, I mean, to the extent that the United States actually upholds that image, which I would question, you know, Donald Trump is clearly not it. Yeah. He, he openly disavowed American exceptionalism. Not a whole lot of people noticed actually on the campaign trail, but he said he didn't like the term. And he consistently presented the United States as in a competitive environment in the world where the United States had no special moral claim to stand over the world. Now he continued to want the United States to dominate others. So I don't think his rejection of exceptionalism led to a better place at all. But nevertheless, he did not go for this traditional view of the indispensable nation. And I think that drove people wild. And that's the big quote related to that. I'm going to mangle a little bit, but, you know, the we're killers too. Putin's a killer. A lot of killers. We've got a lot of killers. Why do you think our country's so innocent? The liberal media establishment, they went apoplectic over that. Because basically, I think the Trump administration in general is just he literally, in every element of his policy, made subtext text in his speeches and in his literal, you know, justifications for policy. It's just what the actual effects of these things were just used to justify them in a way that no one had ever done before. But, you know, thank God Biden was elected. We could all breathe a sigh of relief. We could return to brunch as the famous saying goes. So why don't we actually turn to our reading series and I'll turn it over to my co-host, Derek Davidson, to expound upon this wonderful essay that appeared in a foreign policy magazine last week. Is this just to give some, yeah, no, it's a classic. And just to give some brief context, this essay was written by Daniel Dudney and Adoydny and John Ikembary, who are basically, and Steven, you correct me from wrong sort of the dons of what might be termed a liberal approach to international relations. That essentially argues that, you know, multilateral capitalism, multilateral exchange through essentially Western dominated, North and really North Atlantic dominated, international institutions are the key to pieces. Is there anything to add to that? Ikembary is at Princeton and Dudney's somewhere also really good, I forget where I'll look it up. But Steven, is that an accurate portrayal of what they're, and he's at Hopkins, Dudney. Is that an accurate portrayal? Yeah, Ikembary also wrote a book that came out recently and you can see that he's tried to fit the history and the Biden administration into the framework of that book as a lot of scholars do, but that's part of the problem with this piece. So, okay, this piece is the intellectual foundations of the Biden revolution. That's short, I mean, it's been six months, but he hasn't really done anything revolutionary, but let's go with that. 1917, 1945, 2021. I don't necessarily want you guys to comment on this first paragraph, but I do wanna read it because I think for people who haven't seen the article, it will draw a picture. The unexpected four years of the Donald Trump presidency took US foreign and domestic policies and troubling directions. Frontedly rejecting all the pillars of what he took to be the bipartisan establishments foreign policy. Trump set the United States on a boldly different path. He rejected longstanding alliance commitments calling into question NATO and the security packs with Japan and South Korea. He attacked international institutions and withdrew the United States from numerous arms control and free trade agreements, even going so far as pulling out of the World Health Organization in the middle of a pandemic. He embraced climate denialism and withdrew from the Paris Climate Accord. He was hostile to the promotion of democracy and human rights. He aggressively alienated allies while cozying up to a rogue's gallery of despots, autocrats and populists. God, imagine. And I just wanna, I just wanna underline just very quickly this sort of democracy promotion stuff. Like obviously we all know it's bullshit with regards to a rock, but in terms of history, this political scientist, Lindsay Orrark, and her book has revealed that the US tried to covertly overthrow regimes 66 times. And I believe in 44 of those cases explicitly supported authoritarian or anti-democratic forces. So that's a type of democracy promotion that we're referring to here. So this is, I mean, this paragraph kind of makes it clear what we're talking about is Donald Trump is a fundamentally different kind of president who broke American foreign policy. Although, here we are six months into the Biden administration. Seems like we've pretty much either continued deliberately or fixed all the things that Trump did or kind of reversed them. But they go on to sort of lament the fact that there's no Rooseveltian school of foreign policy. You know, there's schools for named after Alexander Hanover, Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson. Even John Quincy Adams. Even John Quincy Adams. Even John Quincy Adams. And then there's a bunch of isms, of course. You have neo conservatism, realism, isolationism, liberal internationalism, et cetera. So which seems indistinguishable from what these guys are talking about, but okay. But there's no Rooseveltianism and this is bad. And I guess so my first question to the two of you is what is Rooseveltianism? And I think we should start with what they kind of lay out here. You know, we go into the piece and they write at one point that Roosevelt as a colossus in US history is a truism. Over the course of his unprecedented 12 years in office, he accomplished a revolutionary recasting of the United States domestic order and place in the world. And then you know, sort of goes through his record and internationally, the United States went from being a regional power to a global military superpower, leader of a multi continental wartime alliance. More than anyone else Roosevelt laid the foundations for Pax Americana and inaugurated what became known as the American Century. Here's the key part. The Rooseveltian revolution was decisive in a development of modern liberalism, but it built on its and internationalism, but it built on its predecessors, such as Theodore Roosevelt's new nationalism and Wilson's new freedom and was in turn built upon by successors, including Harry S. Truman's Fair deal, John F. Kennedy's new frontier and Lyndon B. Johnson's great society. It was this political project to which Biden has returned that brought the United States to its peak of greatness. So as I'm trying to figure out what FDR Rooseveltianism is, this is the first statement of it. And it sounded the first thing I thought of was, you know, when they asked the now dearly departed Donald Rumsfeld where the WMD were and he said, well, they're in the area around to Crete and Baghdad and also to the east, west, north, and south. Like we're all over the map here. Like what is Rooseveltianism? Well, it's all these things that came before and then all these things that came after, but it's somehow distinct. What do you guys make of this? Well, Steven, this is your specialty. So is that an accurate description of US history, my friend? Oh my God. So first of all, so FDR was president for a long time and underwent a lot of change. So they want to lump together, you know, FDR saved the capitalism or the country with the new deal and then FDR set the foundations for American military primacy. Oh, that's true except that FDR changed his mind fundamentally in the 1930s when he was focused on the new deal. He was focused on the new deal and even proclaimed a good neighbor policy toward Latin America, which is quite a significant thing for us to reflect on in which the United States renounced interventionism even in its own sphere of influence in a way that it didn't do before and really hasn't said. And I just want to add just an interesting historical footnote. That's where a lot of Latin American culture, I think came to the US where I wasn't Carmen Moran, from around that time and the Disney characters that were, I believe, of Latin American origin. So this is, yeah, this is like this big shift in Latin American US cultural exchange and a lot of these things that entered essentially what became hegemonic white culture were during this sort of 30s period. So it was a, I would say a high point of cultural exchange in the 20th century. Yeah, it was a high point of American identification as American as part of the Americas. And that seemed like it would continue for the 30s and even into 1940, given how much the country did not want to be part of the looming war in Europe and Asia. And FDR was part of that until FDR changed his mind as did many others, but FDR made an explicit turn from being Mr. New Deal to being Mr. Wind the War and then pursued US military primacy. So just as a, and I'm not saying anything that's controversial. I mean, like, it's basic. You know, in controversial and that's part, that's the point. This is, yeah, this is not, you know, this is just like any historian will tell you this. So it's all lumped together as one teleological Roosevelt in their account. And then it turns out that Roosevelt doesn't even matter because Roosevelt was only building on Teddy Roosevelt who was only, and then there was Woodrow Wilson and then FDR and then all the others until something happens, and this is I think the interesting part of the article that is not part of the article, which is that they say that the tradition was breached after the 1970s by Reagan and Reagan's successors. And there is no account of what that was. What was that breach? Somehow they were isolationist, I guess, because it culminates in Trump. And yet that's an incoherent account of Trump. The key line and the whole thing is when they write, and I'm quoting them, building on Trump and Obama administration policies, Biden has further elevated the challenge of China to the top of the policy agenda. So Trump is an isolationist totally out of step with anything good and decent at American, except that Trump, Lady Foundation that Biden is building on with respect to China, which is like the number one issue today. It's totally incoherent, and I think it offends my sensibilities in two ways. One, there's so much of this, basically, there's a lack of a better phrase, historical bullshit that is constantly just reframe. Like totally anti-historical historian, this is like Stephen said, this is a basic point that is just totally used for ideological purposes, which you know, fine, we all do that. But it's just so against what every historian thinks, I would add, regardless of political persuasion. This is, again, these are not controversial points, but it's just totally anti-historical. So that's offensive. And then it's also, and I don't actually mean offensive, obviously, but then it's also anti-imperial, because as Stephen gestured toward earlier, the Military Interventions Project, which I believe is out of tuffs, has essentially demonstrated that 25% of interventions in the US history since 1776 have occurred since the end of the Cold War. So I don't understand how anyone could reasonably put that in one, in any way, sensor or form as isolationist, and then two distinguished Trump from these larger traditions. It's just absolutely incoherent. And then why is foreign policy publishing this? I mean, these are basic things that editors should be aware of. And it just shows a type of group think that allows one to thrive in this sort of establishment, I think. I wouldn't get back into the piece a little bit, but I think we'll culminate with China, because I think that's what the real parallel between Biden and Roosevelt is, but I'll get to that in a minute. I just want to throw out some phrases. It's a very long piece. So if people want to read it, we're not going to go through the entire thing here. Godspeed. But yeah, really good luck. Good luck with that. But I want to throw out some, some, a couple of phrases here from various parts of the piece. The Rooseveltian tradition is more relevant than ever, because many of the central problems in world politics ranging from nuclear proliferation and climate change to transnational migration and pandemic management are problems of interdependence that spill across borders, okay, fair enough. To address these problems, both domestically and internationally, the liberal internationalists argue the cooperation and institutions are required, which invariably restrains the freedom of everyone to some degree. I'm playing out in the context of where this piece is being written as the Biden revolution. Like the Biden administration has been slammed rightly so for several months now for practicing vaccine nationalism, and deliberately kind of not addressing the international ramifications of pandemic management. But we talk about the pursuit of public interest and the successful functioning of modern industrial societies and the need for interdependence and somehow liberal internationalism is the way to do this. Later, they write about the need, well, left to their own devices, capital societies stratify, and modern liberal democrats view extreme inequality as a problem. I don't know where this is coming from, but Roosevelt talked about economic royalism and supposedly, I guess we were doing something about extreme inequality at a global level. There's a paragraph on the wake of World War II modern liberals designed and implemented the international monetary fund, the World Bank and the general agreement on tariffs and trade, the last of which ultimately became the World Trade Organization. These international institutions provided a framework for reopening the world economy, paving the way for a golden era of sustained global economic growth in the spread of capitalism. And it's attended prosperity to previously very poor societies all over the world. So I think you guys were saying, yeah. Like as you guys were saying, there's a certain just, you know, A historical nature and all of this. I thought maybe you could comment on that. It's a fantasy, it's a fantasia. And even as someone who's like lived there the last few years in the blob, what do you think that fantasia is and just everything that Tarek said? You know, I think this piece is even beyond, look, a lot of people in the important policy making, at least understand dynamics of power. This piece is totally mystifying on that score. You know, if what they want is to manage the problems of interdependence and coordinate things, then why did they just say, oh, it's great that Biden has built on Trump's legacy to elevate the challenge of China to the top. I mean, why does focus on, they just kind of take it all as a given. It's not important. It's there. It's all part of the project and see it's all has a nice pedigree from a comforting past. So I find this to be actually like, it's not the US, it's not coming from the US foreign policy communities. Specifically, it's coming from some professors who are not engaged in recognizable questions of power. And I actually find that to be almost the scariest of all options. So what do you think that indicates as someone who's been both in and outside the academy? Because I think that's really interesting because I think it's an important question because so much of our public discourse on foreign policy is really driven by academics, is really driven by professors. So what do you think that says about the academy? Why did you leave the academy, Steven? Why did you abandon us? So I don't know about this, the particular case of these two authors. I do think that the academy has become introverted in part because it's just a cutthroat environment to be part of it, to climb your way up, to getting tenure and so forth. There's very little incentive to engage the wider world including even the policy world, which I think a lot of people actually want to do if they could figure out how to do that. And then of course, you have to say, it's not as though the policy world is like super eager to hear from academics who are pontificating in the way that we've pointed to from this article. And you know, you can spot very quickly, okay, this is an academic who's in their own head that is saying things of no relevance to the actual choices that we face. So it is a two-way street, but I think it's lamentable that these two realms have grown so far apart and I do not know the way to bridge that gap except to try to create spaces that literally do that kind of thing and can bring the two realms together. There are a couple more, just a couple more things I wanted to sort of throw at you guys to make you pull more of your hair out. But along the lines of this historical Fantasia about the greatness of Roosevelt, Rooseveltian America, there are in a couple of places kind of very obvious mischaracterizations, I guess, or straw men of the kinds of arguments, I guess these guys are anticipating they might get an opposition to their peace. For one, in one case, they write, the America that brought unprecedented peace, prosperity and security to the international system was the America brought into existence by Roosevelt's new deal. Had the laissez-faire and isolationist opposition to the new deal, the United Nations, NATO and other domestic and international projects been successful, the United States might well not have sought or been able to play its pivotal role in the great struggles of the 20th century. So I think there we have the kind of false, the sort of throwing around of isolationism in a way that sloppy and, you know, presents a kind of false choice between, you know, it was either this maximal international presence or just retreating behind the oceans and doing nothing which I think is fundamentally presented as a bad faith kind of way. Later they write that overall liberal democracies and their movements have over two centuries of often difficult struggle, expanded freedom, human rights and mass prosperity in ways that are cumulatively revolutionary. During the 20th century, the United States played pivotal roles in thwarting and subverting empires, including the global empire building of Germany, Japan, Italy and the Soviet Union. This is so insane. Left leading critics who characterize the US system as yet another empire failed to recognize that it is won by invitation and that the number of independent countries in the world rolls explosively during the period of greatest US influence. Leftist critics and historians, and I'm pointing at the finger at you too now, I've shown that the glass of freedom has never been full, but they fail to acknowledge that it has become steadily fuller that the United States has played a key, and that the United States has played a key role in filling it. And by the way, there's a new mention of Iraq or Afghanistan in this piece. Or Iran or Guatemala or the Congo or Chile or Lebanon or what have you. I mean, that was all my invitation. Yeah, you're welcome. Yeah, thank you. You're welcome world for inviting us in. So Steven, what's your take on that? Is that good stuff? Would you teach that to your undergrad? No, look, I think that finally makes sense of who this piece is aimed at, because otherwise it's so unclear. And I also noticed that they pepper the word restraint about in the piece. I think that's an attempt to try to say that our approach is the real way to get restraint as opposed to those who are calling for US military restraint. And they ought to be forced to actually cite somebody. I mean, I like that they called out like left leaning whatever and included historians in that. That's awesome, but it seems like they ought to have to actually name some people, provide some evidence, and that goes for the entire essay. And I just say like, I am very liberal minded when it comes to what I think should be out in the public sphere. But if I were to write some correspondingly loose piece, I wouldn't get published from my perspective. Like what would it, you know, would not get published anywhere. What would it have to be? It'd be like Charles Limberg is a hero and then he wasn't listen to. I mean, something just be so insane. Yeah, it would have to be like the caricature of isolationism. And then it wouldn't get published. So I think this also indicates sort of the the the scurs of world of the foreign policy establishment that as you as but it generously a loose piece like this, what is it? 6,000, 7,000 words easy, right? It published in one of the major foreign policy journals in the country. And I think that indicates indicates something. We get I think in the last couple of paragraphs to the real message here. And it's it's illustrative. You know, Steven, one of the things you mentioned, you know, as we were like talking about this piece before the interview, was the application of FDR's vision of American kind of or liberal internationalism, which rested on American military primacy to a time when you know, trying to trying to sort of impose that or superimpose that on the Biden administration at a time when the challenges that we face don't really have military solutions, their pandemics and climate change and things that that you know, can't be bombed into submission. But we get to the last couple of paragraphs. And I think it becomes clear the ways in which these guys want Biden or the way in which they want Biden to mirror Roosevelt. They write the problems that the Biden administration has elevated to grand strategic importance are a mixture of familiar and novel building on efforts begun by the previous two administrations here again, sort of the incoherence of this. It has made the problem of the rise of China's central focus in responding to the Chinese challenge Biden's liberal emphasis on rebuilding alliances, championing democracy and human rights and promoting a national industrial policy is clearly superior to the realist libertarian Trumpian emphasis on pulling back internationally and dismantling the modern US state. The Biden strategy rests on the assumption that China with its strong central government booming capitalist economy modernized autocratic model and revisionist foreign policy poses a full spectrum threat that will require a full spectrum response. In the same way, the aspiration of many to reduce US power and impact is out of date and out of place at a moment when the global balance of power between liberal democracy and autocracy is unfavorably shifting. In the face of the novel and powerful Chinese autocratic challenge, the task for the United States as Biden has succinctly captured is to show the world that democracy works in solving problems. So I think effectively we want Joe to give us our cold war back. That's the familiar structure, the one that makes it easier to talk about how wonderful America is. And it's sort of comforting, I think, in a way to a part of the foreign policy establishment. At the same time, we are in a time when, again, the challenges that we really face, not only does a cold war with China raise additional risks of World War III of some kind of a nuclear change, but it manifestly stands in the way of addressing climate change or any kind of any issue that requires a global approach pandemics, any of these things. It manifestly kind of prevents that. I wonder where you guys kind of land here is we kind of get to the point, I think, which is we want a cold war with China. I wish they had argued that. I mean, that is what they're saying, but they provide no actual reasons for it. And I think that's what's maddening. And I also don't think it's going to work anymore. I mean, maybe there was a time in the past couple decades where you could just put an ideological gloss on what the United States was doing and people would go, okay, fine, that sounds good. I'm reassured. And actually what they're doing with Roosevelt's very similar to what a lot of people did with Woodrow Wilson a couple decades ago, you know, Woodrow Wilson was the template for the Bush administration. Now it's just shifted up in time to FDR who by the way was also carrying on the legacy of Woodrow Wilson. So what's the difference? But, you know, let's go ahead and have that argument about what to do about China, right? It's a multifaceted issue. It's not so simple of all the challenges there are. It's one of the more the more weighty ones, but they just kind of plopped down a position and say time to go back to the Cold War, time to lead the free world and say that China poses a full spectrum kind of threat. So we don't have to differentiate between the economic challenges that it poses the human rights issues and the military issues. So again, give us some analysis of power, please. But I think if they think that they can just do the ideological magic wand shaking that seems to have worked for a couple decades now, if they think that's going to work in the future, I think they're wrong. And I think just to build on that is that it really displays an intellectual exhaustion with this entire way of looking at the world, which is I think what the Roosevelt gambit that they're doing is trying to essentially replace is that they really don't have a program for what is going on. So they just want to return to the Cold War. And I imagine that this is something we'll be seeing in the coming years. But Steven, thank you so much for taking the time. Derek and I will speak for Derek. Derek and I really appreciate your being on the podcast, particularly our inaugural episode. And just to remind everyone, check out tomorrow, the world, Steven's new book, which really provides a new understanding of the US rise to armed primacy in the Germany. So Steven, thank you. And the American Statecraft Program at the Carnegie Endowment check those. Keep an eye on that. Thank you, Buck. This was a pleasure. I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you.

So I hope you're being a lazy money-grubbing socialist while we're working hard to give you a podcast on today, the Socialist Holiday. But I'd like to start today's episode by giving the flowers to, as the kids say, Matt and Chris congratulating them on their wonderful run of Hell on Earth. I would say the best history podcast of all time. But seriously, I'm sorry. You guys knocked it out of the park. Amazing work on Hell on Earth. I really enjoyed the whole series. And Charles Austin's We Didn't Start the Fire 17th Century Edition, which was fantastic. Yes, thank you to Catherine for having that idea because it ended up being pretty good. It was a great way to put a cap on a, otherwise also a great series. So thanks everybody for listening. Matt and Chris will return for more history podcasting in the future. Absolutely. Right. Well, we got to, let's start this week talking about an upcoming historical event that's sure to be remembered in the animals of recorded history. The whole world has coronation fever. That's right. On May 6th, Prince Charles becomes King Charles. And I don't know about you guys, but I've been obsessed with all of the details about the bizarre crown jewels that are all part of this wacky little pageant that all, like Felix, they all sound like covenant technology. Like they all sound like something the arbiter has to like unearth the ring world. Yeah. Yeah. And like seven swords, they're all, they're all being assigned to people who, you know, are lords or dukes or, or ladies, the sort of temporal justice, which definitely sounds like something the arbiter uses. A time sword. It cuts through time. Well, we know where they got that idea. Yeah. Yeah. Luke Jefferbeng ripped off. So yeah, actually, I found in the telegraph, I have a full list of all of the King Charles III's coronation regalia. And it says here, at the heart of the King's coronation will be ancient and invaluable, jewel-encrusted regalia from swords to crowns, much of which has been used for more than a thousand years. And I just like to go through them with you guys right now. And I would like us to, right, there are, there are, are four different sort of categories of regalia, each with their own powers and ceremony associated with them. But I'd like us to go through all this regalia. And I just want to like choose one from each category to be your load out for like your starting character, you know, you're going to start this campaign, you know, like what will kind of build? Are you guys running on this King Charles III coronation? Starting with the procession, which includes the mace. You guys remember the mace, of course. Yeah, classic, great, great mall style weapon. Yeah, it's a blunt, it does blunt damage. Then we got, then we got the sword of spiritual justice. I think that, you know, if you're running a faith build, you'd be, you'd be hard pressed to find a better weapon. Yeah, that's a good one for clerics. Yeah. The St. Edward staff, you know, that sort of, you know, intelligent magic base build, the sort of mercy, the sort of temporal justice and the sort of state, you know, I think sort of mercy, more of a, more of a Dex build, sort of temporal justice, maybe a Dex strength hybrid and then sort of state, probably just pretty much straight up strength. Then for the anointing, there are two very important items. There's the ampula, which is like a golden, looks like a golden goose of some kind. It literally looks like a golden bird of a duck of some kind. Then the coronation spoon, which looks like a butt plug. I don't know what either of those are used for. So it's like sword, sword, sword, sword, sword spoon. Well, now, okay, okay, like that. And the person, these are the, these are the, like, your right handed weapon are going to be the mace to the sort of state. And then the, in the anointing ceremony, there's the ampula and coronation spoon, which are like, I don't know, like provide buffs for your character or some kind. Well, usually an item, an item like a spoon that you can't equip is a weapon. Usually, that's like, it's part of a quest or you use it to, you, you have to use it to get into some other part of the map. So we might see that later on. I know that King Charles, the study has a 10 year plan. He's going to be king for 10 years and then step down and then it's, it's William time. You know, it's William and Kate's time. So presumably he, I don't know, maybe he'll use that to kill himself. I don't know. Then, then there is the investiture part of the ceremony, which comes after the anointing. And some of the items that you will encounter in the investiture part of the map include spurs, another sword, this time it's the jeweled sword of offering. Then you've got our mills, which look like sort of gold, the sort of cuffs or bracelets of some kind, then just the classic orb, you know, you can have any kind of orb without an orb. Then you've got the sovereign's ring and the sovereign's scepter with cross and scepter with dove. Now that's one item that may sound like two items, but you get with the sovereign scepter, you get both the cross and a scepter with a dove. So I think they're going to have to nerf that one in the next patch. Let's just a little overpower it. Did they all make this from Elizabeth's soul? They transposed it. Yes. Yeah. Because I didn't hear about any of this stuff before. You know, presumably they made it from her. And then finally, the crowning part of the ceremony, there will be the St. Edward's crown, the queen consort's ring, the queen Mary's crown, the imperial state crown, and the queen's consort's scepter with cross and rod with dove. Again, that's one item. I don't know what's going on here. It's so funny. It's so funny how, you know, they do all this. And then the only other time we see them use the sword is when they give like, they're alton, john, you're a knight now. Yeah. Yeah. That's all you could do with the sword as a monarch at this point is, is dub, dub of people shit. That's it. All right. So I guess for me, like, you know, my build here, I think, I think I'm, I think I'm going with the, uh, the sort of mercy. I'm going to buff that, I'm going to buff that, the coronation. Well, it's, it's, it's called the sort of mercy, Matt, but it's meant to be ironic. I mean, this is, this, this was used by the execution lord. I see. It's like, you know, the king's mercy is a swift death, not, not a long painful one. Right. Exactly. Yeah. I'm not going to burn it at the stake or something. Uh-huh. So yeah, I'm going to buff that with the coronation spoon. Um, and then I'm going to, obviously got to take the orb. You know, that gives you plus five stats across the board. And, uh, then I'm going with the imperial state crown just for fashion, just to stutter on hose. Yeah. What, what I'm doing is, you know, I look at all the, these are all legendary weapons. They seem nice, but what I'm actually doing is I'm going, I'm going to a, um, it's a, um, hidden wall. I hack it a hidden wall in fucking Ham Palace because it's, it's, um, it's in a hallway. And there's one part of the hallway that doesn't have a painting on it. And that's the hidden wall. And I, I press R1. I go through that and it leads me to a very special thing, a very special hidden part of the map, disraeli's tomb. And why do I want to go to disraeli's tomb? Because I go there, I go there and I do the gesture, Judeaic wave. And it's, it sends me to fight Benjamin, Disraeli in the past. And this is one of the harder fights that you can have. You can see why a lot of people haven't done it. But after I do, after I'm able to sort of deep to us, Benjamin, Disraeli and, uh, avoid a lot of his lighting attacks, I'm able to get Benjamin, Disraeli's soul. And I can, I can transfuse that into disraeli staff, which is the most powerful magic catalyst in the entire thing. That's excellent. Yeah. If you're a caster like me, yeah, that's what you want. No, but like what I like about the coronation is that you can run like a caster build, a strength build, a cleric build. It's very versatile. That's what there's all these different swords. I mean, the question is, what kind of build will King Charles III be running for Great Britain? Yeah. You know, will he, will he, um, surprise everyone? Will he have a secret item like Anthony Eden's lipstick? I mean, so if I'm doing this, do I have, am I for King Charles or am I me? Because if I'm King Charles, I need something in my rucksack, my bag of holding that will do something about my fingers because if I don't do something about those horrifying blood plantains that he has on the end of his hands, I don't think I'm going to be able to wield the sword or certainly not wear a ring unless it's the size of a fucking, like, Holston's onion ring because if you've seen, uh, and he doesn't show them anymore in, in public images, uh, King Charles's fingers are terrifying. But Matt, you know what I mean, Matt, you haven't played the coronation game long enough. Uh, King Charles is disgusting, curled fingers or how you summon other players to, to join you in a boss arena. Well, I, uh, I definitely want the sort of temporal justice. That's the coolest one. You can do time shift. You can be a time cop or a time lord. I don't know how you can say no to something like that. Uh, give me the ampule, the, the goose shaped ampule. I bet there's something fun that comes out of there. If you rub it or something, uh, and then I'll take, uh, yeah, I'll take, I'll take the ring because as I said, it must be gigantic sovereigns ring. Yeah. The sovereigns ring. Give me that. Yeah. I guess that would be, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know builds. I don't know what you're talking about. You tell me what that build is. You're in the, I, I, I, I think you're running a, like a strength build, Matt, um, but, you know, like these are all very good items. I want to say they're rare items. And, you know, some of them are a thousand years old. I also saw like they were like the stone of destiny has, uh, has reached the capital. And it was just like, can you knock it off with this shit? This is embarrassing for everybody. You can, you can tell that none of these are actually imported because the IRA never tried to like blow any of these up or take them. This is how you know they're running a fucking game on us because it's like at no point, like the IRA's, you know, they put bombs all over fucking London at no point where they ever like, oh, yeah, we're going to, we're going to put a bomb in the London stock exchange and we're going to take, we're, yeah, we're going to take the galaxy sword or whatever the fuck you have. I did read about this, no, the destiny that Scottish nationalist took it in the 1950s or something. They stole it. The Scottish nationals are the biggest fucking bullshitters they are. Yeah. That's like, they, they're not really serious about this bullshit that they're instead of kidnapping the goddamn prince. The kidnapping is, we got your, we got your rock. Well, all British monarchs have been, have been, have been anointed on the stone of destiny. Is that all of them? Well, I don't know. I mean, for a while now, for a while now, you know, because the thing is, most of these August rituals that people now paint toast, so painstakingly create that they claim that they're coming from this ancient lineage, but almost all of our traditions were invented in the 19th century. All the stuff that we take is like, eternal features of our ritualized politics. We're all made up by Victorian imperial perverts and that, and all to keep their power and, like culturally validated. And that's the point of it. It's not that old. I bet most of that shit's from fucking pound land. Is that the name they got over there? Yeah. It's not dollar general. It's pound land. Pound town. Yes. We yeah, yeah. I mean, like, yeah, most, most things we assign is being super old are like at most, like 300 years old. I'm like, all the stuff with America, America is like a fake old country. It's why we have a Senate, you know, the fucking all the weaves, all the weaves who founded this country. We're like, ooh, let's have Roman columns. Yeah. The fucking the the the winters are fake English dynasty. They're fucking crowds. Yeah, they're literally a bunch of Germans, a bunch of German tourists who like want to sweepstakes. They had literally they they couldn't the the the the stewards couldn't stop popping out Catholics. And then they bring in that they literally had to like start looking for German cousins to find then the most closely related protest that they pluck some rub off of a Dung Hill and anover and said, Hey, you want to be king of England? He's like, ah, that's that's make good that will go for it. I mean, yeah, there's really like nothing that's actually thousands of years old outside of China because there is a continuance from the government from the government shown the movie hero to Xi Jinping. Yeah, that's the only one. That's the only one. But everything else is like 200, 300 years old. Pocetic Jews. They're like these are ancient traditions. They stretch back a hundred and four years. It's true. Like, yeah, the outfits they wear are literally suits and ties. Like what the fuck? Yeah, that was no, that was not in Judea or Samaria. No, there were no Fedoras. Nobody was wearing a Fedora when they stoned Christ. Yeah, they do that. I don't think that never mind. They were going to stoned very naturally. And Jesus stopped them from doing it. All right. Yeah. Yeah. In my head canna, they just ignored him and just kept fucking pelting him. But yeah, no, there is, there is nothing that old. Everyone is a Mormon to some extent, you know? Yep. You got it's all it. Hall had to be reforged for the modern era because this stuff all refers to things that are extinct like modes of being and thought and imagination. Like we all, we, we de-sacrifice the world and return it into, yeah, a market where value is apportioned through prices. And but we still have these, these, uh, these modes of thought and they have to be reforged and filled with new bullshit. Well, how is him? That's another one. That's exactly. Yes, it's actually centuries. You're China and Japan actually eternal. Yeah, that's true. That's why they're going to take it over. Yeah. That's why they're going to eat and leave no crumbs. China, Japan, they're already, they're already having a positive birth rate again. Oh, yeah. It's true. I'm a day after they swim, killed their friend. I met us. Yeah. And that's true. He was, and that was his big thing. He was, he was also fast fixated on birth rights. And he actually is kind of moving the needle as he dies, sacrifice, uh, not in vain. Well, yeah, yeah, his life, it was like the guy who, you know, the orgy doesn't start until he leaves the party. Well, if the, if the Japanese want along though, they're going to have to get rid of their, uh, their, uh, Western face because that's the wrong horse. It's not, do not stop backing the US. Okay. Apologize for an am king and get with the program. I tried whatever their plan is. I trusted. They've got the sort of, they've got the actual sort of temporal justice. Exactly. A literal anime sort of, they keep underneath the imperial palace. Like, yeah, do you think that the sort of temporal justice would even be able to like kill an average size man? Probably not. Uh, the most, uh, the, the rarest item that, uh, you know, uh, crown watchers say will not be an attendance. It will, it will not be, uh, part of the investiture is a prince Andrew's black book. Yeah. That's not going to be there. And that's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. Like dark magic home. If you give that, if you give that to an anglican priest, they'll refuse to teach you spells from it. Well, I bring up prince Andrew because we got some more, we got some more Epstein news. Drop this week about, um, who is in his role of decks. Like after he had served time for soliciting a minor for the purposes of prostitution, uh, he was having meetings with the current head of the CIA and gnome chomsky. No, those are the big headline polls from that. And, uh, Matt, you were absolutely right. Michael Parenti heads are eating on Twitter this week. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Just the old man and they're all taking a big L on this one. Yeah. Libertarian socialism. Ooh, hit the showers. But, uh, I mean, I guess like, uh, probably more of note is the current head of the CIA. And like, you went to him for like a recommendation or something. Like he was going into the private sector and he wanted like advice from Epstein on how to do the transition. Hmm. Well, you know, I mean, he's a guy who knows a lot of stuff. You know, he knows people as we know, as we've seen, not a lot of names in that black book. I say, we have also a woman named Catherine Rumler, who is a White House council under Barack Obama. I had dozens of meetings with Epstein before before becoming a top lawyer at Goldman Sachs. And then we're also finding out a lot about like Jamie Dimon's business dealings with, uh, and Goldman's business dealings with Jeffrey Epstein as well recently. But, you know, it's a, that's a, you know, it's sort of a minor detour. I mean, the gnome chapski thing is funny though. And like when people were emailing about it, he was just like, he's literally like, there's none of your business. Fuck yeah. Which is good. Yeah. Stop watching. Yeah. It was, you know, I mean, the guy does really respond to every email, but yeah, fucking apparently. Yeah. Um, this is all, I mean, yeah, this is, this is all interesting. I'm as interested in any of this is anyone else, I guess, but like, I know, it's like, you know, I feel like what was it like three or four years ago? We found out that Leon Black, the Apollo management guy, this guy is like, I think 10 civilians dollars, a super rich guy fixture on Wall Street. Um, he gave Epstein hundreds and billions of dollars for what he called tax preparation, which is H in our wild. Yeah. I mean, like, let's choose to believe that for a second. Like, let's, let's go with that story. He couldn't find anyone else. That was the only guy. That was the only fucking guy. And then, you know, there's whisperings of, oh, God, Glenn Dubin, this other hedge fund guy, maybe he bought his fucking wife for Epstein. They offered, they offered Epstein a daughter. And then it just, it just fucking nothing happens. Sometimes there are settlements like JP Morgan had to do some type of settlement, but it just, it, unfortunately, it just doesn't seem to ever go anywhere. I, yeah. Yeah. I mean, there's no one in any position of power to follow up on any of this stuff, you know? So it just floats out there and you're like, wow, that's pretty weird. And then you, yeah. Yeah. And then it just, it, it transmores into like whatever it is now where like for, for half the country, like if you, they now have like their own Epstein flight logs, where they say like John legend. I said like a con, a con. A con was there the, everyone is in the 2016 DNC fight song music video. Yeah. It's on the Epstein logs. And it's like, I'm sure some of them, but like, some of them are just fucking ridiculous. Like T pain is on there. It's a lot of R and D artists on it. Everyone from Obama's hip hop barbecue that didn't create any jobs. Yeah. Not a single job has still ever been created. Not a single job created by the hip hop barbecue. Yeah. If you read, if you see it supposed an Epstein flight log that has OG Macco on it, that's, that's not the real one. I mean, I guess like just the thing that people bring it up is just in the example of like, how many prominent people were seeking his counsel and company well after the fact that he had already been to prison for a teenage prostitution. I mean, it's just something of no, something to keep in mind, I suppose. But yeah, like this is just, this is just another tidbit that's circled the drains of people's minds and just move along because there's no word for it to go. Really? The guy's dead. Yeah. Exactly. And anything, I mean, there's a bunch of things I really desperately want to know about this. As does everyone like, you know, what was the nature of the renewed prosecution in him? Was it like, did just some do go to the US Attorney's Office go, Hey, we should get this guy and then other forces killed him or was the entire thing just an effort to corral him and snuff him out and then sort of memify all his crimes. So they become less real and become another like a femoral cultural joke. I don't know. I end it's, I don't feel like we're going to really know the answer to these things for another like 20 or 30 or 40 or 50 years, unfortunately. Yeah. I mean, the only other thing that makes sense is that it was an intentional like closing of like an account or something. Like, you know, somebody else had shown up somewhere else on a board that was in some way competing for with Epstein. I don't know. Some sort of internesting thing will never know probably. I mean, I'm like, they do guys like Epstein, which is to say guys who like run sort of a sexual slash sexual blackmail service and cultured agencies. Your Craig Spets is those accounts usually get closing, right? Like those guys don't usually retire in the die of old age. Yeah, that's true. Yeah. At a certain point, it's like how it's actually it's very similar to how in the MCU, they would get relatively unknown actors to play their big superheroes because they were relatively cheap and the, you know, the audience was interested in the character. And then, you know, after two or three movies, they get so big, so famous, they're commanding such big salaries that they just kill them off and create a new generation of superheroes. This is essentially what they do with the child trafficking ways. So who's like it too big for their British? So there's like a Miles Morales to Jeff. Yeah, exactly. Jeffrey. I'm only in 2099. Yeah, I think if there, you know, if there is, there's a great PS5 game coming. Yeah, the only question is why was there the, why was that started with a public prosecution? And that's where you got to be here. It's like some sort of, yeah, information warfare. The only thing that makes sense. Yeah, because yeah, I mean, it is the, you know, something we've referenced time and time again, that like censorship or rather control of information isn't so much. It's not done by censorship or restricting the flow. It's done by day loose. Yep. You just, you just soak the whole zone and then before you know it, people are like, oh, you know, who, you know, who else was on the flights? John Ritter. He wasn't, he didn't actually die. Yeah. Into the spider network verse. Oh, yeah. I want to, I want to bring up now. I have two clips that I'd like to play for you, just as sort of a companion contrast. And let's begin with Donald Trump talking to Steve Bannon about the premiere of the greatest musical of all time, Phantom of the Opera. I look at this beautiful letter I get from Andrew Lloyd Weber, who was big before Phantom, but nothing like Phantom and he did Jesus Christ superstar, which was another great one. He did a lot of great things, but he said because he lived in the building, a Trump tower, he knew me a little bit. And he said, I'd love to have you as my guest. I'm opening up a musical called The Phantom of the Opera. And I said, oh, so let's go. So I say you're on the letter. Okay, I'll go. And anyway, we went and it opens with the chandelier. And this you've been there, right? You see, you were the first time I saw it, shock, she went the strong, real drops. No, but the whole thing, the whole thing. It was a great, great musical. He said, but I'm opening a musical called Phantom of the Opera. And I'm saying to myself, all right, now I get many letters like that. I still get letters like that, except it's a little hard when they make you put masks on. I mean, you know, I think Broadway, you still have, it's brutal. It's brutal. I mean, if you had a Broadway theater right now, it just, it's just, well, plus the city, what's happened to the city? What's happened to the city? Look, it just closed after what 40 years this letter is from one from the running you to opening night. The reason I want to start with that, it just closed last week. Yeah, no, it did. It was very sad. It caused what's happened to the city. I think I know where it closed beyond that, but I think it's, you know, you got to have, you got to have a lot of things going right and they get so politically correct, but it did close. And I would think it's very hard to open on Broadway, have anything on Broadway, but Phantom was one of the greatest of all. So I go in and I see this music. I said, this is unbelievable. It didn't take long because the music is so good. By the time we had intermission, it was like, it said, this thing is incredible. And by the end, you know, with the whole thing, with the kind of dollars and the candles and the whole thing coming out and the great music. And we play a lot of that music. I mean, I go to places when we want background music, that's beautiful. It's great. Everybody likes it. But you go there and it's opening night for one of the most successful plays. I musicals ever. I would say maybe the most, but certainly one of the most. I love him. I love. I was talking about this. Like maybe the best perhaps I don't know, but maybe it is. It could be there is a. And Trump is really at his best. Like he's at his most human when he's sharing. He's sharing his enthusiasm for like one of the three things he actually likes. Yeah, which are like just declaring bankruptcy. But most media media, get caddiness and gossip and the classic musicals of like the golden era of Broadway. Phantom, the Phantom of the opera. And by the way, I love in this clip where Steve Benin seems to imply they're Phantom of the opera closed down after 40 years because because of the city. Yeah, Phantom of the opera opened in the 80s. Like, is he really saying that crime in New York is worse now than it was in the 80s? No, there are a bunch of hobos on stage. They can't get them off of there because of the city. Well, maybe he means it was like a municipal decision. Like David Dinkins was like enough. All right. I want to I want to contrast that clip of Donald Trump sharing his enthusiasm for Phantom of the opera. But this next clip of the most Kelvin Jim Stone as shit I've ever seen in my life from Senator Josh all the way. Speaking at some sort of reclaim masculinity conference this past weekend. The Lord wants to make you a channel of his strength and power in the world. He wants his strength, his power, his righteousness to flow through you into change the world. That's what it means to be a mighty man of valor. It doesn't mean you do it on your own strength. That's it. That's it. That's it. When you're on righteousness, what the scriptures say, all of our righteousness is as filthy rags before him. That sort of means to be a mighty man of valor. A mighty man of valor has been translated for the original air. I just like I think the contrast between these two is so funny because it speaks to like the essential bind that the GOP is in with regards to Trump. Because what I love is like the perfect contrast in these two clips. And Donald Trump, who is I would say like we discussed this on the show before Donald Trump's sexual orientation is probably ace, but like is you know, like on this spectrum. I think basically heterosexual. But all of his interests are like incredibly fruity. Yeah, like you know, like he's like the straightest man in existence who like like he is the straightest man with the most love for Andrew Lloyd Webber that like has ever existed. And and then contrast that with not just Josh Hallway, but like the entire spate of like a young new GOP contenders. And they are all they're all trying to be the exact opposite as hard as possible. You know, like like I mean Trump has authentic has the authentic interests and personality of like a gay man in his 70s. Whereas Josh Hallway like it tries. He might like he just not can he cannot create the persona of like a mighty, a mighty man of valor. And like that's that's a that's a problem for the GOP because like it seems like most of the young people in the GOP like they come across as really fruity when they try to be like the more masculine they try to appear. The fruity are they same where it's Trump. The fruity or he sounds like the more alpha he comes across. It's kind of brilliant. Well, yeah, because he is just he owns it like yeah, I like torch songs and Andrew Lloyd Webber. He's the guy who had the total of blue and this is and it all just comes from like a a narcissism that is like pure as diamond and you know elevates him above the common run of humanity. He went in front of as we said, I've said before because I can never get over it when I think about it. He went in front of a bunch of hooting West Virginia coal miners and did a tight five about how hairspray doesn't work as much as well as it used to. These guys are all deeply insecure about their masculinity and are trying to compensate for something and as such they yeah they go out for more on a limb of trying to assert this stuff and say these phrases and the more. The more you can hear the tremble in their voice. Yeah, and you know we've talked about like Rhonda Santas I don't think you really Rhonda Santas doesn't really have. They don't really have the traditional gay voice, but he does have the annoying bitch voice yeah like it's shit or man yeah. And to that end like I know we've been pretty. Pretty hard on Mr. DeSantis, but I thought it'd be necessary to maybe give the. The other side of the other side of like make the case for Rhonda Santas and I just wanted to share this brief with you this is from Mark Penn writing in the Wall Street Journal yesterday headline don't count Rhonda Santas out so this is former Clinton advisor was as a Mark Penn. Making the case for Rhonda Santas like let's see let's see if this is their best shot here let's let's take let's go get this. He writes the dissentist ship is clearly listing and must write itself I wouldn't normally give advice to a Republican candidate, but someone has to stop Donald Trump for regaining the presidency and I wouldn't count on President Biden to do it given his low job approval rating and widespread doubts about his fitness. Mr. Trump leads Mr. Biden in the real clear politics polling advantage a Trump Biden rematches a risky proposition with the Democrats consolidated around Mr. Biden the only way to avoid it is with the rupt through the Republican primary. To get back in the game Mr. DeSantis has to put cultural issues to the side and run on character competence and common sense. He has the strong character of a family man who cares for his wife a cancer survivor. I mean, I would like to make like I'm like a candidate who makes like maybe the new Gingrich style character of leaving your wife when she has cancer. But I mean like no I mean like you can see when Mark Penn has been so successful you really get what he's saying here it's really it's really smart. Rhonda Santas has to lead with his amazing personality. Yeah, but I just like like what what's on his character CV like he took care of his wife when she had cancer it's like. That's a I mean I'm like that's a good thing to do don't get me wrong that's an active love and certainly speaks to his character but like it's a low bar to clear you know like not leaving your cancer stricken wife is like. If you're putting that on your character resume I think I think it's a little thread bear. He says here the energetic competence of an accomplished governor and the common sense the campaign on such issues as a balanced budget and a workable immigration system. That's right. Yeah, it is 1996. Yeah, all right. This is like the dull campaign. Yeah, Jesus Christ. What do you guys hear? Clearly Mr Trump knows Mr. Dessantis is winning older voters and has decided that hitting the governor on social security can erode his base. Mr. Dessantis has to defend himself and prove that Mr. Trump is a big spender who will drive more inflation and increase the national debt and that he fumbled the COVID-19 response by pushing lockdowns. See like okay. Dessantis like the only thing that we talked about this the only area in which Trump could conceivably be vulnerable to a Republican primary voting population is on COVID and the vaccine and lockdowns and like the early days when he was for it. But the thing is if the early days run to Sanctus was for all like masks and lockdowns too. Yeah. So I mean like the Sanctus could go hard on the vaccine but I mean he was implicated in that too because he was like you know. I was like they all were touting it when it first came out. Yeah. But the idea of like under the fucking Trump administration it was the example of them doing a good job. Yeah. Dessantis was bragging about like you know making it so you could get your vaccine in public and shit like no one's and there are tons of pictures of him. You know, wearing a mask looking like patting. Then no one's no no one's in the clear on this. You know. Every everyone every like every elected Republican outside of like I don't know like Thomas massier someone. You've got at least some pictures of them in masks. You got you got them doing something. It's interesting to imagine what though what have happened if Trump had been president. He'd he'd won in 2020 and then they had to do a vaccination program you know with the population that was already at that point turning against them among Republicans. With how they would have squared that I think most of probably would have just eventually been like that's fine. Yeah. I think it could have been a real weird stress fracture point in the GOP but yeah. So Santis I don't think can because he was drawing a contrast with you know some of his new cycle victories that he had like a year or so ago. But nobody remembers that all you're talking about now is a campaign where both sides can show the other one. Yeah. In a mask or talking about lockdowns or vaccines. So yeah. Nothing else matters. And this is it like no matter what he does he faces the same problem which is the more people see him the less they like him. It's an impossible for him to get out of he's just you know how many I don't think endorsements are really that important. But it does tell me something that you know he'll go and meet with some fucking legislator or someone and he won't even have gotten out of the building in the guy instantly dors is Trump. There's just there's just something so uniquely fucking off putting and detestable about him. Just no one actually likes him. I am more interested in what the fuck is Josh Holly doing. What is what is you know last week we talked about you know who is the RFK campaign for who's the Marian campaign for. What is anything Josh Holly doing well who's that for. Because we know this guy with presidential ambitions but like what route is that running through. Well, I don't think it's just the internet fully internet poisons. Yeah. Yeah. Because like he has a new book out called manhood or reclaiming manhood or something like that might be interested to read that for the show. I'm sure it's funny as well. But like the conference he was speaking at like it's not just about like it is totally internet brain because like the problem with manhood is not like. Oh like you know men need to be fathers or like pay more attention to their kids or you know work to support their families. His pitch on reclaiming manhood is just stop jacking off the internet porn. Like that's a big that's a big part of his pitch. Yeah. Your attention. Yeah. Yeah. I was lucky enough to see a promo that he did for the you know mighty, mighty valorous special men of victory rally. The mighty boss tons of victory. He said. Yeah. He said something like I'm so excited. This is the biggest men's Christian conference in the world. So I guess I guess masculinity is going to be his issue, which really that presents its own problems, doesn't it? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And back to just back to Mark Penrell quick and his pitch for a ronde de Santis. It's like, okay. We talked about the one area on which Trump could conceivably be vulnerable is on COVID. We've got lockdowns and the vaccine. But then again, like anyone running against him would be just as like less trusted among the people voting for them and like just isn't just as guilty as he is at least by their by their estimation. But then I want to go back to the other thing he said about like to say this needs to stop being like a culture warrior and start talking about that Mr. Trump is basically like increased the national debt. It's like, Phil, you're right. Yeah. This is 1992. Like, it works against Democrats and it is like a package of of a greater indictments of the Democrats. It didn't matter. Everybody knows that that deficits don't matter under Republicans, including more than anyone Republican voters. What the, I mean, the deficit would be better than the fucking national debt. You might as well just declare the campaign over now. Like if that's what he's going with, it's fucking over. Nothing. Not listen to the national fucking debt. Are you Ron Paul in 2007? What the fuck is this? It's not like people in the streets. It's not getting people storming capitals. That's for sure. And like, you know, he's pot committed at this point. He can't just like repurpose himself into being like, I'm, I'm for saying national government and a balanced checkbook. When like the only juice that you've been able to squeeze thus far is about, you know, like a demonizer. He's about the gender ideologies. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Trans people. You can't do that. You can't do any of that. I mean, he's uniquely weak on everything. And by that, I mean, like the only, the only, the success he's seen, you know, as governor, which is different than running a presidential campaign obviously. The success he's seen is just, you know, passing all these laws and the signing statements and executive orders that fit with like whatever conservative issue, cultural issue of the week is. But when people actually see him pass the headlines, when national voters see him, he just, he doesn't come off as a guy who's necessarily fighting for everyone. He just comes off as completely mean and spiteful. And even to people who have the same like shitty opinions he does. There's just he's just a completely joyless humorless person with no positive characteristics. He's very nasty. Yeah, it doesn't seem like he's fighting for something. It just seems like this. He enjoys doing this, he enjoys inflicting pain on others. Yeah, he's not a happy warrior. Yeah, even to even to people who like again, have the exact same positions that is still a fucking turn off. Like Trump isn't necessarily a happy warrior, but there's some, there's some like humor there. There's some fun. Yeah, he could bust balls. He chops it up. Yeah. Like as we saw in the Andrew Lloyd Webber clip. Yeah. As we just saw it. And dude, like he was so happy. That's the only time Trump ever, like betrays any feeling of joy or like any human feelings at all is when he's just like when when I saw the chandelier and Phantom took my breath away. But like a similar to how I think for both Democrats and Republicans, the best way to deal with like COVID on the campaign trail is just a pretend it never happened. It's just like just don't like, don't make an issue at all. And I sort of feel like like last week we were talking about Nikki Haley trying to like be like the sort of alternative to Ron DeSantis. And I think it's sort of the similar to a wokeness where it's just sort of like if you're a Republican, you can be like, yeah, we're we're anti woke, but we're not annoying about it. And I think honestly, like that's the appeal of Biden. Like as a national democratic figure is that he's like, yes, yeah, Jack, I am woke, but I don't know what it even means. I just am woke. I don't know. I'm not sure if it's fine. You can be woke without being a trembling blue-haired social justice maniac. So you don't because that is the that is how they try to scare people. It's like, do you want to be like these people? And you imagine, oh, I could never tell a joke. And I'm always hence the new watch Joe Biden just roll it in completely suited out of his gourd on some sort of research chemical. Glad handing everybody a sing and Danny boy. And it's like, hell, yeah, I woke. What's the problem? Can't be too rough on the guy. After his reelection as governor, he was asked if he had a mandate. He said, hell, no, I'm straight. I'm straight. I'll give you time to think that went through. Yeah, he's a possible wokeness. I am very glad that we are we're in this position. We're Nikki Haley. I don't see her winning the cycle. Because it would just it would be kind of be like the Giuliani president. See the people feared. That's what I think it would be like. It would be horrifying. It would be for an adventure after for an adventure. But I wouldn't say I feel bad for her. But it is like, you know, in more normal conditions, you could see her having a real path here. Yeah. Because she has she has identified that exact thing, that exact middle ground of wokeness or anti-wokeness versus being annoying and not being annoying. But again, it's not 1996, unfortunately, for DeSantis. And it is not 2008 or 2012. So she has no path. I mean, I the Democratic backbench is horrible. There aren't a lot of high prospects, but holy shit are there no prospects for the Republicans either. That's true. That is true. And I got to be the winner at the end of this party cycle. I hope they just keep running increasingly old candidates against each other. I hope fucking 2032 is Mo Brooks versus Barbara McCullsky. And it's the new most important election of our lifetime. I got one. Biden doesn't run in 2024. And then we all nominate Diane Feinstein instead. Yes, yes. It's her time. It is her time. Hey, she just got over shingles. So she's ready to go. She took her cone off. She emerged from the Harkone and goo. But no, I we got bad news. Diane, Diane Feinstein has eaten half a box of frango chocolate. She shined all over the house. Yes. Like here, click to which Diane Feinstein to get well soon. Donate $3 to act blue right now. But do you think they'll like with with with Haley and Biden like the woke mind virus and the COVID virus are like very similar in that like people have like the sides have been chosen, but anyone really still like the moment about either one of them is just exhausting to everyone else. And it's just like it's not going to change. You're not going to persuade people one way or the other. But the people who are like really invested in either being four or against it or you know COVID is going to kill us all or the vaccines are killing us all or just like whatever. It's just the sides have been chosen and most people just like have just are exhausted by it. They're just like they don't want it. They don't want people to be annoying about it. Yes. One way or another. Yeah. And it's like it's a it's a difficult situation because everyone's trapped in the back draft of these social movements and political parties that are characterized in the middle if like through their media presentation as this strident obnoxious annoying avatar of everything wrong with your life in the country. And then you're responding to politics defined by the actions of those people. But you don't want to really have to think about it as much as these weirdos do. So you're left trying to like find some compromise where you're voting to hear it to represent one side or the other because there's no other option. But yes, to have it muffled like to have somebody who's going to stand between you and it rather than someone who's going to amplify it. And a guy like Biden says, I'm going to stand between you and this noise and I'm not going to amplify it. And probably the guy like the San this is he is saying loud and proud. I am going to amplify this. I'm going to be a resident tower for this fucking shit. And you know, for certain people inside the the cone, they're like, yes, give me more of this please. But the people who still make up the majority of voters, college educated, homeownering, not insanely focused on politics to the exclusion of everything else because they have lives. It just it becomes unappealing. I mean, maybe that changes, you know, conditions get worse. Eventually, the amplifier is what people want to hear in greater and greater numbers. But for now, people want a muffler. People want to damper. Just one more thing here on a big time loser, Mark Penn and his advice for run to San this year. I says here, a swable Republican voters are internationalists, not isolationists. Mr. DeSantis's recent characterization of the Ukraine war as a territorial dispute landed badly, prompting him to walk it back quickly. According to the Harris ball, the Santa supporters back Ukraine more than Trump supporters do. 58% of DeSantis supporters consider the US investment of more than $27 billion in Ukraine and justified. Well, okay, that's another reason why he's fucking dead of the water. No, again, oh, oh, oh, there's the big people of internationalists out there. They don't want to be isolationists anymore. This is all running a program from like 20 fucking years ago. No one wants to hear about this Ukraine shit either. Let alone spend $27 billion on it. This is the college. No college divide that defines the two political parties against each other now reappearing within the Republican party. And who wins that fight? We know because of the way that, uh, uh, uh, delegate votes are apportioned. Rule non-college educated voters are going to have a disproportionate say in who wins a primary. And those people don't give a fuck about Ukraine and don't want to get into it. And Trump is able to double down on that in a way that DeSantis who's got his leash, you know, to the greater party apparatus can't do. Well, uh, and then I guess just overall, what do you make of it? I mean, it's like, we said we said the other week, I sort of either of them dying. It's hard to imagine anything other than Trump Biden rematch for 2024. I mean, what a handicap just like what that will look like. I mean, do we think Biden has the inside track here or is he as vulnerable as people say he is? Because of how old then, you know, but I mean, like he's got what's his approval rating out now? What is it like? It's like, 44 years, I think. I mean, yeah, 40 years. I, there has certainly been, uh, incumbent presidents in far better positions in Biden. It's hard for me to see him losing at this point. I don't see Trump or God forbid, uh, you know, this antists or Nikki Haley or, um, you know, in a designated survivor type incident, Josh Hawley, um, winning, you know, the, um, the Great Lakes States, Pennsylvania, uh, Virginia. I just, I don't see it. It's, it's just, it doesn't look good for them. Yeah, I mean, you can, you can talk about like the real clear polling average, all you want, but I just, it's hard for me to see a path for Trump or really any Republican candidate right now. I, I, I, you don't think that Biden is favored here, but I do, it's not, for me, it's not by that much because one, you've got the economic question just up there. And they're like, who knows when that shoe is going to drop and what that's going to look like. So you have to factor that in. And then also you have the fact that, yeah, Biden is deeply personally unpopular. And then when the Democrats like exceeded expectations in 2022, you, they did it in spite of him being such a personally unpopular president representing that party. But if he's the top of the ticket, then his personal, uh, unpopularity is going to, it's going to really resonate more, uh, and like his saving grace would be that he's, would be running either against Trump, who is somebody people have a similar feeling about. By the way, you guys remember how incredibly, uh, cogent and non-insane that one debate they had, right? Was imagine what that's going to look like four years later. Right. Just get your head around that. Or he gets the Sanctus who's just this avatar of a repulsive culture war that we've seen is not going to play well in the upper Midwest. I, yeah, I mean, yeah, I don't, I would not say I would bet my life savings on it. And nor do I, you know, when I say that I think there are very few paths for the Republicans I see right now, I don't think that means, you know, Biden by five or even four. But I just, everything I've seen, I don't know, something, a few things would have to happen. Those few things can happen. I'm just saying right now it's very hard for me to see. And yeah, like, Biden, all these things are true. Biden is deeply personally unpopular. The economy, it could fuck up his chances. Any, any fucking day now between now and November. Next year, you know, he's completely fucking shop-worn and only getting worse. But the Republican Party itself just seems like a shittier and shittier operation these days. Obviously, this doesn't always matter. I mean, you know, Trump won a bunch of states that he had on the face, like bad organization in 2016. But I just, I don't think that same energy is there. Yeah, the question of energy is there like to me. Yeah, Trump's going to have a problem that he's no longer a wild card. Like when he won, quote unquote, it was because, hey, let's see what he can do. Well, now we know what he can do. Like it's a known quantity. And now he's just another fucking asshole. Yeah, yeah. He's on TV. Yeah, like that's exactly the point I was saying. And like, it's just you can say that like COVID may have given Biden the boost that he otherwise wouldn't have had to win in 2020. That that may have saved him. And like, you know, like that was, and that was a pretty close election. Anyway, but here's the thing, you're right, Matt. Trump is a known quantity now and he's a known loser. Like he's already tossed once. So that is that is greatly diminishes his his mystique and his intangible. So I'm like, I think that's the biggest handicap that he has is that he's already lost once and that he had four years as president. And he didn't fucking drain the swamp or change anything or shake things up. Really, he was just a guy on TV and then lost. Yeah, here's the other thing too though. High turnout, like a low turnout election, completely favors Joe Biden here. Yes. And that's what I'm kind of expecting. We'll get a depressed turnout election that no one really gives a shit about. Yeah, it seems like to me. Yeah, because it's a completely favors Biden. Yeah, because as we said, yeah, like if there was a new Trump who could who could spark like hit Trump like sparks and like popular consciousness, it'd be a Trump like spectacle. A new thing on the horizon. I could see that that yeah, shift towards a non-college educated people of all races moving towards Republicans. But if it's just Trump again, at some point, everyone gets bored with that. All right. Do you want to, I have a reading series for today, show. Should we close it out with this one? I hit it. All right, I have to give a shout out in a hat tip to Corpse and Orbit, Michael Judge from the death of the around death is around the corner podcast. Here comes Michael Judge. For here come to Judge, here comes Michael Judge. He shared this one with me and like it's a doozy because I remember like, I think it was our third episode of the show and I really when the show took off in my opinion is when we did the Ross Douthet sailing with William F Buckley article. Yeah. One our way now, Ducky. Well, I mean, it's taken years, but like we finally have a follow up to that article, courtesy of William F Buckley writing in the Houston Chronicle in 2004. So this is like, we're dipping into the archive for this one, but like just a return to like the classic comedy character, William F Buckley, reptile-like conservative man with a pinch edge for, let's just say the finer things in life. The headline of this editorial is what Michael Jackson, what the Michael Jackson case does to us? What the Michael Jackson case does to us? And this is Buckley is going to share his thoughts on the Michael Jackson case. So he begins, there is an aspect of the Michael Jackson affair that has been insufficiently explored. Namely, what exactly are we mad about? The general charge is that he has corrupted a young boy. The prosecutor's specific claims are that he had Angelo will call him to never land. Talked him into the same bed used by Michael, perhaps even gave him a whiff of alcohol and then off into a sexual dream land. Jackson's lawyer says the fantasy is that of the prosecution. That his client extended his 12-year-old guess nothing more than the warmth and hospitality he gives out as an expression of his nature. Yes, but did he do it? Off to a strong start. He refers to the accuser here as Angelo. I don't know why he has decided to use the name Angelo, but he refers to Angelo quite a bit in this case. Continuing, he writes, the mystery lies in our society's confusion over sexual misconduct and the causes of it. Jumped to Angelo just six years older than he is now. At age 18, he would be free of any interference by the state in his private life as we like to put it. When he is 18 plus one day, he can hire out to Hollywood studios to do live sex. He can now that the Supreme Court has swept away the cobwebs on that issue. Court other relationships with men old and young, though not under 18, even if they can't smoke together in a New York restaurant. I'm beginning to see that the contours of Buckley's argument here. I'm picking it up. It's got sort of a do with how Wilkes shall be the whole of the law if I'm to it. Continuing, if what Michael Jackson allegedly did to Angelo is proved, what exactly do we then fear for Angelo as he grows up under the shadow of the sleep in at Michaels that his senses will have been deranged? It is entirely believable that a pedophiles activity with children menaces them psychologically. What is far less clear is the suspension of any men is attaching to sexual molestation after age 18. Our sex-driven culture is in overdrive, showing no signs of alarm, let alone dismay. Reports on the Michael Jackson case bring up data on the incidents of child molestation. We learned that in the past 30 years there has been a tenfold increase in such activity. The question that is not being asked is, how is that so? Does this tell us that guardians of the law have been sleepy in the matter of preventing grown men, if that correctly describes Michael Jackson, from debatching boys? We're on our way now, Ducky. We're on our way now. It will become a little clearer. He says, let us assume what is always safe to assume that a lot of misconduct always happens and it is a matter of coincidence whether we uncover it, let alone do anything about it. We learned last week that there are 300,000 prostitutes in Spain. Well, there were 50,000 of them in Rome at the time of St. Augustine. Are we to presume that these prostitutes, male as well as female, set out in their profession because as children they were disoriented treated like Angelo and Neverland? We appear to be saying in our fullminations against Michael Jackson that he might as well have influenced Angelo toward a life of dissolution where sexual gratification dominates thought and act. But we don't speak with fork tongues. The American Civil Liberties Union stays up all night worrying, unless anyone should get in the way of Angelo's sating himself on radio and on television in movies and in books with the sap of degeneracy. But if Michael Jackson did it with Angelo at age 12, he is damned and we are prepared to lead him into prison. If the lawyer could prove that notwithstanding his young appearance, Angelo had actually turned 18 the week before Neverland, Michael Jackson would be protected by the engines of license and whatever he did. This is, all right. So I think we get his argument here. This would be a barn burner. This would be game over if there were no differences between adults and children. That is the one unfortunate thing in the way of this. But other than that, it's a great argument. He's saying like something is either that the sexual debauchery, sexual excess is wrong regardless and that the age distinction that modern society or Rex is an arbitrary one meant to obscure that fact by saying no, it's not good for kids, but it is okay for adults. And that is the lie. The reality is it's not good for anybody. And it is the state's prerogative to enforce that, not an arbitrary distinction to allow for the efflorescence of degeneracy. It's the state's job to enforce that and fucking Saudi Arabia, sure. That could be his argument, Matt, or just as easily as argument could be good. It could be that it's good for everyone. And that age is just a number as Arkely and Aliyah once said, well, no, it's it's the thing is it's neither good nor bad. It is good or bad depending on who's doing it. As that's true of anything. Like that's the the world view is that like there is no good or evil that is only the contextual right and wrong, which is determined by might by strength. Well, hierarchy. I mean, there's another thread in this article that I had this editorial that I think is interesting, which is that can you really debauch and Buckley's words a 12 year old who was listened to rap music and seen boobs and movies because he seems to be saying that like if Michael Jackson did this to a kid who was not aware of our licentious popular culture, then that would be in some way debauching or corrupting or in treating them to sup from the sap of degeneracy as he calls it. But I think he's like he sort of saying like if we can have sex and movies and music, then what Michael Jackson did is we have no right to complain about what Michael Jackson did. Continuing to write, he says there is something studiously unattractive about the particular depravity of Michael Jackson. His struggle against aging gives him absolute title to Doreen Gray, the man who tried everything science could come up with who arrest the aging of his face, but it got all ballacced up so that he now looks like a circus clown halfway through makeup. It was in a true sense charming that he thought to distract the world's attention from his problems by jumping on top of an automobile and dancing his trademark since age six. That didn't stop the fuzz, but the tides were with him singing their loyalty and devotion, signaling the public's power to relegate Angelo to nothing more than one dance step in the angelist pursuit of pleasure. William F. Buckley, folks, he's on his way now, Ducky. We're on our way now. All right, I guess we'll wrap it up there for today. Until next time, bye bye guys.",

      "podcast": "Hello Internet",
      "episode": "H.I. #66 A Classic Episode.txt",
      "text": "So, Grey, looking through our projected notes here, I think potentially we have a classic Hello Internet episode, all the major food groups are represented here. Oh boy! Oh boy! Reading between the lines that means it's an episode you're going to dread. When I think of what Brady imagines to be a classic episode of Hello Internet, all I can think of is many, many Brady segments. Yeah, that pretty much sums it up. After my success last week for the second episode in a row, I'm going to try to open up with a listener message, a listener interaction, because you know I love them and I know you hate them. I know, but no, I'm not going to let you get away with that. I don't hate them. I only include them if they're interesting. All right. That's the difference. I, too, enjoy the interesting ones. That's why I leave them in. Okay. Well, let's see how this one feels. I went to what I sometimes refer to as the Hello Internet postbox the other day. Okay. Essentially, this is my postbox. So if there's something you want to send to Gray, do not send it to this postbox, because I will bin it. I will not give it to Gray, because I cannot set that precedent. You mean your PL box? That's what you're talking about. The one we used for the election. That's the Hello Internet postbox. Yes, exactly. Okay. So I went along. I went along for a check. Hoping there might be a few new postcards. There was a package. No. There were several packages, actually. Oh, my. That sounds like something I would hand over to the police. Well, yes. Anyway, I opened this package. It is a book. Now, for background, people might remember my thoughts on the book, Getting Things Done by David Allen. This is a book that Gray, I think, holds in quite high regard. And I did not enjoy this book so much. The extent where I got a refund on my audiobook, because I didn't want it. And my hard copy, we auctioned for charity. I wanted this book out of my life. This book was not for me. I will. I will put the show where we discussed it. One of my favorites in the show notes. Again, I think you misrepresent me here. I'm not exactly sure that it was an unambiguous hold in high regard on my part, but I will let the listeners decide if that was a fair characterization. Okay. Anyway, like a bad penny. That has sent me a copy of this book. It's got another copy. I'm thinking, ah, what's all this about? So I open it up. And on the inside cover, the front inside cover, whoever has sent this has inscribed a small flaggy flag. So immediately a loud bell start ringing. This is obviously a mischief maker, Rebel Scum. They're up to no good, obviously. And then on the next page, inserted between the pages is a beer coaster, like a beer mat with a web address on it. And I'm thinking, ah, no, what's going on here? This is dodgy. And it's an imgirl, im juror, however, I'm supposed to pronounce that address. So they want me to look at some photo. But then before I look at the photo, I turn the next page. I love how you keep going into this. Who knows what's coming, but Brady is going to find out, right? Okay. It's an adventure. Now on the next page, which is kind of like the title page, is an inscription. Okay. What does that say? It says, too, Brady Harin, give it another go. And I'm going to guess, is that like David Allen's signature on the body? It is David Allen's signature, because if you go to the imgirling, which I'm sending you now, we have someone who I don't know who this is, they're obviously a mischievous Tim, holding a copy of the book, standing with David Allen at a book signing. So he has obviously taken his book up to David Allen and asked him to sign it to me, asking me to give it another go. That is fantastic. A few things come into my mind when I see this. The first is, I have to say David Allen has gone up a few pegs in my standing. Oh, has he? Yeah. But secondly, how did that interaction work? What did he say to David Allen when he was asking him to sign the book and say, can you please say, you know, to Brady, give it another go? He must have had to explain, oh, there's this podcast and there's this guy and he really slagged off your book and he said it was really boring and he like got rid of his copies. So you should listen to the episode. It's really entertaining. He tries to put it in the show notes. Right. How do you think that unfolded that interaction? I mean, again, here is the thing, the way you imagine stuff Brady is that someone goes into all of the details. But I would suspect that this magnificent Tim was pulled this off would simply just say, oh, I have a friend who tried the book and didn't like it. Could you give them a suggestion to give it another try? I think that's the fastest way in a book signing line to get the basic just a bit across. I don't know, Greg. Maybe I'm reading too much into the picture, but if you zoom in on David Allen's face in that picture, I sent you. He doesn't look happy. He does look a little bit like he's been cornered into doing something he didn't want to do. Or am I just reading too much into that? Because on the cover, he looks all smarmy and tan and happy and Californian. And in this picture, he looks a bit like just get me out of here, man. Get me out of this photo. Looking at that picture, I can see why you think that. It also looks like maybe he is suppressing a bit of a smile. Like maybe he thinks this is some kind of funny situation. His expression is hard to read, but you're right. Maybe he just concorded and he wants to get out of there and someone has just told him an overly long, overly detailed story in order to get them to sign this book. I day like the Tim, magnificent Tim. I can't help but wonder. It must be a weird experience to do a book signing of a book where your own face is on the cover where everyone is constantly handing you a book with a picture of you smiling at you to then sign. If I was an author, I wouldn't want my face on the cover of the book. I would find that a weird situation signing books with my own face on it. I think if you've signed off on having your face on the cover, you're the sort of person who would probably quite enjoy signing a book with your face on the cover. You might have a point there. I might not be thinking this through all the way. This is an excellent, excellent listener interaction. I don't see any way that I can possibly cut this from the show, which makes you two for two in your gambling of openings here. All right. Very well done, Brady. And thank you, magnificent Tim, whoever you are. If you do hear this, tell us about this interaction with David Allen. We want to hear every detail, every nuance, every tick, every little bit of body language on a full briefing. Yes. Brady wants to hear that. All of that full briefing, it might not make it into the next show. You owe me $100, Brady. Well, after I made that bet with you, and for those who have forgotten, Gray went to VidCon, and I made a bet that he would get dragged up to do like a panel or talk or something like that. And he bet me $100 he wouldn't. And on the face of it, I thought that was a good bet. And very quickly after making it, I realized it was a mistake. And it wasn't a mistake for the reason that you think it's a mistake. It wasn't a mistake because Gray is like a recluse or shy or doesn't like attention. That those things are true. But Gray is also like, you do public things now. And you've started to do more of it. And also you are like a nice guy and someone who likes to please his friends and his colleagues. Okay. Interesting. No, I think it's true. You will help your friends if they ask you. I imagined a scenario where someone was going to say, you Gray come up and do this panel, I help us out with this Q&A because everyone loves Gray to be a nice surprise. And I thought, put in that situation, you would agree to it. The thing that I didn't take into account is how unlikely it was that would happen. Because people don't like giving up their stage. And what person doing a Q&A or a panel is going to want to give up their limelight to someone else. You know, these are like YouTube celebrities who love the limelight. So it suddenly occurred to me, hang on. Gray probably won't even get asked to do this. So he'll never have to refuse. So come on. Did you get asked? I went into acting with people essentially pre-shut down any discussion of joining any panels by always saying, I'm just here as a civilian, I'm just here as a tourist, I'm not doing anything. I'm just here as a normal guy, just a normal person with a VidCon pass. That's what I was trying to pitch myself to in every single interaction. And so remarkably, no, I did not get asked to do anything. But I also agree with you that my interesting experience of VidCon was over and over realizing like, oh, this is obviously where all of the extroverts go. These are all of the people who love to be on stage, who love to be in front of huge audiences. Like by definition, if you are a huge YouTube star, you are probably that kind of person. You're probably not a huge introvert. Like there are exceptions to that, but for the most case, that's the way it's going to work. And so you are definitely right that there may have been an element of who wants to invite an additional person up on their panel. Nobody. You do that. Everybody wants the panel to be as much about them as they can possibly have a be. So I mean, that's it. I was right. I mean, I was wrong, but I was right and why I was wrong. As soon as I made the bet, I realized my mistake was not graze introversion. It was everyone else's extraversion. It was their unwillingness to share the line. So I owe you $100. You owe me $100. And because of Brexit, which we may discuss later, I need to do a bit of horse trading about what the best way to give you that money will be as the pound plummet. I don't know how I'm going to do this, but I'll try and find a way to do it that won't bankrupt me. Right. $100 or $5,000. Right. You're a choice. So I lost the bet. So while I was at VidCon, we had just recorded that morning and we had had our big discussion about the Snapchat. How does it work? Our friend Destin of Smarter Every Day just kept pushing me to join Snapchat. That dude, that dude, right? He was like a Snapchat drug pusher. Every conversation. I think he must have stuck in the Snapchat. I honest to God. That was what I was thinking too. He was like, you are so pushing this. I'm just going to assume that you're a secret co-founder of Snapchat. Nothing else makes any sense here. It was one of those things where the more someone talked, the less and less I was convinced every second. We had had this whole conversation where you tried to explain it to me. Then I had Destin showing me all of the amazing things that you could do on Snapchat, including a moment which I totally loved where we were just having as you do, I hopped for dinner in America. Then whips out his phone and he's like, look, look at this thing that you can do. I can just film you and your hands eating your dinner. Isn't this great? This is going to go up on Snapchat immediately and people can look at it. I want nothing to do with the Snapchat. The more you're trying to convince me, the less convincing this absolutely is. He was super excited about that video. He asked me the other day if I want the original footage. I think he thinks it's the subruder film or the mood landing or something. He raised hands on the Snapchat. It was your Snapchat debut or something. Maybe there's something about that video I've missed, but I sort of watched it and thought it's just a dude filming another dude's hands eating food and the dude sounds unimpressed about being filmed. Yeah. The thing that I didn't even understand is it seems like Snapchat just like Twitter has a character limit. Snapchat has some kind of time limit for what it's recording. When he was trying to explain it to me, it just cuts off in the middle as I get great. You're totally selling this thing. You want to film a thing. We're talking about it and then it just cuts off in the middle anyway. This is awful. This is terrible. But nonetheless, while I mentioned in the last show that I made a little note for my assistant to make me a Snapchat, just like someone totally out of touch would do, after the show, I forgot to delete that little instruction. I have actually ended up with a Snapchat. I thought, okay, just for completeness is sake. I'm going to install it on my phone and just see what it looks like. Maybe I'll do one thing and then I'll just never do it again. I just want to reiterate a thousandfold your described experience of even installing and using Snapchat at all is a completely baffling experience. Thank you. Thank you. I did have a lot of people saying it wasn't just you, Brady, but having it come from you is vindication because you're pretty up with the tech. I thought you might be exaggerating or just totally out of touch. Trying to get that thing installed and looking at the instructions, I thought, okay, I have to put this in. Okay, get this thing, take a picture of this. Then when it loads up, there's no labels on any buttons. The buttons seem intentionally obscure and somehow throughout the entirety of everybody describing it to me and everybody showing it to me, I somehow missed that it was purely video, that there was literally nothing you could do aside from video. As soon as I figured that out, I was like, oh, they're hell with this and I just deleted it off my phone. You can't take stills. Oh, okay. Well, I didn't get that far. But you just tap for that video button instead of holding it down. Oh, okay. It's completely baffling, great. It's like that it's seen in movies when people get into the alien spacecraft and there's like all different symbols on the dashboard and yet somehow they still manage to fly the spaceship. I feel like that's what the whole world is like with Snapchat. Flying the spaceship with symbols and controls. None of us understand. Anyway, I just have to completely agree with you. I feel like I was glad to have the experience of maybe 90 seconds of playing around with Snapchat just to see what it was like and then realizing, no, but I have no place for this in my life. It brings me absolutely no utility, no matter how much destined keeps pushing it, no matter how much he wants to drive up the value of his stocks in Snapchat. I am not going to use this thing. To be fair, it suits Destin because he's such a nice guy and he's really charming and he really likes interacting with as many people as possible and he lives in this world where his day lasts and 90 hours. So he has time to do this. As far as I can tell, he does not sleep. As I said before, I think it's less you. There has been an interesting development in the world of Snapchat since we spoke. You know how we have this delusion that like the world changes and continents move based on things we talk about on Hello Internet. I don't think it is a delusion. I think the more episodes we do, the more confirmation bias we have for this. Well you may remember, I think I mentioned this on the podcast and it was certainly something I felt. I felt a frustration about not being able to take past material and media and put it on the Snapchat. It always had to be immediate like I had to take a picture now and put it on. I couldn't go and get those beautiful pictures from Mount Everest five years ago and brag about that on Snapchat because you can't go and get stuff from the vault. Right, for a shame. Yeah. The funny thing is, within a day or two, I realized the error of my ways and I realized the strength of Snapchat was this immediacy. People couldn't Instagram it and make their lives look all amazing. It was unvarnished. It was like this really nice immediate contact. Everything disappears in 24 hours. The blackboard is constantly being wiped clean and I realized this was what was good about it and I embraced that now and then about a day or two after that, Snapchat Announce. They are now allowing people to do the exact thing that I wish they did and now I wish they wouldn't do but they are doing and you can take things from the vault and create this new area of Snapchat which I haven't looked at yet and I don't know how it works. I think it's called memories or something like that. In addition to your immediate day to day story, you can now go and get your perfectly crafted photos and Photoshop them and have nice vignettes and make everything look perfect and pretty and not the crazy unvarnished Snapchat which I think works better. It's all changed. Well, I trust that now that you have explained to Snapchat the errors of their ways, they will quickly revert this decision. If you've got a phone or a camera or a computer full of photos, why not liberate at least some of them into the real world? Nothing beats having some of your favourite memories hanging on the wall, sitting on the mantel piece or maybe poached on your desk and one of the best ways to do this is with fracture. Fractures are great service which prints your photos onto a piece of glass ready made for display. These bits of glass have a special rigid backing to make sure it's easy to hang but the product is super light really easy to handle. All you've got to do is simply upload the picture to their website, pick a size and fracture will do the rest at their factory or fractry in Florida. I've done it myself, it's painless and a pleasant process. I especially recommend fractures as gifts. If you've got a relative or a friend or a partner and you're stuck for a gift idea, you can never go wrong with a nice sentimental photo and having it fractured onto glasses also a real talking point when you give the present. It doesn't even have to be a birthday or an anniversary or anything like that, just give one as a gift out of the blue. That earns you even more branny points. Fractures are clean, frameless and beautifully finished. They come with a 60 day happiness guarantee. I'd recommend just having a look at their website to get you started. That explains everything really well and there's lots of pictures showing how it all works and what the finished product is going to look like. That website is fractureme.com. If you do order something, you'll get 10% off your first order by using the code HelloInternet. That's 10% off HelloInternet and they'll know you came from the show. Thank you to Fracture for their support and seriously give them a look. It's a really nifty product. So we have to talk about flags if we're going to have a classic episode. No. And we probably have to talk about emojis. Okay, okay. I have an emoji flag story. Oh, do you? A submission has been prepared and again, I'll try and link to it. I think it's been done by these people from emoji pedia and people in the emoji world have put in this formal submission to whoever you have to formally submit things to to have emojis recognized, to have the home nation flags made into official emojis. Because at the moment, there is the Union Jack representing the United Kingdom. But there is no England flag, there is no Wales flag, there is no Scotland flag. And I've actually found that quite frustrating. There have been times believe I'm not where I've wanted to use those flags and have been unable to literally not more than three hours ago. I wanted to send someone an England Wales emoji flag thing and discovered for the very first time that those home nation flags don't exist. I just assumed that they would be there, but they're not. Yeah. So I know there are sort of thin ends of the wedge and you can open the floodgates and where does this stop. But I think the home nations should be in the emoji sphere and I hope that this submission is successful. Well, I mean, if they're going to do the home nation flags, I think they absolutely have to do all 50 state flags. I think there's no way around that. No, this is not the case because I beg to disagree. And obviously they have to do the Liberian county flags. But yes, of course, right, just for fun, Z's, those need to be in there. Yes, I agree. But this home nation thing has been causing significant problems. For example, the European football championships, which are finishing today as we record the finals actually on shortly. There's no United Kingdom team in that. There's all these international teams and we have Wales competing and we have England. The same is true of the World Cup of Football. Now, Texas and California and Nevada and whatever don't have teams competing at the World Cup. But Scotland and Wales and England, these are countries, these are states. It actually causes formatting problems for some people who depend on emojis when all these tournaments take place. And I mean, I know there's more to the world than sport. But I was going to say, yes, I find you're solely because there are sports competing things not super convincing. Home nations and sports is always such a confusing, weird, historical thing that occurs that doesn't necessarily make any sense whatsoever, especially when you look at the population breakdown of Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland versus other places. So I'm definitely going to say this that if the home nations get accepted, I think the Moji committee or whoever is in charge of this, I think they have to do the individual state flags. I think there's no argument around this. I don't find your sports thing convincing. Just seriously for a moment, do you seriously believe that? Yes, I think they should do the state flags. What about the state flags of Australia? You know, I mean, let's be honest, who cares? Oh, so America can have its state flags. It's exactly right, exactly right. Listen, who cares? Right? Nobody. How often have you ever wanted to use a state flag for one of the states in Australia? Never. How often does someone from Texas want to use a Texas flag emoji? I bet every day of their life, Texans are sad that they don't have an official Texas emoji to use. I bet they're sad every day. Sad Texans in their hats. Yeah, well, is there not an emoji of like a cowboy hat or something? It's not the same as Texas. You know, and think of all of those states, they could have such a beautiful field of barely distinguishable blue icons with some kind of muddy yellow logo in the center. Each of them to pick from it. It could be amazing. I can already foresee the day where on the four inch screen of my iPhone SE, I am trying to distinguish the New York state flag by looking for a tiny, exelsie or written at the bottom of a banner or a smiling sun face in the middle of a field in the background, trying to distinguish that from all of the various other blue flags with a seal in the center. I look forward to that day. It could an emoji possibly contain the spectacular horror that is the Maryland state flag. I wonder how many pixels by how many pixels a standard emoji is. I mean, Apple did just make an announcement that they're going to embiggen their emoji by three times, even still I can easily imagine that when you have to pick it out in that tiny little keyboard at the bottom, there's simply no way to distinguish the flags and the Maryland flag. At least you'll be able to pick it out, but how much detail will it accurately represent of their flag? I bet none. In all seriousness, I do realize there would be a greater demand for American state flags than any other state flags. Of course. But you cannot put the American state flags in at the expense of other country states and counties, whereas I think the home nations of the UK, while not being quite as fully flared, don't get angry Scottish people as other countries, I think has a higher ranking and should be brought into the fold before we even have the conversation about state flags. Yeah, but how many people even live in Wales? I have to look this up now. Like 100,000 people. They just made the semi-finals of the Euros. More people live in Wales than Iceland, maybe. I haven't checked that fact. Yeah, I know. What is it? What have we got here, Wales? How many people do you live in Wales? Okay, there are 3 million people in Wales. Oh, that's way bigger than Iceland. And Iceland get an emoji? That's true. Iceland do get an emoji, but at least they are a fully sovereign nation. Oh, like they're on the world stage there. I agree. And that's why they're in and Wales is not yet. But I think Wales needs to come in before something even less sovereign, like Maryland. But does sovereignty matter or does the number of people in the world have that? I'm just saying, like we have to start somewhere, right? It's like, okay, we're starting with all the sovereign nations. Okay, obviously done. Although actually do they have all of the flags for the nations? I don't even know. I'm sure there's some nation out there that's really angry. Is there a Vatican city flag? I don't actually know. I wonder. But after that, I think you have to start looking at populations. And that's why I think you have to go with those state flags. Figure, you know, California, Texas, New York, there's hundreds of millions of people that live in those states. Well, hang on then. Are we going to start having like provinces of China before we have Texas then because they've got more people? Yeah, I could get behind that. Ah, go away. We've made it clear that the decision is based on sovereignty. That decision has been made. Okay, so we did the sovereignty level. And then I think after sovereignty, then you started looking at like what's the market demand for a California emoji versus a Northern Ireland emoji? Okay, great. I'm with you then. So are you now saying if all the Texans want a Texas emoji for some little tiny state, I don't know. What's the smallest state in America? I don't even know. It's the smallest in population. Like a Wyoming, of course. Wyoming is going to be a lot of us. Okay, Wyoming. And say there's not much demand from them. Does that mean they don't get into the emoji but Texas do? Or because we have one state flag of America, we get all the state flags at once. You have to do them as a collection, right? We do them as a collection. That's that's that's my argument. Okay, you can start with the Chinese provinces. Do them all as a collection and then move on to the American states. There's only so much labor we have in the world to create all of these emoji. Can you hear that, Gray? Can you hear that sound? What sound is that? The sound of your argument crashing down around you. I think it's perfectly solid. We have all the nations and then let's start going through everything else in the world by population divisions as sets though. I think I did notice in the submission and I could be wrong on this. In this submission, they were going for Scotland, Wales and England. But I don't remember saying Northern Ireland in the submission. Yeah, see now it's not even consistent. If that's true, that is inconsistent, maybe it's not true. But I did want to quickly ask you because we just love talking about flags and this is a classic episode. Right, of course. I know how you feel about the Union Jack. You think it's awesome. How do you feel about the flags of England, Scotland and in particular, Wales? Oh, I love that side. It says to me, Grace, taking this really seriously and you so rarely take me seriously that it makes me feel good. It's like you're settling in. I'm not just going to shoot from the hip on that one. This is going to require consideration. Like shoot from the hip. I don't think I shoot from the hip. I don't think you put a lot of thought into your answers when I ask you questions about say the black stump. I think you've just say anything to shut me up. But when you go, I can feel your brain warming up as you start to think about it. I love thinking about it. How do I feel about those various flags? I mean, the England one makes me kind of sleepy. I think the England one is a little boring. Do you know what I mean? I literally get kind of sleepy when I look at it. Yeah. But do you know what? Those really, really boring flags like England, which is from those who don't know, is just white with a red cross on it. Those flags say to me, this country's old man. This country's seen some stuff because the more boring your flag, usually the older you are because you didn't have to do anything complicated because they weren't that many other flags to compete with. So when someone's got a really, really boring flag, it says to me, you've got to take them seriously, man. They've seen stuff you can't even imagine. Like if you're a new country, like America, it's like, oh, let's just chuck some stars on there and some stripe. No, more stars, more stars. We've got to bling this baby up, man. You've got to get noticed. Whereas England's like, we don't need to be noticed, man. Like we're England. Just a cross on a white background. Yeah, that's all we had when we were making flags. Stars hadn't even been invented yet. Yeah. And also we couldn't die cloth. So that's why it's white. I guess I can try to incorporate that into my thoughts on it, but it's still just kind of makes me sleepy. Okay. Scotland, which is the, what's it called? The Saltaire isn't it? St Andrews Cross, isn't that it? It says here on my Google that Saltaire is another term for St Andrews Cross. So okay. Even though in theory the Scottish flag is essentially kind of like the same as the English flag because it's just now a white cross on a blue background, I feel like the Scottish flag is so much more exciting. It doesn't make me sleepy at all looking at it. I definitely give a thumbs up to the Scottish flag without a doubt. Yeah, I have to agree with you. I have to agree. I like the navy blue, the background of it. I just, I think it's, I think it's a very good color. Would you say navy blue? Yeah, maybe navy blue is not right. Navy blue is too dark. Yeah. I do not have a word in my vocabulary for the color of blue that the Scottish flag is, but I feel like it is identifiable as this Scotland blue color. I definitely like it. All right. Then what do we have here? I mean, the way I was flagged, I'm very curious to hear what you think of it. I mean, you have to talk about the Ulster banner for Northern Ireland. Well, I think in keeping with this submission, maybe we should just pretend it doesn't exist. Okay, sorry, Northern Ireland, we're going to skip you for today, which actually makes sense thematically for a thing that I'm going to show you and ask about. So whales, I don't know. I don't know about the whales flag. I'm never quite sure what to think about it, because on one hand, they have a dragon which takes up most of the flag and dragons are awesome. It's hard to argue against dragons, but at the same time, I'm not really sure that I like that dragon. I think like with many flag designs can suffer from being overly complicated and yet kind of childish at the same time. I have funny mixed feelings about that dragon. This is probably the best way to summarize my thoughts on the whales flag. The further away from it I am, the more I like it. But the closer I get to the whales flag, probably the less I like it. I think the whale flag is awesome. I realize that I probably shouldn't and I realize you probably shouldn't. I mean, certainly no child could draw it because that dragon is incredibly complicated. And you're right, it is a weird mixture of childish and complicated. I don't know. I think it's one of those things that's just been part of my life for so long that I kind of ignore that side of it. I just think it works. It just suits the country. And I don't know if it's because it actually suits the country or they've just been associated for so long in my head that I can't disentangle them. Right, this is of course the association problem that all these flags have. Where you are wrapping up your feelings of the nation with the flag itself in a way that's impossible to distinguish. Yeah. And I really like whales and I really like Welsh people because I'm not English. Most English people don't, but I'm not actually English, of course. I'm Australian. And because Welsh people hate English people and Australians hate English people, I feel like they're my brothers. Wow. Leave your comments on the reddit. That's some A plus tribalism right there, Brady. Dude, it all comes down to sport. So I think I'll ask your opinion on is I actually think that the Welsh dragon looks better simply as an outline, which I've seen in a few design motifs. Like if you just color the whole thing in as red, I think it's interesting. And there is a proposed version of the Union Jack flag, which I would like your opinion on, which combines the whales flag into it. Because right now there is no whales iconography on the Union Jack as it stands. So I have sent you an image and I'm curious to see what you think of this flag. OK. No fail. Fail? Not just because it's too bitty now and too complicated and the dragons too small. But also what Grey has sent me is essentially the Union Jack with a little tiny dragon right in the middle. And it almost puts too much emphasis on the dragon because everything's pointing at it and it's right in the center and it suddenly makes whales seem like it's the center of everything. That's a big fail. Big fail, huh? Big fail. What about you? What do you think of that? I think it's interesting, but it's also one of these things like mandatory voting that I can ever come to a solid opinion on. Every once in a while I remember this design of flag with the whales dragging in the center exists and I go back and I look at it. And I can never quite make up my mind about whether I like it or whether I don't, just like with mandatory voting. I go back and forth forever for 20 years about whether I think it's a good idea or not and I feel that exact same way about this flag. You can't mess with the Union Jack, right? That's like if you get a mess with that, where do you stop? Yeah, don't get me wrong. I would never propose that we actually change to this flag. It's just a question of do I think this is an interesting design or not? No, the Union Jack is an amazing flag. That will hopefully but possibly not live forever. I am keen to talk to you about Tesla because we didn't talk about it last time, but I know you had a ride in a Tesla for the first time. You broke your Tesla virginity. I want to know what you think about it. Now you've been in one. It's like obviously it's all more real. I was wondering if you'd tell me anything about it. I haven't asked you on or off the air and I'm really keen to know. Yeah, so our mutual friend Marco Arment actually gave me a ride in his Tesla. That was part of my travels this summer when I went to New York and it just worked out that I happened to be able to possibly meet up with Marco and then he dangled the idea of being able to ride in a Tesla in front of me and I was like, sold. I have to make this happen now. I went up to meet him and we got to drive around in the Tesla for a little while. First of all, Teslas are just super cool cars. There's no doubt about that. They just look cool from the outside. They're not looking. I had never actually sat in one on the inside and on the inside as well. The Teslas are just cool. Everything about them is super sleek, I think. One of the things that I wanted to see in the Tesla when we were driving around that is hard to get a sense of from just looking at pictures is how does this big screen work in the center because that's such the different thing about the interior of that car versus other cars? I kept looking out on the road as we're driving around and trying to see how does this screen work in my peripheral vision and especially because I am someone who, the older, I get I find I have more and more motion sickness in cars if I look down and look up even briefly to read. It's kind of curious to see if I'm looking out the window and then looking down at the screen and looking back up. I have to say because the screen is so huge, I think it really works on the interior. It was nice to see that they had thought through a bunch of clever design elements about how to control a bunch of things from the steering wheel or sections of the screen that never, ever, ever change so that in the bottom corners you can always have muscle memory for making the car do certain things. I think like temperature controls and some other stuff was down there. From the inside I was very, very impressed with the Tesla. I have to say I quite liked it. So Marco was showing off the super fast acceleration which I did not like because I don't appreciate the sensation of super fast acceleration though it was very impressive. I was like, you can keep showing this off if you don't mind cleaning the interior of your car shortly. That's a game you can play if you want to. But a bunch of the things that the car does as well just seem so natural. For example, there's no jarring because of gear changing. It just seems like this is the way cars should work. You don't miss it at all. Boy, I wish this car was really janky. Is it accelerated as it tries to manually shift through gears? It doesn't do that at all. That's fantastic. Then finally, the thing that I was most interested to see was a lot of the self-driving stuff in person. And I know that I am the wrong person to evaluate this in some ways because it's a thing that I have a lot of interest in. But I felt again, the self-driving stuff was all so natural that it was entirely unremarkable. There was no moment of, wow, I'm in a self-driving car and watching this thing trying to navigate the highway and stuff is like, yeah, this just seems natural. Just like no gear shifts, the self-driving stuff. It seems like this is just the way cars should work. This is the way I want these things to work. Does it just applaud along in its line? Like it doesn't change lines and do overtakes does it? Like how much does it do on its own at the moment? Yeah, so this was one of the things that it was a bit of a funny experience because in the discussion of how soon our self-driving cars coming, Marco owning a Tesla and actually using self-driving features thinks that I am being overly optimistic about how soon these things are going to arrive. And part of what he wanted to show me in the demo was situations under which it doesn't work or it doesn't always do precisely what you would expect it to do. And so he was trying to show me a bunch of this stuff. But my experience of sitting in the car was mostly thinking like, I think the car is doing pretty well. I think this is going great. There was a situation where we were on the highway and he has his hands off of the wheel on the car is driving on the highway. And what it does is it stays in its own lane and it tries to keep an appropriate distance from the car in front of it. But you can tell the Tesla I would like to turn lanes without actually forcing it to and so the car makes a decision about whether or not it's going to change lanes. And so Marco was able to essentially put the car in a situation where he told it to change lanes but the car wouldn't even though there was nothing blocking the way. The Tesla clearly thought that there was some reason it shouldn't change lanes even though everything was fine. Like a human driver would think it was okay. And I was looking at that and thinking, yeah, that's a mistake. The car should be changing lanes but it's not. But if the thing is overly cautious, I can hardly fault it. Yeah. I mean it's a pretty amazing thing. It's like God has parted the Red Sea and people are complaining that the sand is still a bit damp. Yeah, it's like, oh my feet are getting wet. I mean, I would be remiss therefore to not now bring up the fact we did have our first death. Yeah. In a Tesla, this obviously has crossed your radar. A Tesla had a crash while in this auto drive mode and lots of people have said, oh, I want to say about that. So what does Grace say about that? Well, it had to happen, didn't it? Yeah, that's exactly it. It was absolutely inevitable that somebody would die eventually in a Tesla. And I think the very fact that that is a news story goes to show you how like this is incredibly rare. And I forget what the numbers are, but Tesla came out with the numbers, but like how many millions and millions of human miles have been driven in the auto pilot system. And now we finally have one person has died. To me, this stuff is always just a question of there's some group of people who think it needs to be perfect before people start using it. And I am not in that group. My only question is, is it better than human drivers? And again, like the Tesla can't drive point to point. There's lots of things it can't do. There's lots of ways it's kind of cheating. So like one of the things Marker showed me that I didn't know is that on local roads where the Tesla is clearly much more uncertain about turns and speed limits and all the rest of this, it has a kind of cheating mode where it'll follow a car in front of it on local roads in situations where it seems like it couldn't self drive itself. And I thought, oh, that's interesting. This is a case where yes, on a local road, it is much more limited and it does weigh better on a highway. So again, this stuff isn't self-self-driving, but it's like, I really feel like it's going to be better than human drivers very shortly. Yes, people will die, but horrific numbers of people die on the roads right now. So when people sent via Twitter in a whole bunch of other ways, like, oh my gosh, what do I think about someone dying in a Tesla? It's like, well, I don't really think about it very much. I just do not think it matters. I don't think it's an important news story in any way. Do you disagree with that? No, I don't actually. I agree with you. I mean, I don't want to sort of fire up the cheer pressure or have people pile on. And I know there's all this debate about the incident itself. But if it was caused by the fact that the camera and the computer couldn't tell the difference between the white side of a lorry and the white sky, that is quite a motive. It's quite a good, scare story. And if that is the case, I hope they fix it. But I kind of agree. Let's speak cliche, but you know, people die and blame crashes all the time. It doesn't stop us flying and things like that. So I think it's not like a big, big deal. But this move to self-driving cars is less of a technology battle and more of a battle for hearts and minds. I have to say, I've come to your way of thinking. You know, I always thought this was further away in the future than you did. And I now think it's closer. It just seems to be all happening so quickly now, so many trials, so many implementations in sort of real-world environments that I thought was a bit further down the road. It's already happening. So I'm sort of thinking, Gray was right on this one. I think this is going to happen quick now. A question I have for you because you are much more plugged into the news than I am. Because my only experience of hearing about this story is people individually contacting me about it. But I'm willing to bet that this story is not gaining a huge amount of traction. It is a news story. And of course, the news is filled with anomalous events, that's basically what the news is, a collection of things that are unusual. But is this gaining lots of traction? Like are people super concerned? Or is this just yet another in the endless stream of news stories that just washes by, that nobody really cares about two weeks later? It happened at a good time for Tesla because there are so many other massive things happening in the world at the moment that in the fight for news time and coverage, it probably didn't get as much as it could have. But it got fair big, it got fair big. And it's still coming up. It's still being brought up in articles and I'm still seeing it around the place. When you say it's a battle for hearts and minds, I'm not even convinced that that's the case. I think there has been a real silent shift in people's thoughts on self-driving cars. I have a feeling that much, much more of the population feels that, oh, this is just a thing that's coming. And I don't bet that this is going to be like a big story that causes problems for Tesla in the long run. I have a hard time imagining that's going to be the case. I think you're right. I think the only thing that's going to hurt Tesla and the other people advocating self-driving cars will be. It will be a spate or like some kind of glitchware three or four happen in the same way. So I think you're right. I think the one off hasn't hurt them really badly. And they'll only get hurt if there's some systematic problem. It was there anything you didn't like about the Tesla? Well, it was funny because when I was sitting in the car and we're driving along the road, I'm thinking, wow, everything in this Tesla seems amazing. I love this future space car. I wish I could have any reason to buy one. No reason at all. I wish I could have reason to buy one. I asked Marco the same question. I said, is there anything about this car that you don't like? And he had a couple of minor dislikes about it, but overall, he seemed really, really happy with the car as well. And so I feel like I had nothing in particular to say, like, oh, I didn't like this about the car. It struck me as totally wrong. And the owner of the car had a few complaints, but nothing I can even remember at this later point of being like, oh, wow, that's a really good point. That is a really annoying feature that I wouldn't have thought about or wouldn't have realized until I own it. It's just like, nope, everything about this car seems amazing. So two thumbs up for Tesla. This episode of HelloInchNet is brought to you by Igloo. Now many of you might be working at a big company with an internet that is just a terrible, terrible piece of software to work with. I mean, actually, is it even really a piece of software? It feels much more like it's a bunch of pipes connected to old computers held together with duct tape. Most intranets are just awful. I used awful intranets at my school, but Igloo is something different. Igloo is a feeling of levity compared to other intranets because Igloo is an internet you will actually like. Go to igloosoftware.com slash hello. And just take a look at the way Igloo looks. They have a nice, clean, modern design that will just be a relief on your sad, tired eyes compared to the internet that you are currently working with at your company. And Igloo is not just a pretty face. Igloo lets you share news, organize your files, coordinate calendars, and manage your projects all in one place. And it's not just files in a bucket either. Their latest upgrade Viking revolves around interacting with documents, how people make changes to them, how you can receive feedback on them. If you're the man in charge, there's an ability to track who has seen what across the internet. So you can have something like read receipts in email where you know if everyone has actually seen and signed off on whatever document they need to. So if your company has a legacy internet that looks like it was built in the 1990s, then you should give Igloo a try.

Brady's paper cut. There's a lot of sport going on in the world at the moment, Gray. Oh boy. There always seems to be eye na to you. Isn't there always sports? There should always be sport because people love sporting events. So there should always be sporting events going on, right? Yeah, but there's been a rich vein just lately. Oh, okay. Anyway, anyway, like always. Yeah. So everyone's saying to me, oh tell Gray about Iceland at the Euros or Wales at the Euros or tell him about this or tell him about that. And there's no point doing that. Oh, thank you. I'm not going to do that. Oh, thank you. Yeah. A few nations that have had unexpected success in the Euros does not compare to my mind with the amazing story that is Lester City. Just because I brought up that Lester City story, I'm not going to bring up every underdog story that happens in sport on the podcast because Gray will probably stop being my friend. Yeah. Very likely. Imagine I have just as much peace for this stuff as your wife would. Some, some, but not an infinite well. Okay. So all the sport I've been watching lately and the media coverage lately has brought up two things. There's two things I've noticed that get my goat that annoy me. Okay. So I thought I'd bring them up. One is when commentators and pundits and people telling the story of sport talk about getting revenge or banishing memories. And I think there's a real inequality in it that shows how much they live in the moment. Let me give you an example. Play two teams play in the World Cup final. Say Liberia plays China in the World Cup final. Okay. Right. And Liberia win. The next time those two countries meet and it could be in a lesser tournament and it could be like in the quarter finals. And this time China win. Commentators always say they got their revenge. They banish the memories of that World Cup loss and they finally got their revenge on Liberia by beating them. That is not revenge. The only way you can get like total revenge for a sporting loss is to have an equivalent game like another World Cup final. And this time win. That's the only way you can erase the memory or get them back or square the ledger. But because sports people always want to hype up the current game, they'll always say this game is a chance to get revenge for that previous game. It is not revenge if it is not the same tournament at the same level. Beating someone in a quarter final four years after you lost in the final. That's not revenge. And noise me. I thought you were going to say the only way for China to get revenge in this scenario would be to take over an annex Liberia. Let me tell you what revenge is. It is wiping Liberia off the face of the earth. Does taking turns winning a game you're playing with each other? Is there any way that that can even remotely count as revenge? No, it cannot. No, no. That would be going the other way. I think the whole premise of even revenge in a sporting event doesn't make any sense. Even if the games are equivalent, it still doesn't make any sense at all. It's like you're playing a game with each other and someone won and then someone else won, as will inevitably happen. Revenge is something that you plot stealthily for for years and like you spring upon your opponent when they have no idea what's going to happen, as opposed to a thing that takes place within a rigid and ordered system that has rules that we all agree on. I don't think the concept of revenge makes any sense in this whole arena. Well, okay. Maybe you don't like the word revenge. But there's this whole thing about squaring the ledger. Getting them back for the defeat and say, you defeat us in this game. Now we defeated you. Everything's even. I say everything is not even if the game is not of the same importance. But commentators don't seem to realize that. They want to hype up the game they're talking about. No, I'm sure they totally do realize it, but they're doing what you're saying. They're just trying to hype it up. It's just like the news, Brady, right? They know a lot of the stuff that they're talking about is dumb and won't matter in a week, but they want to hype it up so that it feels like it's really important right now. Maybe without analogy. Yeah, there's a bit of that. Moving right along. And the other thing that's really getting my nerves at the moment, especially in the world of sport, but I know it pervades all media, is this thing everyone does where they use three words and they punctuate it. There's a lot of sport in my Twitter feed and say someone scores a goal in a game of sports ball. There will be this tweet from some supposedly reputable organisation, usually the BBC. Suddenly writing like some teen vlogger and they will say what a goal, all capitalised, which I hate because that's like the internet equivalent of shouting. And there will be a full stop after every word. What? Full stop. A full stop. Go. Oh man, that annoys me. It annoys me. Apparently there are forums and things dedicated to people who hate this, but this is really getting me at the moment. Are you familiar with this? It's becoming good with a memey thing to do, isn't it? To sort of have these three punctuated words to add emphasis. Yeah, this is just people trying to communicate on the internet with the limited bandwidth that you have for Twitter. I have not seen this in particular. Maybe this is a sporting thing that will eventually bleed over into my internet as well. It happens in politics as well a bit, I think. Yeah. Sports and politics, the two things I follow so closely. So no, I have not seen these on my Twitter timeline. When this episode comes out, I'm going to tweet brand full stop, new full stop episode. Perfect. Hashtag, hello, internet. Right. And you know what? Let's see if just like clickbaiting headlines, we get tremendous traffic from that tweet, right? We tweet it all over the place. People will go nuts for it, right? That's probably why people are doing this, so people like it. All right, everyone. Go ahead, send me your three word tweets. And I'll block you. I'll tell you what, what are we going to keep clashing on here, grow? You're going to let me keep going? As always, I feel like the first half, three quarters, 80% of the show is always somehow like out of my control. Yeah. And then I let you drone on for 20 minutes at the end while I have a little nap. Exactly. You're like, I'm going to let me go on. It's like, no, Brady's just throwing out topics. Let's do that. Let's do that. Okay, go with this. Maybe we'll cut that. Maybe we won't. Who knows, right? You stop with these little moments. You're like, oh, can I try this? It's like, whatever, man, I know at this stage, you're just going to go with it. So what do you want to do next in our classic episodes? What do you think is going to happen next? Well, you know what the most requested corner is of all. Even you must know this. Plane crash corner. You said it. All right, is there a plane crash that you want to talk about? I do want to talk about a plane crash. But first of all, I want to tell you that I flew for the first time. By the way, I haven't said, but I'm in San Francisco at the moment and you're back in England. It's like we're alternating between episodes. We essentially passed each other like ships in the night, one going to and one coming from California. So yeah, we are. We did. We are now in opposite positions, again, recording with, of course, California's fantastic time zone shift, which makes everything super convenient. But I flew in the, and I think it must have been the first time I flown in one in the 787 Boeing 787, the Dreamliner. Oh. Oh, the Tesla of the skies, maybe. Maybe. And maybe I'm overstating the case a bit there, but it is super high tech. I don't know if you've been on one, but the thing that blew my mind was the windows in this plane. Are you familiar with the windows in the Dreamliner? I've heard of this plane. I have never been in one. I've never really looked it up. I'm just pulling up some pictures now, but what's up with the windows? Because from the outside, at least, they look like normal windows. Yeah, they're a little bit bigger than normal, but also they have in them this electric gel. So there's no shutter that you pull up and down. There's just buttons underneath and you press buttons and it tints the window to different levels depending on your setting. And also it puts this strange hue in the window. So if you're flying in the middle of the day, I happen to fly in the middle of the day from England to California, which can be quite disorienting and not that good for your body. But it casts this bluey hue across the windows for most of the flight. So it looked like night outside. The sun looked like the moon and all the landscape had this bluey look to it like it was nighttime. And it felt like it was night. It was amazing. So you could still look out the window and see the terrain below. But you felt like you were looking over the US at night. And then if you went and found a window that didn't have this on, it was like broad daylight. So it was really cool. It was a really nice gimmick. We could individual people turn on and off the blue effect. Is that something that was under your control as the window seat person? I'm not entirely sure, but the impression I had was you could control it yourself at certain times and at other times I think they took control of it so that you couldn't have one idiot streaming the cabin with bright light while everyone else was trying to sleep. On my flight to America I was the one idiot who had the window open. I didn't realize until the flight attendant came over and gave me a harsh talking to. It's like, oh sir, everybody else in this cabin is asleep. Why, I should close your window. I'm sorry. I'm trying to do work. Anyway, that's not my playing crash. Thank goodness because I was on that plane. Right, right. But let me give you a playing crash corner. And this is something that made the news a little while ago now. And I didn't bring it up because we haven't done a podcast for so long and we talk about lots of other stuff. But this caught my attention because I also has told me something about myself, which I want to ask you about at the end. First of all, let me tell you the story. You like this because it's got an obscure pompous name. I want to tell you about Operation Thoniper. Thoniper? I'm sure my pronunciation is incorrect because this is an incongod of knowledge. And basically, to start from the beginning, there was a flight on January 1st in 1985. This is in flight 980. And this was a flight that was going from Paraguay to Miami and it was going to stop in a couple of other places on the way. This is in 1985. 1985. Okay. Don't trust me. Trust me, Gray. We'll get in there. All right. All right. Take my hand and leave me through this journey then. Hold my hand. It will all make sense at the end. Okay. This plane with 29 people on it, I think it was 19 passengers and 10 crew, which is quite a high ratio of crew to passengers, actually. And what is called a seafit crash. This is a controlled flight into terrain, which I think is a lovely way of saying it flew into a mountain. Okay. And it flew into this mountain called Mount Illamani in Bolivia. And it hit the mountain at a height of about 6,000 meters. And I think to this day, that's the highest ever seafit crash there's been. Okay. That's the highest a plane's ever been when it flew into a mountain. Everyone died. So this was obviously quite a hard spot to get to, but they did send investigators. And a little piece of side trivia here, the lead investigator they sent was a guy called Greg Feath or 5th. And anyone who watches Air Crash Investigation, my favorite TV show, will know this guy, because this is like the talking head that they bring in to talk about every plane crash. He's like the dialer quote, sort of guy. He's quite a well-known crash investigator because of that. He was called in. They went up the mountain. It was covered in snow. The debris was all over the place. It was like a huge crash site. Everything was smashed to smithereens. Basically they couldn't find anything particularly useful. And they left. 1985. They didn't find the flight recorders. Right? Okay. Way up this mountain. In 2006, some of the wreckage started revealing itself because snow was melting in this glaciers and rocks and stuff moving around. And some of the wreckage started revealing itself again. Now what happened was there were these two guys called Dan and Isaac. I think they're from Boston or Massachusetts somewhere. And they read about this. And they sound like my kind of guys because they're interested in plane crashes and they're interested in mountains. And they saw that the flight recorders had never been found. And they looked up other crashes where flight recorders haven't been found. And there's quite a few of them. Most of them are deep under water. But this one obviously isn't this one's on land. So this year, just recently, they decided to go on like an adventure holiday to this mountain to try and find the crash site and try and find the flight recorders from this 1985 crash. I can't believe you haven't combined your interests of mountains and plane crashing to do this exact same adventure. Do. That's why I'm talking about it. I can't believe I didn't think of it. So these dudes are legends. So they've gone to this mountain in Bolivia in a place that sounds like it's not without challenges of various sorts. And I've got a few people to help them. They've gone up this mountain. They found this crash site in all the rock and the crevasses and everything. And they've started finding bits of metal. And I think they've spent three or four days there. And on the final day, they've turned over a piece of metal, which turns out to be orange on the other side, which is the color of black boxes. Funnily enough, as everyone knows, black boxes are orange, of course. And it's got this cable off it saying CVR, cockpit voice recorder. And they find part of the flight recorder. And they find some magnetic tape as well, which is probably what was in the recorder and some other bits and pieces. And I doubt they're going to get much from it in because it happened in 1985, but they've brought this stuff back in the hope of maybe finding out more about what happened to this crash. But I just think it's amazing that these two dudes who are like, just dudes have said, man, let's go to where that crash happened up that mountain in Bolivia and see if we can find the flight recorder that will be investigated and they go there and they find it. That is great. I love it when people just do a thing and I still say the intersection of these interests. It's amazing to me that you have not considered doing this before. I think there is a market in going to famous plane crash sites. I know for a fact of one famous plane crash site, also in South America that people do do too as to. This is the one where the plane crash happened from the film Alive, where the people spent months and months with their wreckage in the mountains and they ended up eating the dead bodies of people who died in the crash to stay alive and then they got rescued all this time later. You're familiar with this crash, or? Yeah, I think that's other movie alive. It's so really famous and people do go on tourist trips to a site where that happened. But really? They do. Yeah, I was looking at the internet, looking at the prices. No, you're better. Because it's in the mountains as well. I love mountains. It's got everything. It's got mountains, it's got drama. It has everything. I think the dream one to go to for me would be Mount Aerobus in Antarctica, where a plane famously crashed because there you're going up a mountain, you've got a plane crash site and it's Antarctica. I don't know. I don't know if you can go there. So what's going to happen here, Brady? I mean, are you trying to tell me slowly and gently that you're going to incorporate a mountaineering stroke, plane crash, cornering tourist business? Is that what your next venture is going to be? Because that's what it sounds like. That's what you're working toward. I'm not working towards it. The thing I wanted to bring up, the reason I found this interesting was when I first heard about this, I had a bit of a reluctance to read about it because they had a blog and stuff like that. I think they went with the journalists, so there's obviously more stuff to come, but I was initially a little bit reluctant to read about it. This is a feeling I often have that I want to see if it's just me, whether other people have this, but I sometimes don't enjoy reading or watching about other people's cool adventures. Because I think, well, that's their cool adventure, and I'm not having that. So why do I want to watch them doing something awesome? I want to do something awesome. My wife doesn't understand this quite often. She now understands it because it's what I'm like. But for example, if there's a documentary like Michael Palin goes and does a great travel show through the Himalayas, she's like, oh, let's watch that. It'll be so inspirational and you'll see so much amazing stuff. I'm like, I don't want to go and watch Michael Palin have a cool adventure in the Himalayas. That's good for him. That's him having an awesome time. That's not me having an awesome time. So I really, very often don't like watching travel shows because I feel like I don't want to watch someone else doing something cool. I'd rather spend my time doing something cool myself. Is that weird? I'm not going to say it's weird because I'm talking to you. I think I can understand why you wouldn't want to do that. But I can say that it's abnormal. There's no way that that's not abnormal. Yeah, I guess because those TV shows are so popular. So obviously lots of people like what they do. Right. Exactly. Most people want to watch those kinds of things. They want to sit in the comfort of their own home and watch somebody else have an adventure. Isn't that exciting to see somebody else do this thing? Isn't it entertaining to see somebody else go on an adventure? I definitely don't. Unless it's something I can't do. Like go to the moon. Right. That is not my attitude. So when I first heard about this operation, Thoniper with Dan and Isaac, my first instinct was, well, I don't want to see that because they just have in the coolest adventure and I could have done that. And now I'm going to be thinking, why aren't I doing that? But this was just too cool that I had to look and these guys are clearly legends for doing this. So it's a cool story. They've got a blog, go and read about it. They've done a cool thing. Playing crash, mountains, live in the dream. If you did a TV adventure, like some TV station contacts you and they say, we're going to hook you up with traveling the world, amazing adventure thing and we're going to film it and we're going to make a documentary about it, right? After it was done and over, would you want to watch your own adventure on TV? Yeah. Okay. Okay. Watching that. Because that's like my holiday photos. Okay. Okay. So that's what it is. So you wouldn't feel like, I don't want to watch me having an adventure. I already had that adventure. I want to go on the next adventure. No. No, no, no, no, no. It's not that. I did a video when I went to Everest Basecamp where I boiled water all these different outitudes. A video of yours, I love, by the way. I'm going to put that in the show notes. I think there's something fantastic and beautiful about that video. It's one of my favorite things that you've ever done is that video. Thank you. That's really kind. And I don't watch my videos back very often. But that is one of my videos that maybe once every six months or I will watch again and enjoy just as watching it. But I don't think I would enjoy watching someone else do it. Well, maybe I would enjoy someone else doing that because I've been there. But I find it hard to watch other people having really amazing adventures. I'm happy for them. I don't want them to have a good time and have those adventures. I think it's brilliant. But it's just like watching it just frustrates me. I'm like, oh, that's something I should be doing. That looks awesome. So for clarity, say, it's not any kind of envy. You don't envy them their experience. You just feel like you should be having the adventure. I think I kind of do envy it, but I don't begrudge them it. I'm not upset that they're having it. I'm happy that they're having it. But I guess it only applies to things I could conceivably do. Like for example, I don't mind watching Andy Murray win Wimbledon lift the trophy. I'm not thinking, dammit, why are I winning Wimbledon? Because I get that I can't win Wimbledon. So I watched that. Right. I was trying to close in on what are the edges of this thing? And it's like fiction doesn't seem to be like you're fine with watching fiction because it's not real. And you don't feel like I should be saving Middle-Earth. I think that's how you feel about it. No, no. I don't know exactly what it means. That's why I bring it up. I don't completely understand it. Well, obviously it means that you must be having adventures all the time if this is the way you feel about it. No, of course. Yeah, I mean, I should, I'd love to have it. Obviously, I'm not. Most of the time I'm sitting around editing videos and eating donuts. But I find that not an enjoyable use of my time watching other people have nice holidays. And so the holidays, right? Because I wouldn't enjoy watching other people have nice holidays either. That sounds like terribly boring television. And also it's like a totally different kind of thing. Whereas I'll happily watch somebody have an adventure. I'll happily watch all of those survival shows where people slowly starve to death over the space of a month. Like, great. No. I'll turn that on for entertainment any day of the week. But someone having a holiday, no, that sounds terribly boring. I mean, I love a good documentary about someone like climbing a mountain, like proper mountaineering, like, you know, something happening on K2 and stuff like that. Wait, how is that different than watching a documentary? Because I can't do that. Okay. Because I can't do that. You can't climb K2. Definitely not. Okay. I don't have ever said before, but the summit on Netflix about people climbing K2 is the best mountain documentary I've ever watched. You should watch that, Gray. It's the best one. If I can only watch one, I should watch that one. If you only watch one mountain thing ever, watch the summit. Okay. It's on Netflix. It's really good. Watch it, man. Watch it. You watch it and we'll talk about it. Okay. All right. Note me. I've watched it three or four times. But I'm not watching Michael Paylon drinking tea and having a nice time with people as he walks through the Himalayas. One other thing it feels like we have to do in a classic, classic episode is, well, you call it the biweekly way in. Oh, this. This is what you want to do. It's more of a health corner. I don't want to do this, but it's not a classic episode. If we don't do, like, Gray's health corner where he smuggly tells me how awesome he is now and how I'm still super unfit. Is that how this works? Is that how this has ever worked? Where is that your own personal resentment? No. Yeah. Maybe it's like watching a documentary. I don't want to watch a documentary about how Gray's becoming really healthy. Yeah. Okay. I love this. You don't want to do it. Trying to make me look bad, but you're still going to bring it up as a corner. Okay. So sure. Sure. What do you want to talk about in the Hello Internet semi-random? Sometimes we talk about health if Brady's in the mood or we're doing a classic episode corner. So the thing I'm wondering, I guess, is you know, you reached your target weight and everything was good and you did a great job. Like, what have you done since? Have you, like, kept, like, the same regime or was your regime able to now change to keep a steady weight or did your weight go up? Like, since you kind of hit your target and everything was good, what's been your course of action since? I mean, it's interesting because I just came back from spending a month in America, right? Fatland. Fatland, USA. Population, Lord. Right? It's so difficult here, man. It's, you know, but like, everything, everything in America is incredibly delicious and so good. And all I can say is when I go to America, the thing I always think of now is, thank God, at least, I'm not in the South, which is like America's America, right? Everything is just amplified again with deliciousness. So I was like, okay, at least I'm just in California. I only have to deal with that level of how good all of the food is. Before you tell me about what's happened since you came back from America, I mean, I am in California and I'm in Berkeley, which is like, you know, trendy, healthy place too. But even here, it's difficult. I was in Safeway last night and I just fancied some cookies. So I went to the cookie section and I just wanted a few cookies and I went to this huge table where they sell all the cookies. I could not find a box of cookies that they were selling that had less than 30 cookies in it. It wasn't an option. I just like, I just want to buy like two or three of those cookies, but you couldn't, you could only buy these huge, huge, clear boxes full of cookies. And then I went, there is this pizza place right near where I'm staying called the cheese board, which is really famous. It does really nice pizza. And I went there the other night and I was lining up in the queue because there's always a huge queue for the pizza, but it was nearly closing time. And when I got to order my pizza, I did the discipline thing and I ordered only half a pizza because they always throw you a few extra pizzas beyond what you order anyway. It's like a tradition. Okay, that's interesting. Oh, they always do it. So I knew I was going to get half a pizza plus two or three slices. So I said, can I have half a pizza place? And because it was near closing time and they still had lots of pizzas because they only make one flavor pizza and they just churn them out. That's just what you have to have that day. So when I ordered half a pizza, they said, no problems. Gave me a whole pizza in the box, gave it to me. And then just as I was about to walk away, he winked at me and said, I'll buy the way. And he gave me a second whole pizza. And so here's another one for it. I tried to do the right thing and order half a pizza and I walked away with two pizzas. And I'm on my own. I was just a lonely guy walking back to my Airbnb with two whole pizzas. People just shaking their heads. Look at me. Look at that dude. Look at that dude. Two pizzas, buddy. You should not be eating two pizzas, my friend. That's when you need to buy several drinks, like a six pack of soda, just so it looks like you're bringing supplies to your party instead of just like, oh, here's me with my two pizzas and my one diet coke. So it's really clear that I intend to eat all of this by myself. Right, you need camouflage drinks to cover that. Yeah. Just holding your phone to your ear even though you're not using it saying, yeah, yeah, I'll be there in a minute, guys. Yeah. Right. Keep the party going. Oh, God. So anyway, you're back from fat layer. Yeah, but I'm laughing as well because that's my experience to California. I mean, like nobody handed me two pizzas with a wink and a smile. But I did have this feeling that like, oh, it's going to be way easier in California, at least to eat healthier because there are a bunch of hippies. But it's like, you know what? It's still so hard. And even the healthy stuff comes in enormous portions. And when you're surrounded by everything else, like, do I really want to go to like granola barn or do I want to go to I hop? It's like, I want to go to I hop. That's what I wanted to do. It's just so hard. Okay. So the interesting thing here is we sort of touched upon a while ago that I had been changing some of my morning routines with like pret and getting coffee in the mornings and doing a bunch of stuff. And over time, I eventually kind of stumbled upon the realization that breakfast is an optional meal if you're mentally prepared for that. Which is an interesting thing to kind of realize in my life that all of my life, I have always thought, oh, if I don't have breakfast, things will be just absolutely terrible. But over the past several months, I have slowly learned that breakfast is optional. As long as I'm psychologically prepared for that fact when I get up in the morning, that I know I'm going to skip breakfast. So don't even try it stomach. And we're going to eat later. We're going to eat it lunch. So this is a piece of information that I kind of discovered about myself over time. And one of the things that I decided when I was going to fatland USA was that I was going to intentionally skip breakfast in the morning for the entire time that I was there. Because I thought at the very least, this will be some kind of damage minimization process because I am a man who loves his breakfast. And America is a land that does breakfast really well. And so I thought, I'm just going to take this out as an option to try to reduce calorie intake. And much to my surprise, even though I wasn't super great about eating stuff in America, especially during conference time, when you keep meeting up with people and like everywhere you go, you're meeting someone for a meal and you're eating something or I just find what I'm like drained from talking with people all the time. Like I just really want to eat something to kind of pick up my energy. I was kind of crap with the food, but I think skipping breakfast really worked because Miracle of Miracles, I came back from America a single pound heavier after a month, which I felt like was a tremendous, tremendous victory. No. Great. You've cracked the nut, mate. I've got to give it to you. You've done it. Yeah. I mean, not to glow in your face or anything, but I'm still under 200 pounds. I'm 199 again. Like America just nudged me ever so slightly over 200 pounds. I am again, back under 199. So that's where we are for the biweekly, not biweekly at all. In living, you're living the fidgetron 5000, Drain. Except there's one thing, if we're ever going to bring back the occasional biweekly way and actually talking about health corner, which I have let go because as someone once told me, if you love a biweekly way and you have to let it go and if it comes back then it was meant to be, so I'm never going to push anything. But I will say the one place that I have consistently and frustratingly failed is with the running. I have still not been able to run a complete 5K without doing a significant portion of it actually walking. And it's weird because I haven't given up the running. I find that I've gone for stretches of not doing it. And so then I'm not in shape to do it and I kind of have to start over with the program. And so that is a place where I have definitely fallen down on it. So like just throwing it out there, but we could always do something with the running because I do feel like being on the public hook, it's helpful. And you seem to be much better at the running than I am. I did bring my running gear with me and I went for a run the other morning and I just started, I wanted to get to the bay, to the coast from where I'm staying, which is a bit of a run. So I was running and running and ended up being further than I expected and took me longer than I expected to get there. So eventually I got to the waterfront and thought, oh this is nice. But I'd gone so far. I was like, oh now I'm really, really far from home. So I got an Uber home. That's fair. That's totally fair. It does feel a little bit sad when you're in your running gear and you're getting an Uber back to where you started. But I did a fair run. I have to say, like even when I'm unfit and I am unfit, I am able to still be able to still run. It does remind me of something, I think this is the nicest thing anyone has ever said to me and this is something my wife said to me. When we were in Bhutan, we did a couple of like long walks up mountains and stuff and my wife's a really fit person. Like she goes to the gym all the time and she's in great shape and we were climbing up these mountains and sometimes I was doing it like as strong as her. Sometimes I'll be walking in front of her and I'm not fit. And like I wouldn't be drinking water and I just soldier on up the hill even though I'm struggling. I just keep going. And she did say to me at one point, you just have so much grit, like you shouldn't be able to do this but you're just so stubborn that you just keep going. Like I guess it's the hardest nails thing. I was going to say, did she turn to you and say you're horrid as nails? No, she would never say that. But I liked the word grit. She knows I'm not fit but I've just have like this stubbornness that even though my body shouldn't be able to do it. I'm just like, well I'm not stopping. That's for whips. So running's never really a problem. But you're right, maybe running is the key for me and for you as well. Maybe we'll come up with some kind of rivalry. Maybe we'll have a race one day. Maybe this is the thing that we can revisit. I'm not going to pressure anything. I will never mention it. I will, you know, I'm just letting it go. There you go. There you go. We've done a biweekly way in health to sometimes occasionally corner. So I think we've ticked most of the boxes for a classic episode. I think we have as well. Are you happy Brady? Yeah.

I kind of don't want to hire there, but I think we kind of have to. There's been so much happening in the world of elections and politics and stuff. But the big one, and I'm getting asked about it all the time since arriving in America, is the UK Brexit vote, the referendum about whether or not the UK was going to stay in the European Union or leave the European Union. You were out of the country for this, weren't you? Yeah, I was out of the country. I was at VidCon when the vote actually happened. When the results came in again because of the confusing timeline, it was late in LA. And suddenly I started getting messages from people and realizing, oh, right, everybody is waking up in the UK right now to votes having been counted. So that's where I was when it occurred. And if you're listening on the planet Mars and don't realize the UK voted, I think it was 52% voted to leave the European Union. Yeah, it was 52 to 48 to leave the European Union quite a high turnout. It was in the 70s, I think, percentage turnout. So quite a strong turnout. Yeah, I saw some comparisons. It was like the highest voter turnout in decades for anything. Not only is just like the number of voters high, but it's the percentage of the possible electorate was also unusually high for the election. So tons of people turned out. So there you go. Supposedly, the UK is now going to leave the European Union. Yeah, I mean, this is so many people want us to talk about it. But it's one of those things as well. Like I haven't been following the details super closely. Like when it was first announced and when I was in LA, I did kind of follow the news for a while. But it was, it was mainly because I was supposed to be at some party and I was being a cramudge and I'm like, this party is really loud. I don't want to be here. It's hard to talk to people. And then suddenly when news starts rolling in, it's like, wow, news seems like a much more attractive option. So I just like left and sat down on Twitter for a while trying to read through news stories and see what's going on with Brexit. Like as the results were actually coming in because at first it was, it looks like this is the way it's going to happen. And then it really did become official. So I kind of followed it right at the start. And then I have only heard some of the major beats of this that have occurred in the past two weeks. But as you might expect with the thing, like I haven't been following it super, super close every day. I mean, since it happened, the British politics has just like exploded. Like it's been crazy. But I don't think that's particularly what most people would like to hear about because that's probably of more interest to British people. But it's like, it has been like House of Card since because obviously the Prime Minister resigned. And then there's been all sorts of Machiavellian machinations going on and like stuff you couldn't make up and everyone's resigning and stabbing everyone in the back. And you couldn't make it up. But I guess that's kind of the fallout. The result itself, I mean, we surprised, we pleased. Is it what you expected? Are you disappointed? Do you have any feelings about what happened? I mean, well, if you go back and listen to our episode where we talk about this before it occurred, I feel like I'm probably have a lot of the same feelings. Like I made it pretty clear in that episode that my position is that it would be better for the UK to stay in. And that was your position as well. And also the thing that it talked about at that time was it's a very hard thing to discuss in any meaningful way. And part of the reason that I haven't followed the politics super closely this time around is because I feel it's the same thing again. Like when I look into what's going on with Brexit, it's like, okay, we did this vote. People voted. There is a clear outcome from the vote. Like that is not in any amount of uncertainty. But what happens next? It seems like it's the same problem again. Who knows? Like there's no details. There's no procedure. There's no plan. There's no prime minister to enact anything. I know the people who fought for it have all left the ship. It's like people set fire to the house and then walked away. Yeah. What you're describing there is it's like the leader of UKIP resigned and there's been a whole bunch of other things about like people who were prominent Brexit cheerleaders who kind of want nothing to do with it after it actually happens. Which I don't think is any kind of like real surprise in some ways. But it does mean that at the time of recording we are in this position where it is just a total shrugging shoulders, hands up in the air emoji about what is actually going to occur. What's going to happen? It is unknown. What do you think? What do you think? Well, obviously I have trepidation about speaking about politics in a public forum because people feel so strongly about it. Most people are pretty entrenched in their positions. And you could say I'm entrenched in my position. So like it's not like you're going to persuade anyone of anything. You're either just going to have people agree with you or get angry at you. It's not really a discussion. But I'll talk about it. People who follow me on Twitter probably know what I think about it. Because after we spoke about it on the podcast, probably in the last week or two before the vote itself, I've started to feel more strongly about it. And I really hoped that we would stay as part of Europe. And I started following the debate a lot more closely. And a lot of things happened in the last week or two before the vote, which we don't need to go into all the details. But I hoped we would stay. Now all the people I'm friends with think the same as me on Facebook and a lot of my Twitter feed and all that. So I was surrounded by a lot of reinforcing comments where everyone was saying we have to stay. We're going to stay. It's all great. Look at my Facebook feed. It would be inconceivable to you that the vote would go the way it did. Yeah. And this is a total phenomenon that everybody experiences politically is. It doesn't matter what election for what event, just the way people naturally sort themselves. You are almost certainly going to find yourself in a situation where the vast majority of people you know and or follow online agree with you. And so result seems surprising. But I was not totally surprised. I was a little bit surprised, but not totally surprised because luckily for me, I have a diverse and a range of friends that I have a few friends from different parts of England to me who felt the opposite. And I would occasionally see posts from them and I'd be like, really? You really think that? And I would sometimes go clicking off down those rabbit holes into their worlds of friends. And suddenly I was seeing whole different feeds and whole different worlds where it was overwhelmingly the other way. And my way of thinking wasn't represented at all. So it was kind of a wake up call for me that hang on a second. This may well go the other way. And of course it did go the other way. And I'm really disappointed by it. And I feel a bit like a parent. It's almost like I'm not angry and just disappointed. But I am also a little bit angry about it. But I kind of feel a bit helpless about it. And I have cooled down quite a lot since the week or two after the debate. But I just think it was such a wrong-headed decision by so many people. And it's almost like I feel a bit cringy that I'm surrounded by so many people that think in a certain way that I don't think. And I respect their right. And they won the vote. So good for them. Although, funnily enough, all those people who I'm friends with who were like, let's leave, let's leave, have gone very quiet. Because I think I do think it's true that a lot of them perhaps didn't think they'd win. Or it would be different. And I think a lot of people are a bit shocked. And I've spoken to some of them. I've got a few relatives, actually. Young relatives who I spoke to and I said, after it says, you voted to leave, did you like why? And they're kind of like, I don't know. I kind of regret it now. I am saying a lot of that. And there is this sort of pervasive media story that's coming across that everyone regrets their vote. I don't actually think that's true. I think it's probably more all the people like me kind of still in our bubbles telling ourselves that everyone regrets how they voted. Yeah, I probably don't. Yeah, I completely agree. I've seen a few of those stories and I think that they are frankly, horrifically unfair anecdotal evidence. Yes, I agree. And also, wishful thinking almost certainly on the part of the people reporting them. Yes, I think there was a lot of wishful thinking going on in the fall out from the people who lost. And, you know, then they lost. But what's going to happen now kind of baffles me? I mean, as I've said before, I think personally, it's probably not that bad for me. I do a lot of my work in America. So sort of the plunging pound and the pound has immediately plunged. Yeah. And the economy has immediately started tanking. Like everyone said that wouldn't happen and it was scaremongering. Like everyone thought these countless professionals that were saying would be really bad for the economy, which is scaremongering and within sort of an hour. Yeah. The economy plunged. But you know, that's not terrible for me. I hope I actually think the people who are going to be hurt the most are probably a lot of the people who voted to leave funnily enough. But you know, the world will keep turning and everything will work out. I don't think leaving the European Union is going to look like what the people who want to leave the European Union thinks it will look like. Basically, I think we will leave the European Union. But all of the concessions and compromises and things that have to be done are going to result in a situation where everyone is unhappy. Because we have to stay in the common market and then they're not going to let us stay in the common market of Europe without the free movement of people. And it's the free movement of people that I think a lot of the leaders were against. But the free movement of people wasn't part of the referendum question. The referendum question was just should we leave the European Union. So I think we're going to leave this governmental body. But all of the compromises that are going to be necessary to preserve the UK's economy are going to result in all the leave is being unhappy anyway. I don't know. I could be wrong. I have no idea now. I just kind of, I just got to go along for the ride. Yeah, it's interesting. I'm actually kind of okay talking about Brexit now because it does feel like this is a moment after all of the passions have passed. So this morning when I knew we were going to record the podcast and we were inevitably going to talk about this topic, I was sitting down and trying to prepare for it and thinking, like what are my thoughts on this? Like now that time has passed, let me try to think about this. And the only way that I could come up with, how do I want to think about this is to be a bookmaker on the odds of what is actually going to occur. There was no other way that I could kind of think about this in a sensible way. Would you have listed is one of what I see as like three options for what can occur? Would you have described where the UK leaves the European Union, but not like a technicality, but stays in something like the EA, like the European economic area or something similar like that. I think of that as the non-exit Brexit, which is we're braggsiting, but on a total technicality that the end result of what is going to happen is that the UK just gives up a bunch of rights. It keeps free movement of people. It keeps paying into the European Union. And like from a normal citizen on the street perspective, all seems the same. Like people who live in Europe can come move to the UK, people in the UK can go move to Europe. And as we discussed on the last podcast, like immigration was a huge issue. I give the non-exit Brexit in my mind a 55% chance of happening. I think that that is the majority likelihood that this is what's going to occur. And just as you were saying, when I was writing up my notes, this to me strikes me as the most pure of a compromise, right? Because in a compromise, everyone's unhappy in some manner, right? Like that's what a compromise is. And it's like, okay, great. The pro-European people are going to be unhappy because now the UK has no say in how the European Union is governed has absolutely no levers to pull to try to institute any reforms in the European Union. And then the people who wanted to Brexit, they are going to be unhappy because this situation almost certainly addresses literally nothing that they cared about in their voting, right? But these trying to imagine and looking at the things that Brexiters were complaining about is like this addresses nothing. So I really think that that's like the 55% chance, non-exit Brexit is the thing that occurs. Everybody is unhappy to some extent. But it means that a lot of the economic concerns that we currently see happening with businesses and with the strength of the pound and investment and construction and all of this stuff in the UK. And that stuff doesn't care. Like it'll just keep trucking along as per normal with the non-exit Brexit. And it allows some of the pro-Brix at people, whether they're leaders or voters, to sort of save a bit of face. That's exactly it. It's a face-saving maneuver. Perhaps it is the worst, most self-harmoned, flicking, face-saving maneuver that has ever occurred. But it allows them to say we have achieved victory in exiting the European Union. What have you accomplished? Oh, we gave a ball of our voting rights in the EU and nothing else. That's not a good thing. It's terrible. There's one group that will claim that as a victory, and they're the people who talk about sovereignty. And I could have a lot to say about those people, but anyway, I won't. And they will say yes, but we're now the masters of our own destiny. And not only is that like a little bit deluded. Yeah. But it was really beautifully put by an article that Ben Goldacre wrote right before the vote saying that a lot of these terms that we used in the campaigning like let's be masters of our own destiny are hollow meaning the statements that you see on the cover of self-help books at airports. And what does that even mean? Now we control our own destiny. What? Like, let's take control. Like what? Believe in yourself, Britain. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. It's like there are a small number of people that if we go down this path, we'll claim yes, but now we're in control of our own destiny. Well, no, you're not. And in fact, you're probably less in control because you're still at the whims of market forces like everyone in the world, except now there's one less lever you have access to. Exactly. You know, you repay in labor. So it's a totally 1984 style. Less say is more control, right? That's what that result ends up practically being. The other kind of marking it out thing is I put that my next most probable event is at 35%. I think that literally nothing changes. That the government takes the hard line short term option of just totally ignoring the non-binding referendum of saying we're just not going to do this. And I think that option has some really, really terrible consequences. But I don't see it as an impossibility. I mean, to be clear here, I go just to get this on record. Like, while I am on the side that lost in this argument, there is no doubt that there was huge voter turnout and people voted to leave. And simply choosing to do something like ignore the referendum, like even though it was non-binding, it was not sold to people as non-binding. You're not going to be able to stand up and explain that this thing had the legal power of an opinion poll and get a happy result from people who were like, oh, okay, well, then, you know, whatever, no harm, no foul on this one. Unless it's true that everyone regrets their vote, which I don't think it is. But if that was true, everyone might just quietly put their tail between their legs and let's just pretend that never happened. There are a few cases in recent years across a whole bunch of European countries where they have had votes of the people in relation to things to do with Europe, where the will of the people has then subsequently been ignored or circumvented. Like, it's becoming an increasingly long list, but nothing quite so dramatic as a vote to leave the union altogether. And I think you're right. Ignoring it would be a big deal. But for people who don't know, to leave the European Union, a vote has to be conducted by the parliament, all the MPs in the parliament, the majority of whom don't want to leave the European Union are required to put up their hand or vote through the right lobby to say, yes, we're going to leave. So they're going to have to vote against their own will and follow the will of this referendum. And finally enough, the referendum was all about protecting the sovereignty of the UK parliament. So all of a sudden, the parliament, which we fought so hard to protect the sovereignty of, where our representatives are there deciding the future of the country, are then going to have to vote against what they want to vote. Because of a huge poll, it's an interesting dilemma. But it would be a very hard case for any MP to say, well, I didn't vote for it even though there was this result of this referendum. So it's a real, it's a real pickle. Yeah, but it's not even like, oh, it's just a real pickle. There's no way that the parliament just ignoring the referendum is anything other than anti-democratic. There's no way that that's not true. The people voted to leave. And then if parliament says, ah, forget it, we're just going to ignore this. But the people also voted all of those MPs to represent them in the parliament. The people democratically elected them to do that. Right. And that's actually where the true sovereignty of the UK lies in the parliament and in the MPs who were elected by the people. So they also have a democratic job to do to vote for things on behalf of their constituency. And I mean, we haven't got demographics for each constituency. So we don't know, they don't know what their particular people want necessarily. So there is a clash between the two forms of democracy here. And I know it's sort of, you know, splitting hairs and it's the way for the losers to get out. But it is also really legitimate concern about how this form of democracy works. Well, it is an interesting question about the nature of representative democracy. Let's assume that the majority of MPs do not think it is a good idea for their constituents if the United Kingdom leaves the European Union. It's just used it as a starting point for a conversation. Yeah. But at the same time, you have direct democracy where the people themselves have voted to leave. What is the correct decision for a moral member of parliament if they disagree with the democracy? What to do? I think there's no good way out of that. There would have been a good way out of it. I don't know if there's a possible I imagine is that what the parliament could have done was passed a law that the result of the referendum was binding before the referendum happened. But they didn't do that. And I almost think they deliberately didn't do that. This is kind of my theory about why do I think there's a 35% chance that literally nothing happens or a 55% chance of a non-exit Brexit, which leaves like an 85% chance that essentially from the average citizens perspective, nothing changes. Is that was at 90%. I don't know if I'm adding these numbers up right now. I have a feel for the proposal. That's exactly it. Listen, these numbers, they're number-ish. Maybe I mean a 45% non-exit Brexit, but whatever, 80% chance nothing happens. Just like when I try to think about the future and I'm thinking about how soon our electric car is going to come or something else that's on the horizon, how soon is genetic manipulation technology? When I try to think about what changes in the world, I think you always have to try to look at it from the perspective of things like economic demand, which I always place a lot of value on, and you have to look at the trend lines of where things are going to occur. And you also have to look at what does the current institution in power think of this and how much power do they have to accelerate or prevent this thing? And I look at the whole Brexit situation, and I can't help but think that. And one, I think that a lot of the stuff that occurred in that election was politicians probably pandering to the leave voters for their votes, partly because of the way that the UK government kind of does the first pass the post-votes splitting thing. I think a lot of the kind of prominent people who make a career on being anti-the European Union. There are a lot of people who might quite enjoy the position of being against a thing, and so of course they want the thing to continue to exist, and in their heart of hearts might recognize that it's actually better, but there's like a political niche of being the opposition. And so for example, I think with newspapers and stuff, or even with the UK government in particular, they always love to blame the EU for everything, because it means there's always someone to pass the buck onto. Right? Oh, it's never actually our fault. It's always somebody else's fault. You had a political level, there's that, and at a personal level there's blaming immigrants or people from other countries for your problems. I think that happens at a few levels. At one level you blame the bureaucrats. There's one group of people who just hate those bureaucrats in Brussels. And then there's another group of people that want to blame immigrants because they're not happy with their lot in life, and they think maybe people are taking their jobs or they're changing their culture for the worse. So there's a few different levels going on there. Yeah, there's definitely a few different levels. So what I want to be clear here is I don't think that the people who voted for Brexit were insincere, but I can say that I doubt the suspicions of a lot of the political leaders who were promoting Brexit. Like, I doubt in their heart of hearts like what did they actually really want? And what I think that they might have wanted was a close loss, right? But so that they can say, oh, you know, we fight for you, Brexit EU skeptics, we fight for you like vote for us. I think that that's their ideal outcome. And then when you add on top of that, what I think of as looking at the economic situation and we now have definite evidence that like the global market and the local economy does not like Brexit, right? This is thumbs down on Brexit, at least in the short run for what does the world economy think about this situation? And so I look at it and I say, okay, one, the people who are in power, who are in the position to actually change things, I think most of them don't want anything to change. And secondly, I think there's huge economic pressure to not change. So when I look at those two things, that's why I only put like a 10, 15% chance on Brexit in the way people who voted for Brexit think of it actually occurring. The complete withdrawal. Yeah, it would have won. Exactly, yeah, right? I think there's very little chance of that happening because the people holding the levers of power don't want it to occur. Kind of like the embodied corporations out there don't want it to occur. Like what I imagine is happening right now as we're talking is that maybe somewhere, somewhere in the government, there is a room in which politicians and prominent politicians and party backers and companies and banks are all in a room leaning a tremendous amount of pressure on some poor sod to be the scapegoat for this whole thing. We just want someone to take the fall for why Brexit isn't going to occur because all of the interests in this room don't want it to occur. Who can that be, Gray? But who can, how does that manifest itself? Well, I'm not a details man. I'm just an idea guy, right? I don't know what that looks like. It could only be like a prime minister that refuses to do it, but then they'll have to fall on their sword and then the pressure will be on the next prime minister to do it. Which is kind of what's happened. Also, there's the possibility of having an early election in the UK, which is more difficult to do, but it's still possible to do. I just think that the various powers that do not want this to occur and in a situation like this, if I have to put my money down on who is going to win this fight, the powers that I speculate do not want this to occur or the people who voted in a referendum who, again, to be clear, democratically won that it should occur. I don't put my money on the people in that scenario. I put my money on the establishment in that scenario, getting what it wants. What does super rational, Gray, think about that? Do you think that's good? Do you think that's wrong? Because at a base level, it feels wrong, doesn't it? The people, democracy, the will of the people should be. Like a super rational dude like you might think, actually, that's probably a good outcome that the people, the people don't always know what's best for them. Yeah, so I can, like this morning is the first morning I actually gave some serious thought to this. And my conclusion is that it is wrong. It is wrong for the government in this scenario to ignore the will of the people. I don't think there is any argument against that. But I am on the other side. I don't think Brexit is a good idea. And so this is a case where a thing might occur for the wrong reasons that in the long run is better, but that still doesn't really justify the like, oh, democracy. We're just going to throw it out the window right now. So the way I look at this is there are no good directions to take. I think in the long run, it's probably better for the UK to stay part of the EU. But to do that requires the government to kind of subvert its own process. And it's like, well, all we have is the process though. Like if you start walking down this road of, oh, Loss, like, you know, we use them when we like them, but we don't use them when we don't. It's like, but what's happened now? Like this is all we have to keep the world together. I mean, the legitimate way around that I guess it sounds stupid even saying it would be like a revote, like a, are you sure? Vote. Like, and then see if the same result. I know how crazy that sounds, but that would not subvert the process at least. It would be like, it could be, we want a bit more clarification and the questions could be a bit more detailed this time. And that could be used as a mechanism to withdraw the decision. If the people want to withdraw the decision, which maybe they don't, legally and technically that would possibly be one of the cleanest solutions that, like you said before, the UK says, look, we're going to have another referendum. And this one is immediately legally binding. Well, they say we're going to, we're going to keep having referendums until you've like, but that's, but that's exactly the problem though. But I like you suspect that the original referendum was written to be non-binding. And again, all of the parties, including you, Kip and the conservatives, agreed on the fact that it wasn't non-binding, which leads suspicions to me like, well, they don't want it to go the wrong way. And so that, that to me just says, well, maybe you can have another one that's legally binding, but it's just, there's no way it doesn't look awful to do that. And I was like, no, we're just going to keep voting until we get what we want. It's like, well, that's a terrible democracy. It's a terrible way to do things. I just find it very interesting that there is no good outcome. I don't know. I think it almost feels like Bayesian statistics about this to me, which is as you add additional pieces of information about a problem like it, certain unlikely probabilities seem more likely. And the reason I bring that up is because when I think about Brexit occurring, like if the UK actually leaves, I think it is very likely, like 97% likely that Scotland leaves the UK if that occurs. I find it very hard to imagine that that does not occur. Because for people who don't know who haven't been following the story, the Scottish people overwhelmingly voted to stay in the European Union. But of course, they're just part of the whole conglomerate of the UK. And all their votes were locked in with the overwhelming majority of English people and Welsh people. So if you were just taking the votes cast in Scotland alone, they did want to stay. And obviously the Scottish independence people are using that as leverage and saying, well, hang on, we don't want to leave the European Union the rest of you do. If we were independent, we wouldn't be dragged under with you. So they're going to use that to trigger there and another independence of our business. And at least from my reading of it, there was something about how the Scottish Parliament was even saying, as far as they're concerned, they've already voted to stay. So they just will stay, right? If the UK actually leaves, like we don't even need to hold another referendum. We as a nation already had a huge margin that says we're going to stay. So then they're going to definitely get their own approach. And then they will, because they'll be top level sovereignty, right? It's very clear. That could be the deciding factor. Scotland, you have your own emoji, right? Then Scotland's going to be wishing that the UK leaves, they can get their emoji. That's how people make decisions in these things. But so when I think about that, I really do think that it's almost impossible to imagine a scenario where Scotland doesn't leave the UK if the UK leaves the EU. And then if that occurs, I also think it starts getting into the realm of like, not crazy unlikely that Northern Ireland, which also voted to stay, might leave the UK. Because then like Northern Ireland would be making a decision in the perspective of, do you want to leave the European Union with England and Wales alone? Right? Like that's a very different question, all of a sudden. Then we're really looking at Brexit might lead to the breakup of the United Kingdom, which I think is a thing that's kind of on people's minds now as a possibility that might occur. And so when I say it's like, it's like Bayesian in a way, it's almost like if the UK were to have another referendum, that piece of information plus the piece of information that the international markets obviously don't like the idea of Brexit, I think that really changes the idea of what are you voting for. Possibly just Wales and England to leave the EU. That sounds like a terrible idea. Like I don't think very many people would vote for that if it was on the referendum, but it may very well be the logical consequence of the referendum. Yeah, I think you're right, Gray. There's a few other things that I feel the thoughts that I had. One thing that I think is important to say, because it's a really important thing in what's going on in politics in a few things, is that I don't think most of the people who voted to leave are idiots. Right. Like I think they made a poor decision for whatever reasons they made it, but I don't think they're idiots. But I think that has been the pervasive message. If you vote to leave, you're an idiot. And that was kind of the intellectual highbrow sort of attitude that was coming across and the build up to the election. And I think that was really, really counterproductive. And I think it makes people who are 50-50, but leaning or maybe people who have a slight leaning towards leave. I just think it entranches their position. Telling people their idiots is bad. And I think it became a really big part of this election. That people who maybe have a lower income or come from a part of England that is poorer felt like they were being told they were idiots for having their doubts about Europe. And I think that caused a real backlash. And fair enough, too. You shouldn't tell people their idiots. I totally agree. I mean, this goes back to my whole feeling about how groups just talk with themselves and they end up creating these imaginary versions of the other group that they just rail against. How does that change anybody's mind? I think that just is the same thing. It further makes people feel resentful and trench into their positions. It's not a mind-changing thing to describe someone as an idiot. I mean, so you should change your mind and vote for me. It's not a good argument. It's not a good way to change someone's actual mind. Tell you what else I've done, Gray. What? I've started the process of applying for my Irish passport. Have you really? Yep. So I can say that you're paying unions, too. Are you able to get an Irish passport? I am. I am. So I've gotten Australian one and I've got a UK one, but I am eligible for an Irish one. So I could end up with three passports. I always forget that you have the UK passport. I don't know why I can't remember that. I was thinking like, oh, but buddy, if you get the Irish passport just like me, you can stay in the UK anyway. You don't have to go travel to the UK or be in union. But if I do want to keep the option of being able to live and work anywhere in the EU. I think it's a stupid thing and I don't really need to do it, but it was just something I did on impulse. But I'm not the lone ranger. The Irish authorities have actually issued a plea to the people that are Britain to stop applying for Irish passports because they're doing absolutely overwhelmed at the moment. Oh my God, I'm not surprised. I'm not the least bit surprised that Ireland must be getting swamped with passport applications. So there you go. I'm currently gathering all the necessary birth certificates and things like that. Well, I wish you all the best of luck in your Irish endeavors. It could be a long way by the sounds of it.",

      "episode": "H.I. #66 A Classic Episode.txt",
      "text": "So, Grey, looking through our projected notes here, I think potentially we have a classic Hello Internet episode, all the major food groups are represented here. Oh boy! Oh boy! Reading between the lines that means it's an episode you're going to dread. When I think of what Brady imagines to be a classic episode of Hello Internet, all I can think of is many, many Brady segments. Yeah, that pretty much sums it up. After my success last week for the second episode in a row, I'm going to try to open up with a listener message, a listener interaction, because you know I love them and I know you hate them. I know, but no, I'm not going to let you get away with that. I don't hate them. I only include them if they're interesting. All right. That's the difference. I, too, enjoy the interesting ones. That's why I leave them in. Okay. Well, let's see how this one feels. I went to what I sometimes refer to as the Hello Internet postbox the other day. Okay. Essentially, this is my postbox. So if there's something you want to send to Gray, do not send it to this postbox, because I will bin it. I will not give it to Gray, because I cannot set that precedent. You mean your PL box? That's what you're talking about. The one we used for the election. That's the Hello Internet postbox. Yes, exactly. Okay. So I went along. I went along for a check. Hoping there might be a few new postcards. There was a package. No. There were several packages, actually. Oh, my. That sounds like something I would hand over to the police. Well, yes. Anyway, I opened this package. It is a book. Now, for background, people might remember my thoughts on the book, Getting Things Done by David Allen. This is a book that Gray, I think, holds in quite high regard. And I did not enjoy this book so much. The extent where I got a refund on my audiobook, because I didn't want it. And my hard copy, we auctioned for charity. I wanted this book out of my life. This book was not for me. I will. I will put the show where we discussed it. One of my favorites in the show notes. Again, I think you misrepresent me here. I'm not exactly sure that it was an unambiguous hold in high regard on my part, but I will let the listeners decide if that was a fair characterization. Okay. Anyway, like a bad penny. That has sent me a copy of this book. It's got another copy. I'm thinking, ah, what's all this about? So I open it up. And on the inside cover, the front inside cover, whoever has sent this has inscribed a small flaggy flag. So immediately a loud bell start ringing. This is obviously a mischief maker, Rebel Scum. They're up to no good, obviously. And then on the next page, inserted between the pages is a beer coaster, like a beer mat with a web address on it. And I'm thinking, ah, no, what's going on here? This is dodgy. And it's an imgirl, im juror, however, I'm supposed to pronounce that address. So they want me to look at some photo. But then before I look at the photo, I turn the next page. I love how you keep going into this. Who knows what's coming, but Brady is going to find out, right? Okay. It's an adventure. Now on the next page, which is kind of like the title page, is an inscription. Okay. What does that say? It says, too, Brady Harin, give it another go. And I'm going to guess, is that like David Allen's signature on the body? It is David Allen's signature, because if you go to the imgirling, which I'm sending you now, we have someone who I don't know who this is, they're obviously a mischievous Tim, holding a copy of the book, standing with David Allen at a book signing. So he has obviously taken his book up to David Allen and asked him to sign it to me, asking me to give it another go. That is fantastic. A few things come into my mind when I see this. The first is, I have to say David Allen has gone up a few pegs in my standing. Oh, has he? Yeah. But secondly, how did that interaction work? What did he say to David Allen when he was asking him to sign the book and say, can you please say, you know, to Brady, give it another go? He must have had to explain, oh, there's this podcast and there's this guy and he really slagged off your book and he said it was really boring and he like got rid of his copies. So you should listen to the episode. It's really entertaining. He tries to put it in the show notes. Right. How do you think that unfolded that interaction? I mean, again, here is the thing, the way you imagine stuff Brady is that someone goes into all of the details. But I would suspect that this magnificent Tim was pulled this off would simply just say, oh, I have a friend who tried the book and didn't like it. Could you give them a suggestion to give it another try? I think that's the fastest way in a book signing line to get the basic just a bit across. I don't know, Greg. Maybe I'm reading too much into the picture, but if you zoom in on David Allen's face in that picture, I sent you. He doesn't look happy. He does look a little bit like he's been cornered into doing something he didn't want to do. Or am I just reading too much into that? Because on the cover, he looks all smarmy and tan and happy and Californian. And in this picture, he looks a bit like just get me out of here, man. Get me out of this photo. Looking at that picture, I can see why you think that. It also looks like maybe he is suppressing a bit of a smile. Like maybe he thinks this is some kind of funny situation. His expression is hard to read, but you're right. Maybe he just concorded and he wants to get out of there and someone has just told him an overly long, overly detailed story in order to get them to sign this book. I day like the Tim, magnificent Tim. I can't help but wonder. It must be a weird experience to do a book signing of a book where your own face is on the cover where everyone is constantly handing you a book with a picture of you smiling at you to then sign. If I was an author, I wouldn't want my face on the cover of the book. I would find that a weird situation signing books with my own face on it. I think if you've signed off on having your face on the cover, you're the sort of person who would probably quite enjoy signing a book with your face on the cover. You might have a point there. I might not be thinking this through all the way. This is an excellent, excellent listener interaction. I don't see any way that I can possibly cut this from the show, which makes you two for two in your gambling of openings here. All right. Very well done, Brady. And thank you, magnificent Tim, whoever you are. If you do hear this, tell us about this interaction with David Allen. We want to hear every detail, every nuance, every tick, every little bit of body language on a full briefing. Yes. Brady wants to hear that. All of that full briefing, it might not make it into the next show. You owe me $100, Brady. Well, after I made that bet with you, and for those who have forgotten, Gray went to VidCon, and I made a bet that he would get dragged up to do like a panel or talk or something like that. And he bet me $100 he wouldn't. And on the face of it, I thought that was a good bet. And very quickly after making it, I realized it was a mistake. And it wasn't a mistake for the reason that you think it's a mistake. It wasn't a mistake because Gray is like a recluse or shy or doesn't like attention. That those things are true. But Gray is also like, you do public things now. And you've started to do more of it. And also you are like a nice guy and someone who likes to please his friends and his colleagues. Okay. Interesting. No, I think it's true. You will help your friends if they ask you. I imagined a scenario where someone was going to say, you Gray come up and do this panel, I help us out with this Q&A because everyone loves Gray to be a nice surprise. And I thought, put in that situation, you would agree to it. The thing that I didn't take into account is how unlikely it was that would happen. Because people don't like giving up their stage. And what person doing a Q&A or a panel is going to want to give up their limelight to someone else. You know, these are like YouTube celebrities who love the limelight. So it suddenly occurred to me, hang on. Gray probably won't even get asked to do this. So he'll never have to refuse. So come on. Did you get asked? I went into acting with people essentially pre-shut down any discussion of joining any panels by always saying, I'm just here as a civilian, I'm just here as a tourist, I'm not doing anything. I'm just here as a normal guy, just a normal person with a VidCon pass. That's what I was trying to pitch myself to in every single interaction. And so remarkably, no, I did not get asked to do anything. But I also agree with you that my interesting experience of VidCon was over and over realizing like, oh, this is obviously where all of the extroverts go. These are all of the people who love to be on stage, who love to be in front of huge audiences. Like by definition, if you are a huge YouTube star, you are probably that kind of person. You're probably not a huge introvert. Like there are exceptions to that, but for the most case, that's the way it's going to work. And so you are definitely right that there may have been an element of who wants to invite an additional person up on their panel. Nobody. You do that. Everybody wants the panel to be as much about them as they can possibly have a be. So I mean, that's it. I was right. I mean, I was wrong, but I was right and why I was wrong. As soon as I made the bet, I realized my mistake was not graze introversion. It was everyone else's extraversion. It was their unwillingness to share the line. So I owe you $100. You owe me $100. And because of Brexit, which we may discuss later, I need to do a bit of horse trading about what the best way to give you that money will be as the pound plummet. I don't know how I'm going to do this, but I'll try and find a way to do it that won't bankrupt me. Right. $100 or $5,000. Right. You're a choice. So I lost the bet. So while I was at VidCon, we had just recorded that morning and we had had our big discussion about the Snapchat. How does it work? Our friend Destin of Smarter Every Day just kept pushing me to join Snapchat. That dude, that dude, right? He was like a Snapchat drug pusher. Every conversation. I think he must have stuck in the Snapchat. I honest to God. That was what I was thinking too. He was like, you are so pushing this. I'm just going to assume that you're a secret co-founder of Snapchat. Nothing else makes any sense here. It was one of those things where the more someone talked, the less and less I was convinced every second. We had had this whole conversation where you tried to explain it to me. Then I had Destin showing me all of the amazing things that you could do on Snapchat, including a moment which I totally loved where we were just having as you do, I hopped for dinner in America. Then whips out his phone and he's like, look, look at this thing that you can do. I can just film you and your hands eating your dinner. Isn't this great? This is going to go up on Snapchat immediately and people can look at it. I want nothing to do with the Snapchat. The more you're trying to convince me, the less convincing this absolutely is. He was super excited about that video. He asked me the other day if I want the original footage. I think he thinks it's the subruder film or the mood landing or something. He raised hands on the Snapchat. It was your Snapchat debut or something. Maybe there's something about that video I've missed, but I sort of watched it and thought it's just a dude filming another dude's hands eating food and the dude sounds unimpressed about being filmed. Yeah. The thing that I didn't even understand is it seems like Snapchat just like Twitter has a character limit. Snapchat has some kind of time limit for what it's recording. When he was trying to explain it to me, it just cuts off in the middle as I get great. You're totally selling this thing. You want to film a thing. We're talking about it and then it just cuts off in the middle anyway. This is awful. This is terrible. But nonetheless, while I mentioned in the last show that I made a little note for my assistant to make me a Snapchat, just like someone totally out of touch would do, after the show, I forgot to delete that little instruction. I have actually ended up with a Snapchat. I thought, okay, just for completeness is sake. I'm going to install it on my phone and just see what it looks like. Maybe I'll do one thing and then I'll just never do it again. I just want to reiterate a thousandfold your described experience of even installing and using Snapchat at all is a completely baffling experience. Thank you. Thank you. I did have a lot of people saying it wasn't just you, Brady, but having it come from you is vindication because you're pretty up with the tech. I thought you might be exaggerating or just totally out of touch. Trying to get that thing installed and looking at the instructions, I thought, okay, I have to put this in. Okay, get this thing, take a picture of this. Then when it loads up, there's no labels on any buttons. The buttons seem intentionally obscure and somehow throughout the entirety of everybody describing it to me and everybody showing it to me, I somehow missed that it was purely video, that there was literally nothing you could do aside from video. As soon as I figured that out, I was like, oh, they're hell with this and I just deleted it off my phone. You can't take stills. Oh, okay. Well, I didn't get that far. But you just tap for that video button instead of holding it down. Oh, okay. It's completely baffling, great. It's like that it's seen in movies when people get into the alien spacecraft and there's like all different symbols on the dashboard and yet somehow they still manage to fly the spaceship. I feel like that's what the whole world is like with Snapchat. Flying the spaceship with symbols and controls. None of us understand. Anyway, I just have to completely agree with you. I feel like I was glad to have the experience of maybe 90 seconds of playing around with Snapchat just to see what it was like and then realizing, no, but I have no place for this in my life. It brings me absolutely no utility, no matter how much destined keeps pushing it, no matter how much he wants to drive up the value of his stocks in Snapchat. I am not going to use this thing. To be fair, it suits Destin because he's such a nice guy and he's really charming and he really likes interacting with as many people as possible and he lives in this world where his day lasts and 90 hours. So he has time to do this. As far as I can tell, he does not sleep. As I said before, I think it's less you. There has been an interesting development in the world of Snapchat since we spoke. You know how we have this delusion that like the world changes and continents move based on things we talk about on Hello Internet. I don't think it is a delusion. I think the more episodes we do, the more confirmation bias we have for this. Well you may remember, I think I mentioned this on the podcast and it was certainly something I felt. I felt a frustration about not being able to take past material and media and put it on the Snapchat. It always had to be immediate like I had to take a picture now and put it on. I couldn't go and get those beautiful pictures from Mount Everest five years ago and brag about that on Snapchat because you can't go and get stuff from the vault. Right, for a shame. Yeah. The funny thing is, within a day or two, I realized the error of my ways and I realized the strength of Snapchat was this immediacy. People couldn't Instagram it and make their lives look all amazing. It was unvarnished. It was like this really nice immediate contact. Everything disappears in 24 hours. The blackboard is constantly being wiped clean and I realized this was what was good about it and I embraced that now and then about a day or two after that, Snapchat Announce. They are now allowing people to do the exact thing that I wish they did and now I wish they wouldn't do but they are doing and you can take things from the vault and create this new area of Snapchat which I haven't looked at yet and I don't know how it works. I think it's called memories or something like that. In addition to your immediate day to day story, you can now go and get your perfectly crafted photos and Photoshop them and have nice vignettes and make everything look perfect and pretty and not the crazy unvarnished Snapchat which I think works better. It's all changed. Well, I trust that now that you have explained to Snapchat the errors of their ways, they will quickly revert this decision. If you've got a phone or a camera or a computer full of photos, why not liberate at least some of them into the real world? Nothing beats having some of your favourite memories hanging on the wall, sitting on the mantel piece or maybe poached on your desk and one of the best ways to do this is with fracture. Fractures are great service which prints your photos onto a piece of glass ready made for display. These bits of glass have a special rigid backing to make sure it's easy to hang but the product is super light really easy to handle. All you've got to do is simply upload the picture to their website, pick a size and fracture will do the rest at their factory or fractry in Florida. I've done it myself, it's painless and a pleasant process. I especially recommend fractures as gifts. If you've got a relative or a friend or a partner and you're stuck for a gift idea, you can never go wrong with a nice sentimental photo and having it fractured onto glasses also a real talking point when you give the present. It doesn't even have to be a birthday or an anniversary or anything like that, just give one as a gift out of the blue. That earns you even more branny points. Fractures are clean, frameless and beautifully finished. They come with a 60 day happiness guarantee. I'd recommend just having a look at their website to get you started. That explains everything really well and there's lots of pictures showing how it all works and what the finished product is going to look like. That website is fractureme.com. If you do order something, you'll get 10% off your first order by using the code HelloInternet. That's 10% off HelloInternet and they'll know you came from the show. Thank you to Fracture for their support and seriously give them a look. It's a really nifty product. So we have to talk about flags if we're going to have a classic episode. No. And we probably have to talk about emojis. Okay, okay. I have an emoji flag story. Oh, do you? A submission has been prepared and again, I'll try and link to it. I think it's been done by these people from emoji pedia and people in the emoji world have put in this formal submission to whoever you have to formally submit things to to have emojis recognized, to have the home nation flags made into official emojis. Because at the moment, there is the Union Jack representing the United Kingdom. But there is no England flag, there is no Wales flag, there is no Scotland flag. And I've actually found that quite frustrating. There have been times believe I'm not where I've wanted to use those flags and have been unable to literally not more than three hours ago. I wanted to send someone an England Wales emoji flag thing and discovered for the very first time that those home nation flags don't exist. I just assumed that they would be there, but they're not. Yeah. So I know there are sort of thin ends of the wedge and you can open the floodgates and where does this stop. But I think the home nations should be in the emoji sphere and I hope that this submission is successful. Well, I mean, if they're going to do the home nation flags, I think they absolutely have to do all 50 state flags. I think there's no way around that. No, this is not the case because I beg to disagree. And obviously they have to do the Liberian county flags. But yes, of course, right, just for fun, Z's, those need to be in there. Yes, I agree. But this home nation thing has been causing significant problems. For example, the European football championships, which are finishing today as we record the finals actually on shortly. There's no United Kingdom team in that. There's all these international teams and we have Wales competing and we have England. The same is true of the World Cup of Football. Now, Texas and California and Nevada and whatever don't have teams competing at the World Cup. But Scotland and Wales and England, these are countries, these are states. It actually causes formatting problems for some people who depend on emojis when all these tournaments take place. And I mean, I know there's more to the world than sport. But I was going to say, yes, I find you're solely because there are sports competing things not super convincing. Home nations and sports is always such a confusing, weird, historical thing that occurs that doesn't necessarily make any sense whatsoever, especially when you look at the population breakdown of Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland versus other places. So I'm definitely going to say this that if the home nations get accepted, I think the Moji committee or whoever is in charge of this, I think they have to do the individual state flags. I think there's no argument around this. I don't find your sports thing convincing. Just seriously for a moment, do you seriously believe that? Yes, I think they should do the state flags. What about the state flags of Australia? You know, I mean, let's be honest, who cares? Oh, so America can have its state flags. It's exactly right, exactly right. Listen, who cares? Right? Nobody. How often have you ever wanted to use a state flag for one of the states in Australia? Never. How often does someone from Texas want to use a Texas flag emoji? I bet every day of their life, Texans are sad that they don't have an official Texas emoji to use. I bet they're sad every day. Sad Texans in their hats. Yeah, well, is there not an emoji of like a cowboy hat or something? It's not the same as Texas. You know, and think of all of those states, they could have such a beautiful field of barely distinguishable blue icons with some kind of muddy yellow logo in the center. Each of them to pick from it. It could be amazing. I can already foresee the day where on the four inch screen of my iPhone SE, I am trying to distinguish the New York state flag by looking for a tiny, exelsie or written at the bottom of a banner or a smiling sun face in the middle of a field in the background, trying to distinguish that from all of the various other blue flags with a seal in the center. I look forward to that day. It could an emoji possibly contain the spectacular horror that is the Maryland state flag. I wonder how many pixels by how many pixels a standard emoji is. I mean, Apple did just make an announcement that they're going to embiggen their emoji by three times, even still I can easily imagine that when you have to pick it out in that tiny little keyboard at the bottom, there's simply no way to distinguish the flags and the Maryland flag. At least you'll be able to pick it out, but how much detail will it accurately represent of their flag? I bet none. In all seriousness, I do realize there would be a greater demand for American state flags than any other state flags. Of course. But you cannot put the American state flags in at the expense of other country states and counties, whereas I think the home nations of the UK, while not being quite as fully flared, don't get angry Scottish people as other countries, I think has a higher ranking and should be brought into the fold before we even have the conversation about state flags. Yeah, but how many people even live in Wales? I have to look this up now. Like 100,000 people. They just made the semi-finals of the Euros. More people live in Wales than Iceland, maybe. I haven't checked that fact. Yeah, I know. What is it? What have we got here, Wales? How many people do you live in Wales? Okay, there are 3 million people in Wales. Oh, that's way bigger than Iceland. And Iceland get an emoji? That's true. Iceland do get an emoji, but at least they are a fully sovereign nation. Oh, like they're on the world stage there. I agree. And that's why they're in and Wales is not yet. But I think Wales needs to come in before something even less sovereign, like Maryland. But does sovereignty matter or does the number of people in the world have that? I'm just saying, like we have to start somewhere, right? It's like, okay, we're starting with all the sovereign nations. Okay, obviously done. Although actually do they have all of the flags for the nations? I don't even know. I'm sure there's some nation out there that's really angry. Is there a Vatican city flag? I don't actually know. I wonder. But after that, I think you have to start looking at populations. And that's why I think you have to go with those state flags. Figure, you know, California, Texas, New York, there's hundreds of millions of people that live in those states. Well, hang on then. Are we going to start having like provinces of China before we have Texas then because they've got more people? Yeah, I could get behind that. Ah, go away. We've made it clear that the decision is based on sovereignty. That decision has been made. Okay, so we did the sovereignty level. And then I think after sovereignty, then you started looking at like what's the market demand for a California emoji versus a Northern Ireland emoji? Okay, great. I'm with you then. So are you now saying if all the Texans want a Texas emoji for some little tiny state, I don't know. What's the smallest state in America? I don't even know. It's the smallest in population. Like a Wyoming, of course. Wyoming is going to be a lot of us. Okay, Wyoming. And say there's not much demand from them. Does that mean they don't get into the emoji but Texas do? Or because we have one state flag of America, we get all the state flags at once. You have to do them as a collection, right? We do them as a collection. That's that's that's my argument. Okay, you can start with the Chinese provinces. Do them all as a collection and then move on to the American states. There's only so much labor we have in the world to create all of these emoji. Can you hear that, Gray? Can you hear that sound? What sound is that? The sound of your argument crashing down around you. I think it's perfectly solid. We have all the nations and then let's start going through everything else in the world by population divisions as sets though. I think I did notice in the submission and I could be wrong on this. In this submission, they were going for Scotland, Wales and England. But I don't remember saying Northern Ireland in the submission. Yeah, see now it's not even consistent. If that's true, that is inconsistent, maybe it's not true. But I did want to quickly ask you because we just love talking about flags and this is a classic episode. Right, of course. I know how you feel about the Union Jack. You think it's awesome. How do you feel about the flags of England, Scotland and in particular, Wales? Oh, I love that side. It says to me, Grace, taking this really seriously and you so rarely take me seriously that it makes me feel good. It's like you're settling in. I'm not just going to shoot from the hip on that one. This is going to require consideration. Like shoot from the hip. I don't think I shoot from the hip. I don't think you put a lot of thought into your answers when I ask you questions about say the black stump. I think you've just say anything to shut me up. But when you go, I can feel your brain warming up as you start to think about it. I love thinking about it. How do I feel about those various flags? I mean, the England one makes me kind of sleepy. I think the England one is a little boring. Do you know what I mean? I literally get kind of sleepy when I look at it. Yeah. But do you know what? Those really, really boring flags like England, which is from those who don't know, is just white with a red cross on it. Those flags say to me, this country's old man. This country's seen some stuff because the more boring your flag, usually the older you are because you didn't have to do anything complicated because they weren't that many other flags to compete with. So when someone's got a really, really boring flag, it says to me, you've got to take them seriously, man. They've seen stuff you can't even imagine. Like if you're a new country, like America, it's like, oh, let's just chuck some stars on there and some stripe. No, more stars, more stars. We've got to bling this baby up, man. You've got to get noticed. Whereas England's like, we don't need to be noticed, man. Like we're England. Just a cross on a white background. Yeah, that's all we had when we were making flags. Stars hadn't even been invented yet. Yeah. And also we couldn't die cloth. So that's why it's white. I guess I can try to incorporate that into my thoughts on it, but it's still just kind of makes me sleepy. Okay. Scotland, which is the, what's it called? The Saltaire isn't it? St Andrews Cross, isn't that it? It says here on my Google that Saltaire is another term for St Andrews Cross. So okay. Even though in theory the Scottish flag is essentially kind of like the same as the English flag because it's just now a white cross on a blue background, I feel like the Scottish flag is so much more exciting. It doesn't make me sleepy at all looking at it. I definitely give a thumbs up to the Scottish flag without a doubt. Yeah, I have to agree with you. I have to agree. I like the navy blue, the background of it. I just, I think it's, I think it's a very good color. Would you say navy blue? Yeah, maybe navy blue is not right. Navy blue is too dark. Yeah. I do not have a word in my vocabulary for the color of blue that the Scottish flag is, but I feel like it is identifiable as this Scotland blue color. I definitely like it. All right. Then what do we have here? I mean, the way I was flagged, I'm very curious to hear what you think of it. I mean, you have to talk about the Ulster banner for Northern Ireland. Well, I think in keeping with this submission, maybe we should just pretend it doesn't exist. Okay, sorry, Northern Ireland, we're going to skip you for today, which actually makes sense thematically for a thing that I'm going to show you and ask about. So whales, I don't know. I don't know about the whales flag. I'm never quite sure what to think about it, because on one hand, they have a dragon which takes up most of the flag and dragons are awesome. It's hard to argue against dragons, but at the same time, I'm not really sure that I like that dragon. I think like with many flag designs can suffer from being overly complicated and yet kind of childish at the same time. I have funny mixed feelings about that dragon. This is probably the best way to summarize my thoughts on the whales flag. The further away from it I am, the more I like it. But the closer I get to the whales flag, probably the less I like it. I think the whale flag is awesome. I realize that I probably shouldn't and I realize you probably shouldn't. I mean, certainly no child could draw it because that dragon is incredibly complicated. And you're right, it is a weird mixture of childish and complicated. I don't know. I think it's one of those things that's just been part of my life for so long that I kind of ignore that side of it. I just think it works. It just suits the country. And I don't know if it's because it actually suits the country or they've just been associated for so long in my head that I can't disentangle them. Right, this is of course the association problem that all these flags have. Where you are wrapping up your feelings of the nation with the flag itself in a way that's impossible to distinguish. Yeah. And I really like whales and I really like Welsh people because I'm not English. Most English people don't, but I'm not actually English, of course. I'm Australian. And because Welsh people hate English people and Australians hate English people, I feel like they're my brothers. Wow. Leave your comments on the reddit. That's some A plus tribalism right there, Brady. Dude, it all comes down to sport. So I think I'll ask your opinion on is I actually think that the Welsh dragon looks better simply as an outline, which I've seen in a few design motifs. Like if you just color the whole thing in as red, I think it's interesting. And there is a proposed version of the Union Jack flag, which I would like your opinion on, which combines the whales flag into it. Because right now there is no whales iconography on the Union Jack as it stands. So I have sent you an image and I'm curious to see what you think of this flag. OK. No fail. Fail? Not just because it's too bitty now and too complicated and the dragons too small. But also what Grey has sent me is essentially the Union Jack with a little tiny dragon right in the middle. And it almost puts too much emphasis on the dragon because everything's pointing at it and it's right in the center and it suddenly makes whales seem like it's the center of everything. That's a big fail. Big fail, huh? Big fail. What about you? What do you think of that? I think it's interesting, but it's also one of these things like mandatory voting that I can ever come to a solid opinion on. Every once in a while I remember this design of flag with the whales dragging in the center exists and I go back and I look at it. And I can never quite make up my mind about whether I like it or whether I don't, just like with mandatory voting. I go back and forth forever for 20 years about whether I think it's a good idea or not and I feel that exact same way about this flag. You can't mess with the Union Jack, right? That's like if you get a mess with that, where do you stop? Yeah, don't get me wrong. I would never propose that we actually change to this flag. It's just a question of do I think this is an interesting design or not? No, the Union Jack is an amazing flag. That will hopefully but possibly not live forever. I am keen to talk to you about Tesla because we didn't talk about it last time, but I know you had a ride in a Tesla for the first time. You broke your Tesla virginity. I want to know what you think about it. Now you've been in one. It's like obviously it's all more real. I was wondering if you'd tell me anything about it. I haven't asked you on or off the air and I'm really keen to know. Yeah, so our mutual friend Marco Arment actually gave me a ride in his Tesla. That was part of my travels this summer when I went to New York and it just worked out that I happened to be able to possibly meet up with Marco and then he dangled the idea of being able to ride in a Tesla in front of me and I was like, sold. I have to make this happen now. I went up to meet him and we got to drive around in the Tesla for a little while. First of all, Teslas are just super cool cars. There's no doubt about that. They just look cool from the outside. They're not looking. I had never actually sat in one on the inside and on the inside as well. The Teslas are just cool. Everything about them is super sleek, I think. One of the things that I wanted to see in the Tesla when we were driving around that is hard to get a sense of from just looking at pictures is how does this big screen work in the center because that's such the different thing about the interior of that car versus other cars? I kept looking out on the road as we're driving around and trying to see how does this screen work in my peripheral vision and especially because I am someone who, the older, I get I find I have more and more motion sickness in cars if I look down and look up even briefly to read. It's kind of curious to see if I'm looking out the window and then looking down at the screen and looking back up. I have to say because the screen is so huge, I think it really works on the interior. It was nice to see that they had thought through a bunch of clever design elements about how to control a bunch of things from the steering wheel or sections of the screen that never, ever, ever change so that in the bottom corners you can always have muscle memory for making the car do certain things. I think like temperature controls and some other stuff was down there. From the inside I was very, very impressed with the Tesla. I have to say I quite liked it. So Marco was showing off the super fast acceleration which I did not like because I don't appreciate the sensation of super fast acceleration though it was very impressive. I was like, you can keep showing this off if you don't mind cleaning the interior of your car shortly. That's a game you can play if you want to. But a bunch of the things that the car does as well just seem so natural. For example, there's no jarring because of gear changing. It just seems like this is the way cars should work. You don't miss it at all. Boy, I wish this car was really janky. Is it accelerated as it tries to manually shift through gears? It doesn't do that at all. That's fantastic. Then finally, the thing that I was most interested to see was a lot of the self-driving stuff in person. And I know that I am the wrong person to evaluate this in some ways because it's a thing that I have a lot of interest in. But I felt again, the self-driving stuff was all so natural that it was entirely unremarkable. There was no moment of, wow, I'm in a self-driving car and watching this thing trying to navigate the highway and stuff is like, yeah, this just seems natural. Just like no gear shifts, the self-driving stuff. It seems like this is just the way cars should work. This is the way I want these things to work. Does it just applaud along in its line? Like it doesn't change lines and do overtakes does it? Like how much does it do on its own at the moment? Yeah, so this was one of the things that it was a bit of a funny experience because in the discussion of how soon our self-driving cars coming, Marco owning a Tesla and actually using self-driving features thinks that I am being overly optimistic about how soon these things are going to arrive. And part of what he wanted to show me in the demo was situations under which it doesn't work or it doesn't always do precisely what you would expect it to do. And so he was trying to show me a bunch of this stuff. But my experience of sitting in the car was mostly thinking like, I think the car is doing pretty well. I think this is going great. There was a situation where we were on the highway and he has his hands off of the wheel on the car is driving on the highway. And what it does is it stays in its own lane and it tries to keep an appropriate distance from the car in front of it. But you can tell the Tesla I would like to turn lanes without actually forcing it to and so the car makes a decision about whether or not it's going to change lanes. And so Marco was able to essentially put the car in a situation where he told it to change lanes but the car wouldn't even though there was nothing blocking the way. The Tesla clearly thought that there was some reason it shouldn't change lanes even though everything was fine. Like a human driver would think it was okay. And I was looking at that and thinking, yeah, that's a mistake. The car should be changing lanes but it's not. But if the thing is overly cautious, I can hardly fault it. Yeah. I mean it's a pretty amazing thing. It's like God has parted the Red Sea and people are complaining that the sand is still a bit damp. Yeah, it's like, oh my feet are getting wet. I mean, I would be remiss therefore to not now bring up the fact we did have our first death. Yeah. In a Tesla, this obviously has crossed your radar. A Tesla had a crash while in this auto drive mode and lots of people have said, oh, I want to say about that. So what does Grace say about that? Well, it had to happen, didn't it? Yeah, that's exactly it. It was absolutely inevitable that somebody would die eventually in a Tesla. And I think the very fact that that is a news story goes to show you how like this is incredibly rare. And I forget what the numbers are, but Tesla came out with the numbers, but like how many millions and millions of human miles have been driven in the auto pilot system. And now we finally have one person has died. To me, this stuff is always just a question of there's some group of people who think it needs to be perfect before people start using it. And I am not in that group. My only question is, is it better than human drivers? And again, like the Tesla can't drive point to point. There's lots of things it can't do. There's lots of ways it's kind of cheating. So like one of the things Marker showed me that I didn't know is that on local roads where the Tesla is clearly much more uncertain about turns and speed limits and all the rest of this, it has a kind of cheating mode where it'll follow a car in front of it on local roads in situations where it seems like it couldn't self drive itself. And I thought, oh, that's interesting. This is a case where yes, on a local road, it is much more limited and it does weigh better on a highway. So again, this stuff isn't self-self-driving, but it's like, I really feel like it's going to be better than human drivers very shortly. Yes, people will die, but horrific numbers of people die on the roads right now. So when people sent via Twitter in a whole bunch of other ways, like, oh my gosh, what do I think about someone dying in a Tesla? It's like, well, I don't really think about it very much. I just do not think it matters. I don't think it's an important news story in any way. Do you disagree with that? No, I don't actually. I agree with you. I mean, I don't want to sort of fire up the cheer pressure or have people pile on. And I know there's all this debate about the incident itself. But if it was caused by the fact that the camera and the computer couldn't tell the difference between the white side of a lorry and the white sky, that is quite a motive. It's quite a good, scare story. And if that is the case, I hope they fix it. But I kind of agree. Let's speak cliche, but you know, people die and blame crashes all the time. It doesn't stop us flying and things like that. So I think it's not like a big, big deal. But this move to self-driving cars is less of a technology battle and more of a battle for hearts and minds. I have to say, I've come to your way of thinking. You know, I always thought this was further away in the future than you did. And I now think it's closer. It just seems to be all happening so quickly now, so many trials, so many implementations in sort of real-world environments that I thought was a bit further down the road. It's already happening. So I'm sort of thinking, Gray was right on this one. I think this is going to happen quick now. A question I have for you because you are much more plugged into the news than I am. Because my only experience of hearing about this story is people individually contacting me about it. But I'm willing to bet that this story is not gaining a huge amount of traction. It is a news story. And of course, the news is filled with anomalous events, that's basically what the news is, a collection of things that are unusual. But is this gaining lots of traction? Like are people super concerned? Or is this just yet another in the endless stream of news stories that just washes by, that nobody really cares about two weeks later? It happened at a good time for Tesla because there are so many other massive things happening in the world at the moment that in the fight for news time and coverage, it probably didn't get as much as it could have. But it got fair big, it got fair big. And it's still coming up. It's still being brought up in articles and I'm still seeing it around the place. When you say it's a battle for hearts and minds, I'm not even convinced that that's the case. I think there has been a real silent shift in people's thoughts on self-driving cars. I have a feeling that much, much more of the population feels that, oh, this is just a thing that's coming. And I don't bet that this is going to be like a big story that causes problems for Tesla in the long run. I have a hard time imagining that's going to be the case. I think you're right. I think the only thing that's going to hurt Tesla and the other people advocating self-driving cars will be. It will be a spate or like some kind of glitchware three or four happen in the same way. So I think you're right. I think the one off hasn't hurt them really badly. And they'll only get hurt if there's some systematic problem. It was there anything you didn't like about the Tesla? Well, it was funny because when I was sitting in the car and we're driving along the road, I'm thinking, wow, everything in this Tesla seems amazing. I love this future space car. I wish I could have any reason to buy one. No reason at all. I wish I could have reason to buy one. I asked Marco the same question. I said, is there anything about this car that you don't like? And he had a couple of minor dislikes about it, but overall, he seemed really, really happy with the car as well. And so I feel like I had nothing in particular to say, like, oh, I didn't like this about the car. It struck me as totally wrong. And the owner of the car had a few complaints, but nothing I can even remember at this later point of being like, oh, wow, that's a really good point. That is a really annoying feature that I wouldn't have thought about or wouldn't have realized until I own it. It's just like, nope, everything about this car seems amazing. So two thumbs up for Tesla. This episode of HelloInchNet is brought to you by Igloo. Now many of you might be working at a big company with an internet that is just a terrible, terrible piece of software to work with. I mean, actually, is it even really a piece of software?

Brady's paper cut. There's a lot of sport going on in the world at the moment, Gray. Oh boy. There always seems to be eye na to you. Isn't there always sports? There should always be sport because people love sporting events. So there should always be sporting events going on, right? Yeah, but there's been a rich vein just lately. Oh, okay. Anyway, anyway, like always. Yeah. So everyone's saying to me, oh tell Gray about Iceland at the Euros or Wales at the Euros or tell him about this or tell him about that. And there's no point doing that. Oh, thank you. I'm not going to do that. Oh, thank you. Yeah. A few nations that have had unexpected success in the Euros does not compare to my mind with the amazing story that is Lester City. Just because I brought up that Lester City story, I'm not going to bring up every underdog story that happens in sport on the podcast because Gray will probably stop being my friend. Yeah. Very likely. Imagine I have just as much peace for this stuff as your wife would. Some, some, but not an infinite well. Okay. So all the sport I've been watching lately and the media coverage lately has brought up two things. There's two things I've noticed that get my goat that annoy me. Okay. So I thought I'd bring them up. One is when commentators and pundits and people telling the story of sport talk about getting revenge or banishing memories. And I think there's a real inequality in it that shows how much they live in the moment. Let me give you an example. Play two teams play in the World Cup final. Say Liberia plays China in the World Cup final. Okay. Right. And Liberia win. The next time those two countries meet and it could be in a lesser tournament and it could be like in the quarter finals. And this time China win. Commentators always say they got their revenge. They banish the memories of that World Cup loss and they finally got their revenge on Liberia by beating them. That is not revenge. The only way you can get like total revenge for a sporting loss is to have an equivalent game like another World Cup final. And this time win. That's the only way you can erase the memory or get them back or square the ledger. But because sports people always want to hype up the current game, they'll always say this game is a chance to get revenge for that previous game. It is not revenge if it is not the same tournament at the same level. Beating someone in a quarter final four years after you lost in the final. That's not revenge. And noise me. I thought you were going to say the only way for China to get revenge in this scenario would be to take over an annex Liberia. Let me tell you what revenge is. It is wiping Liberia off the face of the earth. Does taking turns winning a game you're playing with each other? Is there any way that that can even remotely count as revenge? No, it cannot. No, no. That would be going the other way. I think the whole premise of even revenge in a sporting event doesn't make any sense. Even if the games are equivalent, it still doesn't make any sense at all. It's like you're playing a game with each other and someone won and then someone else won, as will inevitably happen. Revenge is something that you plot stealthily for for years and like you spring upon your opponent when they have no idea what's going to happen, as opposed to a thing that takes place within a rigid and ordered system that has rules that we all agree on. I don't think the concept of revenge makes any sense in this whole arena. Well, okay. Maybe you don't like the word revenge. But there's this whole thing about squaring the ledger. Getting them back for the defeat and say, you defeat us in this game. Now we defeated you. Everything's even. I say everything is not even if the game is not of the same importance. But commentators don't seem to realize that. They want to hype up the game they're talking about. No, I'm sure they totally do realize it, but they're doing what you're saying. They're just trying to hype it up. It's just like the news, Brady, right? They know a lot of the stuff that they're talking about is dumb and won't matter in a week, but they want to hype it up so that it feels like it's really important right now. Maybe without analogy. Yeah, there's a bit of that. Moving right along. And the other thing that's really getting my nerves at the moment, especially in the world of sport, but I know it pervades all media, is this thing everyone does where they use three words and they punctuate it. There's a lot of sport in my Twitter feed and say someone scores a goal in a game of sports ball. There will be this tweet from some supposedly reputable organisation, usually the BBC. Suddenly writing like some teen vlogger and they will say what a goal, all capitalised, which I hate because that's like the internet equivalent of shouting. And there will be a full stop after every word. What? Full stop. A full stop. Go. Oh man, that annoys me. It annoys me. Apparently there are forums and things dedicated to people who hate this, but this is really getting me at the moment. Are you familiar with this? It's becoming good with a memey thing to do, isn't it? To sort of have these three punctuated words to add emphasis. Yeah, this is just people trying to communicate on the internet with the limited bandwidth that you have for Twitter. I have not seen this in particular. Maybe this is a sporting thing that will eventually bleed over into my internet as well. It happens in politics as well a bit, I think. Yeah. Sports and politics, the two things I follow so closely. So no, I have not seen these on my Twitter timeline. When this episode comes out, I'm going to tweet brand full stop, new full stop episode. Perfect. Hashtag, hello, internet. Right. And you know what? Let's see if just like clickbaiting headlines, we get tremendous traffic from that tweet, right? We tweet it all over the place. People will go nuts for it, right? That's probably why people are doing this, so people like it. All right, everyone. Go ahead, send me your three word tweets. And I'll block you. I'll tell you what, what are we going to keep clashing on here, grow? You're going to let me keep going? As always, I feel like the first half, three quarters, 80% of the show is always somehow like out of my control. Yeah. And then I let you drone on for 20 minutes at the end while I have a little nap. Exactly. You're like, I'm going to let me go on. It's like, no, Brady's just throwing out topics. Let's do that. Let's do that. Okay, go with this. Maybe we'll cut that. Maybe we won't. Who knows, right? You stop with these little moments. You're like, oh, can I try this? It's like, whatever, man, I know at this stage, you're just going to go with it. So what do you want to do next in our classic episodes? What do you think is going to happen next? Well, you know what the most requested corner is of all. Even you must know this. Plane crash corner. You said it. All right, is there a plane crash that you want to talk about? I do want to talk about a plane crash. But first of all, I want to tell you that I flew for the first time. By the way, I haven't said, but I'm in San Francisco at the moment and you're back in England. It's like we're alternating between episodes. We essentially passed each other like ships in the night, one going to and one coming from California. So yeah, we are. We did. We are now in opposite positions, again, recording with, of course, California's fantastic time zone shift, which makes everything super convenient. But I flew in the, and I think it must have been the first time I flown in one in the 787 Boeing 787, the Dreamliner. Oh. Oh, the Tesla of the skies, maybe. Maybe. And maybe I'm overstating the case a bit there, but it is super high tech. I don't know if you've been on one, but the thing that blew my mind was the windows in this plane. Are you familiar with the windows in the Dreamliner? I've heard of this plane. I have never been in one. I've never really looked it up. I'm just pulling up some pictures now, but what's up with the windows? Because from the outside, at least, they look like normal windows. Yeah, they're a little bit bigger than normal, but also they have in them this electric gel. So there's no shutter that you pull up and down. There's just buttons underneath and you press buttons and it tints the window to different levels depending on your setting. And also it puts this strange hue in the window. So if you're flying in the middle of the day, I happen to fly in the middle of the day from England to California, which can be quite disorienting and not that good for your body. But it casts this bluey hue across the windows for most of the flight. So it looked like night outside. The sun looked like the moon and all the landscape had this bluey look to it like it was nighttime. And it felt like it was night. It was amazing. So you could still look out the window and see the terrain below. But you felt like you were looking over the US at night. And then if you went and found a window that didn't have this on, it was like broad daylight. So it was really cool. It was a really nice gimmick. We could individual people turn on and off the blue effect. Is that something that was under your control as the window seat person? I'm not entirely sure, but the impression I had was you could control it yourself at certain times and at other times I think they took control of it so that you couldn't have one idiot streaming the cabin with bright light while everyone else was trying to sleep. On my flight to America I was the one idiot who had the window open. I didn't realize until the flight attendant came over and gave me a harsh talking to. It's like, oh sir, everybody else in this cabin is asleep. Why, I should close your window. I'm sorry. I'm trying to do work. Anyway, that's not my playing crash. Thank goodness because I was on that plane. Right, right. But let me give you a playing crash corner. And this is something that made the news a little while ago now. And I didn't bring it up because we haven't done a podcast for so long and we talk about lots of other stuff. But this caught my attention because I also has told me something about myself, which I want to ask you about at the end. First of all, let me tell you the story. You like this because it's got an obscure pompous name. I want to tell you about Operation Thoniper. Thoniper? I'm sure my pronunciation is incorrect because this is an incongod of knowledge. And basically, to start from the beginning, there was a flight on January 1st in 1985. This is in flight 980. And this was a flight that was going from Paraguay to Miami and it was going to stop in a couple of other places on the way. This is in 1985. 1985. Okay. Don't trust me. Trust me, Gray. We'll get in there. All right. All right. Take my hand and leave me through this journey then. Hold my hand. It will all make sense at the end. Okay. This plane with 29 people on it, I think it was 19 passengers and 10 crew, which is quite a high ratio of crew to passengers, actually. And what is called a seafit crash. This is a controlled flight into terrain, which I think is a lovely way of saying it flew into a mountain. Okay. And it flew into this mountain called Mount Illamani in Bolivia. And it hit the mountain at a height of about 6,000 meters. And I think to this day, that's the highest ever seafit crash there's been. Okay. That's the highest a plane's ever been when it flew into a mountain. Everyone died. So this was obviously quite a hard spot to get to, but they did send investigators. And a little piece of side trivia here, the lead investigator they sent was a guy called Greg Feath or 5th. And anyone who watches Air Crash Investigation, my favorite TV show, will know this guy, because this is like the talking head that they bring in to talk about every plane crash. He's like the dialer quote, sort of guy. He's quite a well-known crash investigator because of that. He was called in. They went up the mountain. It was covered in snow. The debris was all over the place. It was like a huge crash site. Everything was smashed to smithereens. Basically they couldn't find anything particularly useful. And they left. 1985. They didn't find the flight recorders. Right? Okay. Way up this mountain. In 2006, some of the wreckage started revealing itself because snow was melting in this glaciers and rocks and stuff moving around. And some of the wreckage started revealing itself again. Now what happened was there were these two guys called Dan and Isaac. I think they're from Boston or Massachusetts somewhere. And they read about this. And they sound like my kind of guys because they're interested in plane crashes and they're interested in mountains. And they saw that the flight recorders had never been found. And they looked up other crashes where flight recorders haven't been found. And there's quite a few of them. Most of them are deep under water. But this one obviously isn't this one's on land. So this year, just recently, they decided to go on like an adventure holiday to this mountain to try and find the crash site and try and find the flight recorders from this 1985 crash. I can't believe you haven't combined your interests of mountains and plane crashing to do this exact same adventure. Do. That's why I'm talking about it. I can't believe I didn't think of it. So these dudes are legends. So they've gone to this mountain in Bolivia in a place that sounds like it's not without challenges of various sorts. And I've got a few people to help them. They've gone up this mountain. They found this crash site in all the rock and the crevasses and everything. And they've started finding bits of metal. And I think they've spent three or four days there. And on the final day, they've turned over a piece of metal, which turns out to be orange on the other side, which is the color of black boxes. Funnily enough, as everyone knows, black boxes are orange, of course. And it's got this cable off it saying CVR, cockpit voice recorder. And they find part of the flight recorder. And they find some magnetic tape as well, which is probably what was in the recorder and some other bits and pieces. And I doubt they're going to get much from it in because it happened in 1985, but they've brought this stuff back in the hope of maybe finding out more about what happened to this crash. But I just think it's amazing that these two dudes who are like, just dudes have said, man, let's go to where that crash happened up that mountain in Bolivia and see if we can find the flight recorder that will be investigated and they go there and they find it. That is great. I love it when people just do a thing and I still say the intersection of these interests. It's amazing to me that you have not considered doing this before. I think there is a market in going to famous plane crash sites. I know for a fact of one famous plane crash site, also in South America that people do do too as to. This is the one where the plane crash happened from the film Alive, where the people spent months and months with their wreckage in the mountains and they ended up eating the dead bodies of people who died in the crash to stay alive and then they got rescued all this time later. You're familiar with this crash, or? Yeah, I think that's other movie alive. It's so really famous and people do go on tourist trips to a site where that happened. But really? They do. Yeah, I was looking at the internet, looking at the prices. No, you're better. Because it's in the mountains as well. I love mountains. It's got everything. It's got mountains, it's got drama. It has everything. I think the dream one to go to for me would be Mount Aerobus in Antarctica, where a plane famously crashed because there you're going up a mountain, you've got a plane crash site and it's Antarctica. I don't know. I don't know if you can go there. So what's going to happen here, Brady? I mean, are you trying to tell me slowly and gently that you're going to incorporate a mountaineering stroke, plane crash, cornering tourist business? Is that what your next venture is going to be? Because that's what it sounds like. That's what you're working toward. I'm not working towards it. The thing I wanted to bring up, the reason I found this interesting was when I first heard about this, I had a bit of a reluctance to read about it because they had a blog and stuff like that. I think they went with the journalists, so there's obviously more stuff to come, but I was initially a little bit reluctant to read about it. This is a feeling I often have that I want to see if it's just me, whether other people have this, but I sometimes don't enjoy reading or watching about other people's cool adventures. Because I think, well, that's their cool adventure, and I'm not having that. So why do I want to watch them doing something awesome? I want to do something awesome. My wife doesn't understand this quite often. She now understands it because it's what I'm like. But for example, if there's a documentary like Michael Palin goes and does a great travel show through the Himalayas, she's like, oh, let's watch that. It'll be so inspirational and you'll see so much amazing stuff. I'm like, I don't want to go and watch Michael Palin have a cool adventure in the Himalayas. That's good for him. That's him having an awesome time. That's not me having an awesome time. So I really, very often don't like watching travel shows because I feel like I don't want to watch someone else doing something cool. I'd rather spend my time doing something cool myself. Is that weird? I'm not going to say it's weird because I'm talking to you. I think I can understand why you wouldn't want to do that. But I can say that it's abnormal. There's no way that that's not abnormal. Yeah, I guess because those TV shows are so popular. So obviously lots of people like what they do. Right. Exactly. Most people want to watch those kinds of things. They want to sit in the comfort of their own home and watch somebody else have an adventure. Isn't that exciting to see somebody else do this thing? Isn't it entertaining to see somebody else go on an adventure? I definitely don't. Unless it's something I can't do. Like go to the moon. Right. That is not my attitude. So when I first heard about this operation, Thoniper with Dan and Isaac, my first instinct was, well, I don't want to see that because they just have in the coolest adventure and I could have done that. And now I'm going to be thinking, why aren't I doing that? But this was just too cool that I had to look and these guys are clearly legends for doing this. So it's a cool story. They've got a blog, go and read about it. They've done a cool thing. Playing crash, mountains, live in the dream. If you did a TV adventure, like some TV station contacts you and they say, we're going to hook you up with traveling the world, amazing adventure thing and we're going to film it and we're going to make a documentary about it, right? After it was done and over, would you want to watch your own adventure on TV? Yeah. Okay. Okay. Watching that. Because that's like my holiday photos. Okay. Okay. So that's what it is. So you wouldn't feel like, I don't want to watch me having an adventure. I already had that adventure. I want to go on the next adventure. No. No, no, no, no, no. It's not that. I did a video when I went to Everest Basecamp where I boiled water all these different outitudes. A video of yours, I love, by the way. I'm going to put that in the show notes. I think there's something fantastic and beautiful about that video. It's one of my favorite things that you've ever done is that video. Thank you. That's really kind. And I don't watch my videos back very often. But that is one of my videos that maybe once every six months or I will watch again and enjoy just as watching it. But I don't think I would enjoy watching someone else do it. Well, maybe I would enjoy someone else doing that because I've been there. But I find it hard to watch other people having really amazing adventures. I'm happy for them. I don't want them to have a good time and have those adventures. I think it's brilliant. But it's just like watching it just frustrates me. I'm like, oh, that's something I should be doing. That looks awesome. So for clarity, say, it's not any kind of envy. You don't envy them their experience. You just feel like you should be having the adventure. I think I kind of do envy it, but I don't begrudge them it. I'm not upset that they're having it. I'm happy that they're having it. But I guess it only applies to things I could conceivably do. Like for example, I don't mind watching Andy Murray win Wimbledon lift the trophy. I'm not thinking, dammit, why are I winning Wimbledon? Because I get that I can't win Wimbledon. So I watched that. Right. I was trying to close in on what are the edges of this thing? And it's like fiction doesn't seem to be like you're fine with watching fiction because it's not real. And you don't feel like I should be saving Middle-Earth. I think that's how you feel about it. No, no. I don't know exactly what it means. That's why I bring it up. I don't completely understand it. Well, obviously it means that you must be having adventures all the time if this is the way you feel about it. No, of course. Yeah, I mean, I should, I'd love to have it. Obviously, I'm not. Most of the time I'm sitting around editing videos and eating donuts. But I find that not an enjoyable use of my time watching other people have nice holidays. And so the holidays, right? Because I wouldn't enjoy watching other people have nice holidays either. That sounds like terribly boring television. And also it's like a totally different kind of thing. Whereas I'll happily watch somebody have an adventure. I'll happily watch all of those survival shows where people slowly starve to death over the space of a month. Like, great. No. I'll turn that on for entertainment any day of the week. But someone having a holiday, no, that sounds terribly boring. I mean, I love a good documentary about someone like climbing a mountain, like proper mountaineering, like, you know, something happening on K2 and stuff like that. Wait, how is that different than watching a documentary? Because I can't do that. Okay. Because I can't do that. You can't climb K2. Definitely not. Okay. I don't have ever said before, but the summit on Netflix about people climbing K2 is the best mountain documentary I've ever watched. You should watch that, Gray. It's the best one. If I can only watch one, I should watch that one. If you only watch one mountain thing ever, watch the summit. Okay. It's on Netflix. It's really good. Watch it, man. Watch it. You watch it and we'll talk about it. Okay. All right. Note me. I've watched it three or four times. But I'm not watching Michael Paylon drinking tea and having a nice time with people as he walks through the Himalayas. One other thing it feels like we have to do in a classic, classic episode is, well, you call it the biweekly way in. Oh, this. This is what you want to do. It's more of a health corner. I don't want to do this, but it's not a classic episode. If we don't do, like, Gray's health corner where he smuggly tells me how awesome he is now and how I'm still super unfit. Is that how this works? Is that how this has ever worked? Where is that your own personal resentment? No. Yeah. Maybe it's like watching a documentary. I don't want to watch a documentary about how Gray's becoming really healthy. Yeah. Okay. I love this. You don't want to do it. Trying to make me look bad, but you're still going to bring it up as a corner. Okay. So sure. Sure. What do you want to talk about in the Hello Internet semi-random? Sometimes we talk about health if Brady's in the mood or we're doing a classic episode corner. So the thing I'm wondering, I guess, is you know, you reached your target weight and everything was good and you did a great job. Like, what have you done since? Have you, like, kept, like, the same regime or was your regime able to now change to keep a steady weight or did your weight go up? Like, since you kind of hit your target and everything was good, what's been your course of action since? I mean, it's interesting because I just came back from spending a month in America, right? Fatland. Fatland, USA. Population, Lord. Right? It's so difficult here, man. It's, you know, but like, everything, everything in America is incredibly delicious and so good. And all I can say is when I go to America, the thing I always think of now is, thank God, at least, I'm not in the South, which is like America's America, right? Everything is just amplified again with deliciousness. So I was like, okay, at least I'm just in California. I only have to deal with that level of how good all of the food is. Before you tell me about what's happened since you came back from America, I mean, I am in California and I'm in Berkeley, which is like, you know, trendy, healthy place too. But even here, it's difficult. I was in Safeway last night and I just fancied some cookies. So I went to the cookie section and I just wanted a few cookies and I went to this huge table where they sell all the cookies. I could not find a box of cookies that they were selling that had less than 30 cookies in it. It wasn't an option. I just like, I just want to buy like two or three of those cookies, but you couldn't, you could only buy these huge, huge, clear boxes full of cookies. And then I went, there is this pizza place right near where I'm staying called the cheese board, which is really famous. It does really nice pizza. And I went there the other night and I was lining up in the queue because there's always a huge queue for the pizza, but it was nearly closing time. And when I got to order my pizza, I did the discipline thing and I ordered only half a pizza because they always throw you a few extra pizzas beyond what you order anyway. It's like a tradition. Okay, that's interesting. Oh, they always do it. So I knew I was going to get half a pizza plus two or three slices. So I said, can I have half a pizza place? And because it was near closing time and they still had lots of pizzas because they only make one flavor pizza and they just churn them out. That's just what you have to have that day. So when I ordered half a pizza, they said, no problems. Gave me a whole pizza in the box, gave it to me. And then just as I was about to walk away, he winked at me and said, I'll buy the way. And he gave me a second whole pizza. And so here's another one for it. I tried to do the right thing and order half a pizza and I walked away with two pizzas. And I'm on my own. I was just a lonely guy walking back to my Airbnb with two whole pizzas. People just shaking their heads. Look at me. Look at that dude. Look at that dude. Two pizzas, buddy. You should not be eating two pizzas, my friend. That's when you need to buy several drinks, like a six pack of soda, just so it looks like you're bringing supplies to your party instead of just like, oh, here's me with my two pizzas and my one diet coke. So it's really clear that I intend to eat all of this by myself. Right, you need camouflage drinks to cover that. Yeah. Just holding your phone to your ear even though you're not using it saying, yeah, yeah, I'll be there in a minute, guys. Yeah. Right. Keep the party going. Oh, God. So anyway, you're back from fat layer. Yeah, but I'm laughing as well because that's my experience to California. I mean, like nobody handed me two pizzas with a wink and a smile. But I did have this feeling that like, oh, it's going to be way easier in California, at least to eat healthier because there are a bunch of hippies. But it's like, you know what? It's still so hard. And even the healthy stuff comes in enormous portions. And when you're surrounded by everything else, like, do I really want to go to like granola barn or do I want to go to I hop? It's like, I want to go to I hop. That's what I wanted to do. It's just so hard. Okay. So the interesting thing here is we sort of touched upon a while ago that I had been changing some of my morning routines with like pret and getting coffee in the mornings and doing a bunch of stuff. And over time, I eventually kind of stumbled upon the realization that breakfast is an optional meal if you're mentally prepared for that. Which is an interesting thing to kind of realize in my life that all of my life, I have always thought, oh, if I don't have breakfast, things will be just absolutely terrible. But over the past several months, I have slowly learned that breakfast is optional. As long as I'm psychologically prepared for that fact when I get up in the morning, that I know I'm going to skip breakfast. So don't even try it stomach. And we're going to eat later. We're going to eat it lunch. So this is a piece of information that I kind of discovered about myself over time. And one of the things that I decided when I was going to fatland USA was that I was going to intentionally skip breakfast in the morning for the entire time that I was there. Because I thought at the very least, this will be some kind of damage minimization process because I am a man who loves his breakfast. And America is a land that does breakfast really well. And so I thought, I'm just going to take this out as an option to try to reduce calorie intake. And much to my surprise, even though I wasn't super great about eating stuff in America, especially during conference time, when you keep meeting up with people and like everywhere you go, you're meeting someone for a meal and you're eating something or I just find what I'm like drained from talking with people all the time. Like I just really want to eat something to kind of pick up my energy. I was kind of crap with the food, but I think skipping breakfast really worked because Miracle of Miracles, I came back from America a single pound heavier after a month, which I felt like was a tremendous, tremendous victory. No. Great. You've cracked the nut, mate. I've got to give it to you. You've done it. Yeah. I mean, not to glow in your face or anything, but I'm still under 200 pounds. I'm 199 again. Like America just nudged me ever so slightly over 200 pounds. I am again, back under 199. So that's where we are for the biweekly, not biweekly at all. In living, you're living the fidgetron 5000, Drain. Except there's one thing, if we're ever going to bring back the occasional biweekly way and actually talking about health corner, which I have let go because as someone once told me, if you love a biweekly way and you have to let it go and if it comes back then it was meant to be, so I'm never going to push anything. But I will say the one place that I have consistently and frustratingly failed is with the running. I have still not been able to run a complete 5K without doing a significant portion of it actually walking. And it's weird because I haven't given up the running. I find that I've gone for stretches of not doing it. And so then I'm not in shape to do it and I kind of have to start over with the program. And so that is a place where I have definitely fallen down on it. So like just throwing it out there, but we could always do something with the running because I do feel like being on the public hook, it's helpful. And you seem to be much better at the running than I am. I did bring my running gear with me and I went for a run the other morning and I just started, I wanted to get to the bay, to the coast from where I'm staying, which is a bit of a run. So I was running and running and ended up being further than I expected and took me longer than I expected to get there. So eventually I got to the waterfront and thought, oh this is nice. But I'd gone so far. I was like, oh now I'm really, really far from home. So I got an Uber home. That's fair. That's totally fair. It does feel a little bit sad when you're in your running gear and you're getting an Uber back to where you started. But I did a fair run. I have to say, like even when I'm unfit and I am unfit, I am able to still be able to still run. It does remind me of something, I think this is the nicest thing anyone has ever said to me and this is something my wife said to me. When we were in Bhutan, we did a couple of like long walks up mountains and stuff and my wife's a really fit person. Like she goes to the gym all the time and she's in great shape and we were climbing up these mountains and sometimes I was doing it like as strong as her. Sometimes I'll be walking in front of her and I'm not fit. And like I wouldn't be drinking water and I just soldier on up the hill even though I'm struggling. I just keep going. And she did say to me at one point, you just have so much grit, like you shouldn't be able to do this but you're just so stubborn that you just keep going. Like I guess it's the hardest nails thing. I was going to say, did she turn to you and say you're horrid as nails? No, she would never say that. But I liked the word grit. She knows I'm not fit but I've just have like this stubbornness that even though my body shouldn't be able to do it. I'm just like, well I'm not stopping. That's for whips. So running's never really a problem. But you're right, maybe running is the key for me and for you as well. Maybe we'll come up with some kind of rivalry. Maybe we'll have a race one day. Maybe this is the thing that we can revisit. I'm not going to pressure anything. I will never mention it. I will, you know, I'm just letting it go. There you go. There you go. We've done a biweekly way in health to sometimes occasionally corner. So I think we've ticked most of the boxes for a classic episode. I think we have as well. Are you happy Brady? Yeah.

I kind of don't want to hire there, but I think we kind of have to. There's been so much happening in the world of elections and politics and stuff. But the big one, and I'm getting asked about it all the time since arriving in America, is the UK Brexit vote, the referendum about whether or not the UK was going to stay in the European Union or leave the European Union. You were out of the country for this, weren't you? Yeah, I was out of the country. I was at VidCon when the vote actually happened. When the results came in again because of the confusing timeline, it was late in LA. And suddenly I started getting messages from people and realizing, oh, right, everybody is waking up in the UK right now to votes having been counted. So that's where I was when it occurred. And if you're listening on the planet Mars and don't realize the UK voted, I think it was 52% voted to leave the European Union. Yeah, it was 52 to 48 to leave the European Union quite a high turnout. It was in the 70s, I think, percentage turnout. So quite a strong turnout. Yeah, I saw some comparisons. It was like the highest voter turnout in decades for anything. Not only is just like the number of voters high, but it's the percentage of the possible electorate was also unusually high for the election. So tons of people turned out. So there you go. Supposedly, the UK is now going to leave the European Union. Yeah, I mean, this is so many people want us to talk about it. But it's one of those things as well. Like I haven't been following the details super closely. Like when it was first announced and when I was in LA, I did kind of follow the news for a while. But it was, it was mainly because I was supposed to be at some party and I was being a cramudge and I'm like, this party is really loud. I don't want to be here. It's hard to talk to people. And then suddenly when news starts rolling in, it's like, wow, news seems like a much more attractive option. So I just like left and sat down on Twitter for a while trying to read through news stories and see what's going on with Brexit. Like as the results were actually coming in because at first it was, it looks like this is the way it's going to happen. And then it really did become official. So I kind of followed it right at the start. And then I have only heard some of the major beats of this that have occurred in the past two weeks. But as you might expect with the thing, like I haven't been following it super, super close every day. I mean, since it happened, the British politics has just like exploded. Like it's been crazy. But I don't think that's particularly what most people would like to hear about because that's probably of more interest to British people. But it's like, it has been like House of Card since because obviously the Prime Minister resigned. And then there's been all sorts of Machiavellian machinations going on and like stuff you couldn't make up and everyone's resigning and stabbing everyone in the back. And you couldn't make it up. But I guess that's kind of the fallout. The result itself, I mean, we surprised, we pleased. Is it what you expected? Are you disappointed? Do you have any feelings about what happened? I mean, well, if you go back and listen to our episode where we talk about this before it occurred, I feel like I'm probably have a lot of the same feelings. Like I made it pretty clear in that episode that my position is that it would be better for the UK to stay in. And that was your position as well. And also the thing that it talked about at that time was it's a very hard thing to discuss in any meaningful way. And part of the reason that I haven't followed the politics super closely this time around is because I feel it's the same thing again. Like when I look into what's going on with Brexit, it's like, okay, we did this vote. People voted. There is a clear outcome from the vote. Like that is not in any amount of uncertainty. But what happens next? It seems like it's the same problem again. Who knows? Like there's no details. There's no procedure. There's no plan. There's no prime minister to enact anything. I know the people who fought for it have all left the ship. It's like people set fire to the house and then walked away. Yeah. What you're describing there is it's like the leader of UKIP resigned and there's been a whole bunch of other things about like people who were prominent Brexit cheerleaders who kind of want nothing to do with it after it actually happens. Which I don't think is any kind of like real surprise in some ways. But it does mean that at the time of recording we are in this position where it is just a total shrugging shoulders, hands up in the air emoji about what is actually going to occur. What's going to happen? It is unknown. What do you think? What do you think? Well, obviously I have trepidation about speaking about politics in a public forum because people feel so strongly about it. Most people are pretty entrenched in their positions. And you could say I'm entrenched in my position. So like it's not like you're going to persuade anyone of anything. You're either just going to have people agree with you or get angry at you. It's not really a discussion. But I'll talk about it. People who follow me on Twitter probably know what I think about it. Because after we spoke about it on the podcast, probably in the last week or two before the vote itself, I've started to feel more strongly about it. And I really hoped that we would stay as part of Europe. And I started following the debate a lot more closely. And a lot of things happened in the last week or two before the vote, which we don't need to go into all the details. But I hoped we would stay. Now all the people I'm friends with think the same as me on Facebook and a lot of my Twitter feed and all that. So I was surrounded by a lot of reinforcing comments where everyone was saying we have to stay. We're going to stay. It's all great. Look at my Facebook feed. It would be inconceivable to you that the vote would go the way it did. Yeah. And this is a total phenomenon that everybody experiences politically is. It doesn't matter what election for what event, just the way people naturally sort themselves. You are almost certainly going to find yourself in a situation where the vast majority of people you know and or follow online agree with you. And so result seems surprising. But I was not totally surprised. I was a little bit surprised, but not totally surprised because luckily for me, I have a diverse and a range of friends that I have a few friends from different parts of England to me who felt the opposite. And I would occasionally see posts from them and I'd be like, really? You really think that? And I would sometimes go clicking off down those rabbit holes into their worlds of friends. And suddenly I was seeing whole different feeds and whole different worlds where it was overwhelmingly the other way. And my way of thinking wasn't represented at all. So it was kind of a wake up call for me that hang on a second. This may well go the other way. And of course it did go the other way. And I'm really disappointed by it. And I feel a bit like a parent. It's almost like I'm not angry and just disappointed. But I am also a little bit angry about it. But I kind of feel a bit helpless about it. And I have cooled down quite a lot since the week or two after the debate. But I just think it was such a wrong-headed decision by so many people. And it's almost like I feel a bit cringy that I'm surrounded by so many people that think in a certain way that I don't think. And I respect their right. And they won the vote. So good for them. Although, funnily enough, all those people who I'm friends with who were like, let's leave, let's leave, have gone very quiet. Because I think I do think it's true that a lot of them perhaps didn't think they'd win. Or it would be different. And I think a lot of people are a bit shocked. And I've spoken to some of them. I've got a few relatives, actually. Young relatives who I spoke to and I said, after it says, you voted to leave, did you like why? And they're kind of like, I don't know. I kind of regret it now. I am saying a lot of that. And there is this sort of pervasive media story that's coming across that everyone regrets their vote. I don't actually think that's true. I think it's probably more all the people like me kind of still in our bubbles telling ourselves that everyone regrets how they voted. Yeah, I probably don't. Yeah, I completely agree. I've seen a few of those stories and I think that they are frankly, horrifically unfair anecdotal evidence. Yes, I agree. And also, wishful thinking almost certainly on the part of the people reporting them. Yes, I think there was a lot of wishful thinking going on in the fall out from the people who lost. And, you know, then they lost. But what's going to happen now kind of baffles me? I mean, as I've said before, I think personally, it's probably not that bad for me. I do a lot of my work in America. So sort of the plunging pound and the pound has immediately plunged. Yeah. And the economy has immediately started tanking. Like everyone said that wouldn't happen and it was scaremongering. Like everyone thought these countless professionals that were saying would be really bad for the economy, which is scaremongering and within sort of an hour. Yeah. The economy plunged. But you know, that's not terrible for me. I hope I actually think the people who are going to be hurt the most are probably a lot of the people who voted to leave funnily enough. But you know, the world will keep turning and everything will work out. I don't think leaving the European Union is going to look like what the people who want to leave the European Union thinks it will look like. Basically, I think we will leave the European Union. But all of the concessions and compromises and things that have to be done are going to result in a situation where everyone is unhappy. Because we have to stay in the common market and then they're not going to let us stay in the common market of Europe without the free movement of people. And it's the free movement of people that I think a lot of the leaders were against. But the free movement of people wasn't part of the referendum question. The referendum question was just should we leave the European Union. So I think we're going to leave this governmental body. But all of the compromises that are going to be necessary to preserve the UK's economy are going to result in all the leave is being unhappy anyway. I don't know. I could be wrong. I have no idea now. I just kind of, I just got to go along for the ride. Yeah, it's interesting. I'm actually kind of okay talking about Brexit now because it does feel like this is a moment after all of the passions have passed. So this morning when I knew we were going to record the podcast and we were inevitably going to talk about this topic, I was sitting down and trying to prepare for it and thinking, like what are my thoughts on this? Like now that time has passed, let me try to think about this. And the only way that I could come up with, how do I want to think about this is to be a bookmaker on the odds of what is actually going to occur. There was no other way that I could kind of think about this in a sensible way. Would you have listed is one of what I see as like three options for what can occur? Would you have described where the UK leaves the European Union, but not like a technicality, but stays in something like the EA, like the European economic area or something similar like that. I think of that as the non-exit Brexit, which is we're braggsiting, but on a total technicality that the end result of what is going to happen is that the UK just gives up a bunch of rights. It keeps free movement of people. It keeps paying into the European Union. And like from a normal citizen on the street perspective, all seems the same. Like people who live in Europe can come move to the UK, people in the UK can go move to Europe. And as we discussed on the last podcast, like immigration was a huge issue. I give the non-exit Brexit in my mind a 55% chance of happening. I think that that is the majority likelihood that this is what's going to occur. And just as you were saying, when I was writing up my notes, this to me strikes me as the most pure of a compromise, right? Because in a compromise, everyone's unhappy in some manner, right? Like that's what a compromise is. And it's like, okay, great. The pro-European people are going to be unhappy because now the UK has no say in how the European Union is governed has absolutely no levers to pull to try to institute any reforms in the European Union. And then the people who wanted to Brexit, they are going to be unhappy because this situation almost certainly addresses literally nothing that they cared about in their voting, right? But these trying to imagine and looking at the things that Brexiters were complaining about is like this addresses nothing. So I really think that that's like the 55% chance, non-exit Brexit is the thing that occurs. Everybody is unhappy to some extent. But it means that a lot of the economic concerns that we currently see happening with businesses and with the strength of the pound and investment and construction and all of this stuff in the UK. And that stuff doesn't care. Like it'll just keep trucking along as per normal with the non-exit Brexit. And it allows some of the pro-Brix at people, whether they're leaders or voters, to sort of save a bit of face. That's exactly it. It's a face-saving maneuver. Perhaps it is the worst, most self-harmoned, flicking, face-saving maneuver that has ever occurred. But it allows them to say we have achieved victory in exiting the European Union. What have you accomplished? Oh, we gave a ball of our voting rights in the EU and nothing else. That's not a good thing. It's terrible. There's one group that will claim that as a victory, and they're the people who talk about sovereignty. And I could have a lot to say about those people, but anyway, I won't. And they will say yes, but we're now the masters of our own destiny. And not only is that like a little bit deluded. Yeah. But it was really beautifully put by an article that Ben Goldacre wrote right before the vote saying that a lot of these terms that we used in the campaigning like let's be masters of our own destiny are hollow meaning the statements that you see on the cover of self-help books at airports. And what does that even mean? Now we control our own destiny. What? Like, let's take control. Like what? Believe in yourself, Britain. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. It's like there are a small number of people that if we go down this path, we'll claim yes, but now we're in control of our own destiny. Well, no, you're not. And in fact, you're probably less in control because you're still at the whims of market forces like everyone in the world, except now there's one less lever you have access to. Exactly. You know, you repay in labor. So it's a totally 1984 style. Less say is more control, right? That's what that result ends up practically being. The other kind of marking it out thing is I put that my next most probable event is at 35%. I think that literally nothing changes. That the government takes the hard line short term option of just totally ignoring the non-binding referendum of saying we're just not going to do this. And I think that option has some really, really terrible consequences. But I don't see it as an impossibility. I mean, to be clear here, I go just to get this on record. Like, while I am on the side that lost in this argument, there is no doubt that there was huge voter turnout and people voted to leave. And simply choosing to do something like ignore the referendum, like even though it was non-binding, it was not sold to people as non-binding. You're not going to be able to stand up and explain that this thing had the legal power of an opinion poll and get a happy result from people who were like, oh, okay, well, then, you know, whatever, no harm, no foul on this one. Unless it's true that everyone regrets their vote, which I don't think it is. But if that was true, everyone might just quietly put their tail between their legs and let's just pretend that never happened. There are a few cases in recent years across a whole bunch of European countries where they have had votes of the people in relation to things to do with Europe, where the will of the people has then subsequently been ignored or circumvented. Like, it's becoming an increasingly long list, but nothing quite so dramatic as a vote to leave the union altogether. And I think you're right. Ignoring it would be a big deal. But for people who don't know, to leave the European Union, a vote has to be conducted by the parliament, all the MPs in the parliament, the majority of whom don't want to leave the European Union are required to put up their hand or vote through the right lobby to say, yes, we're going to leave. So they're going to have to vote against their own will and follow the will of this referendum. And finally enough, the referendum was all about protecting the sovereignty of the UK parliament. So all of a sudden, the parliament, which we fought so hard to protect the sovereignty of, where our representatives are there deciding the future of the country, are then going to have to vote against what they want to vote. Because of a huge poll, it's an interesting dilemma. But it would be a very hard case for any MP to say, well, I didn't vote for it even though there was this result of this referendum. So it's a real, it's a real pickle. Yeah, but it's not even like, oh, it's just a real pickle. There's no way that the parliament just ignoring the referendum is anything other than anti-democratic. There's no way that that's not true. The people voted to leave. And then if parliament says, ah, forget it, we're just going to ignore this. But the people also voted all of those MPs to represent them in the parliament. The people democratically elected them to do that. Right. And that's actually where the true sovereignty of the UK lies in the parliament and in the MPs who were elected by the people. So they also have a democratic job to do to vote for things on behalf of their constituency. And I mean, we haven't got demographics for each constituency. So we don't know, they don't know what their particular people want necessarily. So there is a clash between the two forms of democracy here. And I know it's sort of, you know, splitting hairs and it's the way for the losers to get out. But it is also really legitimate concern about how this form of democracy works. Well, it is an interesting question about the nature of representative democracy. Let's assume that the majority of MPs do not think it is a good idea for their constituents if the United Kingdom leaves the European Union. It's just used it as a starting point for a conversation. Yeah. But at the same time, you have direct democracy where the people themselves have voted to leave. What is the correct decision for a moral member of parliament if they disagree with the democracy? What to do? I think there's no good way out of that. There would have been a good way out of it. I don't know if there's a possible I imagine is that what the parliament could have done was passed a law that the result of the referendum was binding before the referendum happened. But they didn't do that. And I almost think they deliberately didn't do that. This is kind of my theory about why do I think there's a 35% chance that literally nothing happens or a 55% chance of a non-exit Brexit, which leaves like an 85% chance that essentially from the average citizens perspective, nothing changes. Is that was at 90%. I don't know if I'm adding these numbers up right now. I have a feel for the proposal. That's exactly it. Listen, these numbers, they're number-ish. Maybe I mean a 45% non-exit Brexit, but whatever, 80% chance nothing happens. Just like when I try to think about the future and I'm thinking about how soon our electric car is going to come or something else that's on the horizon, how soon is genetic manipulation technology? When I try to think about what changes in the world, I think you always have to try to look at it from the perspective of things like economic demand, which I always place a lot of value on, and you have to look at the trend lines of where things are going to occur. And you also have to look at what does the current institution in power think of this and how much power do they have to accelerate or prevent this thing? And I look at the whole Brexit situation, and I can't help but think that. And one, I think that a lot of the stuff that occurred in that election was politicians probably pandering to the leave voters for their votes, partly because of the way that the UK government kind of does the first pass the post-votes splitting thing. I think a lot of the kind of prominent people who make a career on being anti-the European Union. There are a lot of people who might quite enjoy the position of being against a thing, and so of course they want the thing to continue to exist, and in their heart of hearts might recognize that it's actually better, but there's like a political niche of being the opposition. And so for example, I think with newspapers and stuff, or even with the UK government in particular, they always love to blame the EU for everything, because it means there's always someone to pass the buck onto. Right? Oh, it's never actually our fault. It's always somebody else's fault. You had a political level, there's that, and at a personal level there's blaming immigrants or people from other countries for your problems. I think that happens at a few levels. At one level you blame the bureaucrats. There's one group of people who just hate those bureaucrats in Brussels. And then there's another group of people that want to blame immigrants because they're not happy with their lot in life, and they think maybe people are taking their jobs or they're changing their culture for the worse. So there's a few different levels going on there. Yeah, there's definitely a few different levels. So what I want to be clear here is I don't think that the people who voted for Brexit were insincere, but I can say that I doubt the suspicions of a lot of the political leaders who were promoting Brexit. Like, I doubt in their heart of hearts like what did they actually really want? And what I think that they might have wanted was a close loss, right? But so that they can say, oh, you know, we fight for you, Brexit EU skeptics, we fight for you like vote for us. I think that that's their ideal outcome. And then when you add on top of that, what I think of as looking at the economic situation and we now have definite evidence that like the global market and the local economy does not like Brexit, right? This is thumbs down on Brexit, at least in the short run for what does the world economy think about this situation? And so I look at it and I say, okay, one, the people who are in power, who are in the position to actually change things, I think most of them don't want anything to change. And secondly, I think there's huge economic pressure to not change. So when I look at those two things, that's why I only put like a 10, 15% chance on Brexit in the way people who voted for Brexit think of it actually occurring. The complete withdrawal. Yeah, it would have won. Exactly, yeah, right? I think there's very little chance of that happening because the people holding the levers of power don't want it to occur. Kind of like the embodied corporations out there don't want it to occur. Like what I imagine is happening right now as we're talking is that maybe somewhere, somewhere in the government, there is a room in which politicians and prominent politicians and party backers and companies and banks are all in a room leaning a tremendous amount of pressure on some poor sod to be the scapegoat for this whole thing. We just want someone to take the fall for why Brexit isn't going to occur because all of the interests in this room don't want it to occur. Who can that be, Gray? But who can, how does that manifest itself? Well, I'm not a details man. I'm just an idea guy, right? I don't know what that looks like. It could only be like a prime minister that refuses to do it, but then they'll have to fall on their sword and then the pressure will be on the next prime minister to do it. Which is kind of what's happened. Also, there's the possibility of having an early election in the UK, which is more difficult to do, but it's still possible to do. I just think that the various powers that do not want this to occur and in a situation like this, if I have to put my money down on who is going to win this fight, the powers that I speculate do not want this to occur or the people who voted in a referendum who, again, to be clear, democratically won that it should occur. I don't put my money on the people in that scenario. I put my money on the establishment in that scenario, getting what it wants. What does super rational, Gray, think about that? Do you think that's good? Do you think that's wrong? Because at a base level, it feels wrong, doesn't it? The people, democracy, the will of the people should be. Like a super rational dude like you might think, actually, that's probably a good outcome that the people, the people don't always know what's best for them. Yeah, so I can, like this morning is the first morning I actually gave some serious thought to this. And my conclusion is that it is wrong. It is wrong for the government in this scenario to ignore the will of the people. I don't think there is any argument against that. But I am on the other side. I don't think Brexit is a good idea. And so this is a case where a thing might occur for the wrong reasons that in the long run is better, but that still doesn't really justify the like, oh, democracy. We're just going to throw it out the window right now. So the way I look at this is there are no good directions to take. I think in the long run, it's probably better for the UK to stay part of the EU. But to do that requires the government to kind of subvert its own process. And it's like, well, all we have is the process though. Like if you start walking down this road of, oh, Loss, like, you know, we use them when we like them, but we don't use them when we don't. It's like, but what's happened now? Like this is all we have to keep the world together. I mean, the legitimate way around that I guess it sounds stupid even saying it would be like a revote, like a, are you sure? Vote. Like, and then see if the same result. I know how crazy that sounds, but that would not subvert the process at least. It would be like, it could be, we want a bit more clarification and the questions could be a bit more detailed this time. And that could be used as a mechanism to withdraw the decision. If the people want to withdraw the decision, which maybe they don't, legally and technically that would possibly be one of the cleanest solutions that, like you said before, the UK says, look, we're going to have another referendum. And this one is immediately legally binding. Well, they say we're going to, we're going to keep having referendums until you've like, but that's, but that's exactly the problem though. But I like you suspect that the original referendum was written to be non-binding. And again, all of the parties, including you, Kip and the conservatives, agreed on the fact that it wasn't non-binding, which leads suspicions to me like, well, they don't want it to go the wrong way. And so that, that to me just says, well, maybe you can have another one that's legally binding, but it's just, there's no way it doesn't look awful to do that. And I was like, no, we're just going to keep voting until we get what we want. It's like, well, that's a terrible democracy. It's a terrible way to do things. I just find it very interesting that there is no good outcome. I don't know. I think it almost feels like Bayesian statistics about this to me, which is as you add additional pieces of information about a problem like it, certain unlikely probabilities seem more likely. And the reason I bring that up is because when I think about Brexit occurring, like if the UK actually leaves, I think it is very likely, like 97% likely that Scotland leaves the UK if that occurs. I find it very hard to imagine that that does not occur. Because for people who don't know who haven't been following the story, the Scottish people overwhelmingly voted to stay in the European Union. But of course, they're just part of the whole conglomerate of the UK. And all their votes were locked in with the overwhelming majority of English people and Welsh people. So if you were just taking the votes cast in Scotland alone, they did want to stay. And obviously the Scottish independence people are using that as leverage and saying, well, hang on, we don't want to leave the European Union the rest of you do. If we were independent, we wouldn't be dragged under with you. So they're going to use that to trigger there and another independence of our business. And at least from my reading of it, there was something about how the Scottish Parliament was even saying, as far as they're concerned, they've already voted to stay. So they just will stay, right? If the UK actually leaves, like we don't even need to hold another referendum. We as a nation already had a huge margin that says we're going to stay. So then they're going to definitely get their own approach. And then they will, because they'll be top level sovereignty, right? It's very clear. That could be the deciding factor. Scotland, you have your own emoji, right? Then Scotland's going to be wishing that the UK leaves, they can get their emoji. That's how people make decisions in these things. But so when I think about that, I really do think that it's almost impossible to imagine a scenario where Scotland doesn't leave the UK if the UK leaves the EU. And then if that occurs, I also think it starts getting into the realm of like, not crazy unlikely that Northern Ireland, which also voted to stay, might leave the UK. Because then like Northern Ireland would be making a decision in the perspective of, do you want to leave the European Union with England and Wales alone? Right? Like that's a very different question, all of a sudden. Then we're really looking at Brexit might lead to the breakup of the United Kingdom, which I think is a thing that's kind of on people's minds now as a possibility that might occur. And so when I say it's like, it's like Bayesian in a way, it's almost like if the UK were to have another referendum, that piece of information plus the piece of information that the international markets obviously don't like the idea of Brexit, I think that really changes the idea of what are you voting for. Possibly just Wales and England to leave the EU. That sounds like a terrible idea. Like I don't think very many people would vote for that if it was on the referendum, but it may very well be the logical consequence of the referendum. Yeah, I think you're right, Gray. There's a few other things that I feel the thoughts that I had. One thing that I think is important to say, because it's a really important thing in what's going on in politics in a few things, is that I don't think most of the people who voted to leave are idiots. Right. Like I think they made a poor decision for whatever reasons they made it, but I don't think they're idiots. But I think that has been the pervasive message. If you vote to leave, you're an idiot. And that was kind of the intellectual highbrow sort of attitude that was coming across and the build up to the election. And I think that was really, really counterproductive. And I think it makes people who are 50-50, but leaning or maybe people who have a slight leaning towards leave. I just think it entranches their position. Telling people their idiots is bad. And I think it became a really big part of this election. That people who maybe have a lower income or come from a part of England that is poorer felt like they were being told they were idiots for having their doubts about Europe. And I think that caused a real backlash. And fair enough, too. You shouldn't tell people their idiots. I totally agree. I mean, this goes back to my whole feeling about how groups just talk with themselves and they end up creating these imaginary versions of the other group that they just rail against. How does that change anybody's mind? I think that just is the same thing. It further makes people feel resentful and trench into their positions. It's not a mind-changing thing to describe someone as an idiot. I mean, so you should change your mind and vote for me. It's not a good argument. It's not a good way to change someone's actual mind. Tell you what else I've done, Gray. What? I've started the process of applying for my Irish passport. Have you really? Yep. So I can say that you're paying unions, too. Are you able to get an Irish passport? I am. I am. So I've gotten Australian one and I've got a UK one, but I am eligible for an Irish one. So I could end up with three passports. I always forget that you have the UK passport. I don't know why I can't remember that. I was thinking like, oh, but buddy, if you get the Irish passport just like me, you can stay in the UK anyway. You don't have to go travel to the UK or be in union. But if I do want to keep the option of being able to live and work anywhere in the EU. I think it's a stupid thing and I don't really need to do it, but it was just something I did on impulse. But I'm not the lone ranger. The Irish authorities have actually issued a plea to the people that are Britain to stop applying for Irish passports because they're doing absolutely overwhelmed at the moment. Oh my God, I'm not surprised. I'm not the least bit surprised that Ireland must be getting swamped with passport applications. So there you go. I'm currently gathering all the necessary birth certificates and things like that. Well, I wish you all the best of luck in your Irish endeavors. It could be a long way by the sounds of it.",
