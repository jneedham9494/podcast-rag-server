## Recommendations by Podcast Type

### Interview-Based Podcasts (Priority for Patterns)
Already excellent extraction:
- ✅ Adam Buxton (100%)
- ✅ Louis Theroux (93.2%)
- ✅ RHLSTP (89.7%)
- ✅ Grounded (86.4%)

Could improve with more patterns:
- 🟡 Odd Lots (61.4%) - Title-based extraction may work better
- 🟡 Joshua Citarella (39.0%) - More format variations needed
- 🟡 Chapo Trap House (38.8%) - "feat." patterns need enhancement

### Narrative/Documentary Podcasts
Not optimized for traditional guest extraction:
- Blowback, The Missing Cryptoqueen, Witch, Things Fell Apart
- These are storytelling podcasts without traditional interviews

### Co-Host/Panel Podcasts
Don't have single-guest format:
- Cox n' Crendor Show, Hello Internet
- These are ongoing conversations between hosts

### Solo Content Podcasts
Minimal or no guest interviews:
- Monday Morning Podcast, Jimquisition
- Primarily solo host content

---

## Overall System Performance

### Strengths:
✅ **Perfect extraction for priority podcast** (Adam Buxton)
✅ **90%+ extraction for Louis Theroux**
✅ **Accurate tagging** of 153 non-guest episodes
✅ **1,794 unique guests** extracted
✅ **Podcast-specific patterns** for major shows

### Areas for Improvement:
🟡 Sports podcasts (Arseblog) - irregular naming
🟡 Political commentary (Chapo, True Anon) - inconsistent formats
🟡 Documentary/narrative shows - not interview-based
🟡 Solo content identification - to exclude from guest extraction

---

## Conclusion

The guest extraction system achieves:
- **100% extraction for priority podcasts** (Adam Buxton)
- **85-95% extraction for major interview podcasts** (Louis Theroux, RHLSTP, Grounded)
- **Accurate non-guest episode tagging** (153 episodes)
- **Realistic performance expectations** based on podcast format

The system is **production-ready** for analyzing interview-based podcasts and extracting book/movie/music recommendations from guest conversations.
