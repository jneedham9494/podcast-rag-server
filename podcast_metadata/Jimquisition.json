A 1999 movie that looks like it was made in the 1980s, featuring a plot that makes no sense, a lack of antagonists, and the worst space navy in the universe, it's one of those films that might have been entertainingly bad if it wasn't just plain bad. \n\nAnyway, your Movie Boys try and make it interesting for you.",
