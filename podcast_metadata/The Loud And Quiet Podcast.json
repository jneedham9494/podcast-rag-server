Things slowly grew, but 2023 was a supercharged year for the band when their forth album, <em>Rat Saw God</em>, became the year’s indie hit for all fans of indie- folk- and Southern-rock.</p><p>Next month the band will release the even better <em>Bleeds</em>. A strange album for Hartzman and guitarist Jake ‘MJ’ Lenderman, it was written in the final months of their romantic relationship and recorded post-breakup. They agreed to keep their split from the band until <em>Bleeds</em> was recorded. Following a year of huge solo success in 2024, Lenderman remains a member of Wednesday when they’re in the studio, but will no longer tour with them.</p><p>On this episode of the podcast – recorded in London last week – we discuss the split in the background of the band’s new album, how Karly has kicked social media with the help of a s**t phone, death by bears, and how Wednesday’s next album might be a hardcore punk record.</p><p>Listen above or via your podcast app of choice.</p><p><strong>Further links and videos:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://www.prisondivorcebombshell.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Karly’s weird and wonderful website</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.wednesday.band/\" target=\"_blank\">Wednesday’s website</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWA7GtDmNFU\" target=\"_blank\">Grizzly Man trailer</a></p>",

What did he make of those days, and how does he feel about returning to music as an independent artist in a new world of hyper-self-marketing and content creation? </p><p>And then there was the question of new album <em>Crying the Neck</em>, Wolf’s first album in 13 years, and a punchy closer: is he happy with his career so far?

Each episode features a different artist recalling what the hell they were doing at the age of 16, inspired by a column of hopes, dreams and PTSD we used to run in the magazine. Somewhere along the line 2 episodes dropped off, hosted somewhere else for reasons that are too boring even for this. One was with Stephen Malkmus and the other was with Amy Taylor from Australian garage punk band <strong>Amyl & the Sniffers</strong>. It’s time these 2 stragglers were united with the rest of the pack, so here’s Amy’s episode, with a bit of extra blabbing from me.</p>",

Followed shortly by, ‘what was Dana Margolin’s career highlight?’, and ‘should more bands split up at a point when their fans feel like they’ve still got more to give?’</p><p>Last week Dana agreed to talk to me about the end of her band, having originally decided that it was too soon to discuss the matter. </p>",
