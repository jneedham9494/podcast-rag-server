Is it horror or literary fiction? is it important for people writing about dark subjects to have three names? What attracted&nbsp;Andrew&nbsp;to writing about dilapidated seaside resorts - and has he ever been to Weston-super-Mare? How does he make his novels so atmospheric? What’s it like getting a quote from Stephen King? Plus&nbsp;Andrew’s remarkable leap to success (after only ten years of work) and how a 300 book print run led to a hugely successful first novel, Richard reveals how little he knows about Gothic novels (or what they even are), how we are all haunted by the mistakes we've made in life and how the contemplation of our own mortality can drive so much of our lives.

Also how many Bob Mortimers might there be out there and why his book imagines an alternate world for him?</p><br /><p>Bob has also brought along his joke book for emergencies.</p><br /><p>Buy Bob’s excellent book here -&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Audible-The-Satsuma-Complex/dp/B0B5YBZP5J/ref=sr_1_2?crid=E2DTJXUHI5SL&amp;keywords=bob+mortimer&amp;qid=1664270408&amp;qu=eyJxc2MiOiIzLjgyIiwicXNhIjoiMy4wMyIsInFzcCI6IjIuODkifQ==&amp;sprefix=bob+mortimer,aps,92&amp;sr=8-2\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.amazon.co.uk/Audible-The-Satsuma-Complex/dp/B0B5YBZP5J</a></p><br /><p><strong>SUPPORT THE SHOW!</strong></p><p><strong>Watch our </strong><a href=\"https://open.acast.com/shows/61ba0fda1a8cbe093a3cf14b/episodes/61c493cb56400000142f487e/twitch.tv/rkherring\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">TWITCH CHANNEL</a></p><p><strong>Become a badger and see extra content&nbsp;at our </strong><a href=\"https://open.acast.com/shows/61ba0fda1a8cbe093a3cf14b/episodes/61c493cb56400000142f487e/rhlstp.co.uk\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WEBSITE </a></p><p><strong>See details of the </strong><a href=\"https://open.acast.com/shows/61ba0fda1a8cbe093a3cf14b/episodes/61c493cb56400000142f487e/richardherring.com/gigs\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">RHLSTP TOUR DATES </a></p><p><strong>Buy DVDs and books from </strong><a href=\"https://open.acast.com/shows/61ba0fda1a8cbe093a3cf14b/episodes/61c493cb56400000142f487e/gofasterstripe.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">GO FASTER STRIPE</a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

Once we’ve over that hill, it’s plain sailing as they discuss how much the world has changed in the last few decades, the ethics of sending an 8 year old to boarding school, the glory days of journalism and mental illness. Is Richard still in a dream that started 25 years ago? How much research goes into a book like Birdsong? What is the motivation for writing books continuing the stories of James Bond and Jeeves and Wooster (not in the same books!)? Plus a discussion of 20th century toilet paper.</p><br /><p>Sebastian Faulks is the author of Fires Which Burned Brightly: A Life in Progress (Hutchinson Heinemann £20, out now).

They talk about her fantastic new independent film, Sunlight, how it’s a dark love story about a suicidal man, a woman in a monkey suit and an attempt to dig up a grave to recover a $20,000 dollar watch, but so much more than that. How the idea and the real life love began in the middle of a 50 hour improv session, the dangers of going under water in a monkey suit, how the film might appeal to Furries, how it could never be written by AI and why you should definitely see it. Plus how Nina ended up in Spinal Tap 2 and a good indication of why Richard didn’t, how ventriloquist dummies become their own people (or monkeys), the dark past of ventriloquists and whether Nina resents her monkey.</p><br /><p>Nina's directorial debut film 'Sunlight' will have a UK theatrical release from 18th October 2025 (screening details&nbsp;<a href=\"https://theninaconti.komi.io/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>), or you can pre-order it on Apple TV&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tv.apple.com/gb/movie/sunlight/umc.cmc.4ojx0r3x4tbpiz2huixkm32ie\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>&nbsp;(UK) and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tv.apple.com/ie/movie/sunlight/umc.cmc.4ojx0r3x4tbpiz2huixkm32ie\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>&nbsp;(Ireland)&nbsp;- available digitally from 28th November 2025.</p><br /><p>Nina Conti has a UK tour extension of her hit live show 'Whose Face Is It Anyway?' from 30th September - 30th October 2025.

They talk about the girl who smelled of spam and&nbsp;Sally’s impressive performance in the film “How To Please A Woman”, but they can’t avoid the elephant in the room and discuss there somewhat different memories of the break up of their relationship (and at least one of hers confuses a sketch with reality, but what is truth?) and how this impacted on their Edinburgh shows (and lives).</p><br /><p>Can they reach a place of forgiveness for their behaviour?

      "description": "<p><strong>RHLSTP Book Club #154 - Entitled -</strong> Richard talks to Andrew Lownie about his meticulous and explosive book about Prince Andrew, Sarah Ferguson and more, Entitled. They chat about the process of getting this book to print and the surprises and revelations that are sometimes quite casually dropped in, how it’s easy to feel sorry for Andrew for his bizarre childhood where he had no boundaries, but harder to feel sorry for him when you read all the stupid, selfish and criminal things he has done as an adult. Also the scandalous grifting and Romanov style spending and waste, the Epstein files and the many reasons why more of the victims have not come forward, how easy it is to discover the lies that Andrew has told and the truth about the famous photo, whether Andrew lives in fear after writing a book like this, whether the monarchy can survive this scandal and how much more there is to come out. Also what it says about the way business is run in the world and the utter stupidity and depravity of so many (usually men) in important positions who didn’t seem to realise that they were being trapped and could be blackmailed. Also the truth behind the Newsnight interview and who really did the work for it and how Andrew was stupid enough to think it had gone well. Plus the many instances where he found himself able to sweat.</p><br /><p>This is an extraordinary book which you really should read.</p><p>Buy it here - <a href=\"https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/entitled-the-rise-and-fall-of-the-house-of-york-andrew-lownie/b66b23561541b2d1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/entitled-the-rise-and-fall-of-the-house-of-york-andrew-lownie/b66b23561541b2d1</a></p><br /><p><strong>SUPPORT THE SHOW!</strong></p><p><strong>Watch our </strong><a href=\"https://open.acast.com/shows/61ba0fda1a8cbe093a3cf14b/episodes/61c493cb56400000142f487e/twitch.tv/rkherring\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">TWITCH CHANNEL</a></p><p><strong>Become a badger and see extra content&nbsp;at our </strong><a href=\"https://open.acast.com/shows/61ba0fda1a8cbe093a3cf14b/episodes/61c493cb56400000142f487e/rhlstp.co.uk\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WEBSITE </a></p><p><strong>See details of the </strong><a href=\"https://open.acast.com/shows/61ba0fda1a8cbe093a3cf14b/episodes/61c493cb56400000142f487e/richardherring.com/gigs\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">RHLSTP TOUR DATES </a></p><p><strong>Buy DVDs and books from </strong><a href=\"https://open.acast.com/shows/61ba0fda1a8cbe093a3cf14b/episodes/61c493cb56400000142f487e/gofasterstripe.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">GO FASTER STRIPE</a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

They discuss how the book came together, where&nbsp;the jokes came from, the decision to make some of them very slow burners for younger readers, how telling and making up jokes can bond a family and the cohost chooses some of his favourites as well as trying out a rude one of his own. It’s anarchic and unpredictable, just like the book, which is tremendous fun.</p><br /><p>Buy the book here <a href=\"https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/a-poo-on-a-pogo-stick-the-funniest-joke-book-ever-olaf-falafel/7851240\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/a-poo-on-a-pogo-stick-the-funniest-joke-book-ever-olaf-falafel/7851240</a></p><br /><p><strong>SUPPORT THE SHOW!</strong></p><p><strong>Watch our </strong><a href=\"https://open.acast.com/shows/61ba0fda1a8cbe093a3cf14b/episodes/61c493cb56400000142f487e/twitch.tv/rkherring\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">TWITCH CHANNEL</a></p><p><strong>Become a badger and see extra content&nbsp;at our </strong><a href=\"https://open.acast.com/shows/61ba0fda1a8cbe093a3cf14b/episodes/61c493cb56400000142f487e/rhlstp.co.uk\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WEBSITE </a></p><p><strong>See details of the </strong><a href=\"https://open.acast.com/shows/61ba0fda1a8cbe093a3cf14b/episodes/61c493cb56400000142f487e/richardherring.com/gigs\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">RHLSTP TOUR DATES </a></p><p><strong>Buy DVDs and books from </strong><a href=\"https://open.acast.com/shows/61ba0fda1a8cbe093a3cf14b/episodes/61c493cb56400000142f487e/gofasterstripe.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">GO FASTER STRIPE</a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

They chat about being locked out of flats, broken cat-flaps, the year of the Herring and how much O2 paid to sponsor RHLSTP (in the golden era),&nbsp;Tim’s appearance in the new Greg Daniels sitcom The Paper and Robert Popper’s part in getting him there, 5k times and the pathetic money-making crimes that Richard never got caught for in 1989 (if you were one of the students he took to HMS Victory please get in touch for your rebate).

Richard is still talking (though mainly listening) to comedy legend&nbsp;Bernie&nbsp;Clifton. Finally we’re getting to&nbsp;Bernie’s TV career and cultural references that might be understood by anyone under 85. Remember that&nbsp;Bernie&nbsp;is 89 years old and this podcast (along with last week’s) was recorded all in one go. And I reckon he had another two hours in him if we didn’t have to go home. He talks about his appearances on Crown Court, singing XTC songs on Crackerjack, how he survived the wave of alternative comedy that scuppered some of his contemporaries,&nbsp;how he ended up on The Voice and returned to his first love of singing and who his biggest comedy hero was. There’s more mayhem and poetry and not enough time to talk about any of the things Richard wanted to. But man, what a beautiful, joyful, amazing man and what a phenomenal memory (and bladder).</p><br /><p>Come and see RHLSTP live&nbsp;<a href=\"http://richardherring.com/rhlstp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://richardherring.com/rhlstp</a></p><p>Do yourself a favour and buy&nbsp;Bernie’s Book here - <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Crackerjack-Vegas-Bernie-Clifton/dp/1909813974\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.amazon.co.uk/Crackerjack-Vegas-Bernie-Clifton/dp/1909813974</a></p><br /><p><strong>SUPPORT THE SHOW!</strong></p><p><strong>Watch our </strong><a href=\"https://open.acast.com/shows/61ba0fda1a8cbe093a3cf14b/episodes/61c493cb56400000142f487e/twitch.tv/rkherring\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">TWITCH CHANNEL</a></p><p><strong>Become a badger and see extra content&nbsp;at our </strong><a href=\"https://open.acast.com/shows/61ba0fda1a8cbe093a3cf14b/episodes/61c493cb56400000142f487e/rhlstp.co.uk\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WEBSITE </a></p><p><strong>See details of the </strong><a href=\"https://open.acast.com/shows/61ba0fda1a8cbe093a3cf14b/episodes/61c493cb56400000142f487e/richardherring.com/gigs\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">RHLSTP LIVE DATES </a></p><p><strong>Buy DVDs and books from </strong><a href=\"https://open.acast.com/shows/61ba0fda1a8cbe093a3cf14b/episodes/61c493cb56400000142f487e/gofasterstripe.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">GO FASTER STRIPE</a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

There’s some great chat about changing attitudes to individuality, plus the comedic process, how surreal comedy is a rare skill and staying true to yourself, plus Andrew having to do a 90s style Edinburgh show because they broke their leg and have been on morphine, playing Jongleurs without compromising your act, the joy of connecting with one (and only one) audience member and how it’s disappointing that TV just doesn’t take a punt on interesting comedians any more.</p><br /><p>See Andrew’s stand up show Escape here <a href=\"https://www.edfringe.com/tickets/whats-on/andrew-o-neill-escape\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.edfringe.com/tickets/whats-on/andrew-o-neill-escape</a></p><p>See Andrew’s History of Punk (but only if you like punk) here <a href=\"https://www.edfringe.com/tickets/whats-on/andrew-o-neill-s-history-of-punk\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.edfringe.com/tickets/whats-on/andrew-o-neill-s-history-of-punk</a></p><p>See RHLSTP live in Bewdley (and maybe elsewhere)&nbsp;<a href=\"http://richardherring.com/rhlstp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://richardherring.com/rhlstp</a></p><br /><p><strong>SUPPORT THE SHOW!</strong></p><p><strong>Watch our </strong><a href=\"https://open.acast.com/shows/61ba0fda1a8cbe093a3cf14b/episodes/61c493cb56400000142f487e/twitch.tv/rkherring\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">TWITCH CHANNEL</a></p><p><strong>Become a badger and see extra content&nbsp;at our </strong><a href=\"https://open.acast.com/shows/61ba0fda1a8cbe093a3cf14b/episodes/61c493cb56400000142f487e/rhlstp.co.uk\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WEBSITE </a></p><p><strong>See details of the </strong><a href=\"https://open.acast.com/shows/61ba0fda1a8cbe093a3cf14b/episodes/61c493cb56400000142f487e/richardherring.com/gigs\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">RHLSTP LIVE DATES </a></p><p><strong>Buy DVDs and books from </strong><a href=\"https://open.acast.com/shows/61ba0fda1a8cbe093a3cf14b/episodes/61c493cb56400000142f487e/gofasterstripe.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">GO FASTER STRIPE</a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

His guest is the extraordinary Deborah Frances-White.&nbsp;They talk about whether Dracula was ever young, but the podcast is mainly about the major decisions Deborah had made in her personal life and the way she has chosen to deal with the traumas of her past. She talks about what having an open marriage means for her and how she has reset her brain with the help of a Peruvian shaman. This might not be the way forward for everyone, but she talks openly and honestly about her spiritual experiences. Plus there’s an impromptu charity auction.

George does most of the talking, which is probably for the best and reveals what he considers to the be the starting point of capitalism, why capitalism and commerce are not the same thing, the roots of Neo Liberalism in the closing stages of World War II, why it took 30 years to come to prominence, conspiracy theories versus conspiracy fictions, why the left has missed opportunities to defeat&nbsp;Neo-liberalism, what happened when Liz Truss tried to institute its policies all in one go, why Starmer is wrong to try and legitimise Reform and whether there is hope for the future and what we can do to stand up to a political system that threatens our planet.

With Isma he discusses how it's possible to tick too many boxes, performing in a burkha, why comedy is the perfect job if you hate working and they hatch a foolproof plan to get back at their critics.. Tony chats about his career and the factors that led to its implosion, how much coke he might have been taking a week, Kenneth Branagh's campness, the harshness of an industry that loves you when you're winning and the lessons he has learned.

Although Chris says it’s not Top Trumps his cancer makes Richard’s look like a paper cut and the book is bold and matter of fact about the impact of a non-sugar coated stage 4 cancer diagnosis, but whilst acknowledging the spiral of grief that this inevitably caused, Chris discusses the catharsis of writing about it, applying sports psychology to the situation and seeing the positives of life rather than constantly worrying about death, which could come to any of us at any time. He talks about his own particular deeply unpleasant chemotherapy and the reasons he endured it and how he got through it, how comedy can help us through and how he hopes he might be around for a while yet. Plus how he coped with life after the Olympic victory and trying to avoid Alan Partridgisms. And how making the most of life isn’t just about bucket lists, but realising what matters in your life and how lucky we are to be here.

Should Richard with his 2:1 in history have know about more of them than he does? Perhaps. They chat about why women (and non-royalty generally) are so badly represented in history, how history is more fun if you’re allowed to be judgemental about the clearly horrible stuff, how even stories from as recently at the 60s show how pervasive certain ideas of women can be, how Eleanor chose her 18 people/groups to write about and how the book is more serious than one might have expected (but still has plenty of funny stuff in it too).</p><br /><p>Buy the book here</p><p><a href=\"https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/life-lessons-from-historical-women-eleanor-morton/7670509?ean=9781804192276\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/life-lessons-from-historical-women-eleanor-morton/7670509?ean=9781804192276</a></p><br /><p>See RHLSTP recorded live - <a href=\"https://richardherring.com/rhlstp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://richardherring.com/rhlstp</a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

Rich was too scared to talk to him when he saw him improbably travelling on London's tube, but hopefully he won't just sit quietly, staring at him and saying nothing this time. The pair discuss Harry's career which seems to break the space-time continuum as he's worked with such legends as Abbott and Costello, Jack Benny and Mel Blanc. Why does Derek Smalls wrap his courgette in tin foil and what's his affiliation with Shrewsbury Town? How much creative control do the actors on the Simpsons have over the characters they have helped create? Is stubbornness a pro or a con when trying to make it in show business? What is the Jerry Lewis film, \"The Day The Clown Cried\" really like? Will we hear from Simpson's character Hugh Jass? It's an amazing interview with a driven and hilarious genius man. And Harry Shearer is in it too.</p><br /><p>Come and see the new show on tour - <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqa0UxNzBWVXZ6Nlk2RU5xRjQxMnl4ejRFM1hUQXxBQ3Jtc0ttRmhyWlZBVS04bmhJZlJCRi1SYVJaRjFCWEUzRWYzOTdNdHgwNE9wcHJLaW5kSW1iMnFtRzdueVZwM2RGLTU2RVVOWGoydEdxaUViRWNPMlBoWnFaX2ZESkpyRThuQlo4Y1VfaVlLZG1tcTI0N1U3WQ&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Frichardherring.com%2Fballback%2Ftour&amp;v=_oIoBhKKNx8\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://richardherring.com/ballback/tour</a></p><br /><p><strong>SUPPORT THE SHOW!</strong></p><p>Check out our website&nbsp;<a href=\"http://rhlstp.co.uk/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://rhlstp.co.uk</a></p><p>See details of the RHLSTP tour dates&nbsp;<a href=\"http://richardherring.com/gigs\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://richardherring.com/gigs</a></p><p>Buy DVDs and Books at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://gofasterstripe.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://gofasterstripe.com</a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

He's certainly met his match in pedantry and both men accidentally reveal some shocking details about their respective psyches. Never have two men discussed at such length the vagaries of choosing between a ham hand and a sun lotion arm pit. And that is GUARANTEED. The Peep Show stationery cupboard, romantic subterfuge and the Daily Mail readers' internet comments are all up for discussion and we'll find out how an early discussion about Eric Morecambe almost brought the pair to blows. Did Rich really meet some Shreks and a Justin Lee Collins in the street? And what was Tim from The Office like before he became Tim from The Office? Is Richard as bitter and mean as he seems and will he ever get a Googlewhack audience? What's it like to play Aerosmith at table tennis? Will Rich ever forgive his mum for her Brideshead Revisited Alfresco trump? Why don't the audience understand any of Richard's obscure 1980s references? What would you do if God granted you the power of having exactly the same hands as Hermione from Harry Potter? And just how many David Mitchells are there anyway? It's a marathon of a podcast, but there's no cheating and we both stay in it for the whole thing. It'd be nice if there was a happy ending. But there's a slightly unhappy ending. See if you can make it to the ending.</p><br /><p>Come and see the new show on tour - <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqa0UxNzBWVXZ6Nlk2RU5xRjQxMnl4ejRFM1hUQXxBQ3Jtc0ttRmhyWlZBVS04bmhJZlJCRi1SYVJaRjFCWEUzRWYzOTdNdHgwNE9wcHJLaW5kSW1iMnFtRzdueVZwM2RGLTU2RVVOWGoydEdxaUViRWNPMlBoWnFaX2ZESkpyRThuQlo4Y1VfaVlLZG1tcTI0N1U3WQ&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Frichardherring.com%2Fballback%2Ftour&amp;v=_oIoBhKKNx8\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://richardherring.com/ballback/tour</a></p><br /><p><strong>SUPPORT THE SHOW!</strong></p><p>Check out our website&nbsp;<a href=\"http://rhlstp.co.uk/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://rhlstp.co.uk</a></p><p>See details of the RHLSTP tour dates&nbsp;<a href=\"http://richardherring.com/gigs\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://richardherring.com/gigs</a></p><p>Buy DVDs and Books at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://gofasterstripe.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://gofasterstripe.com</a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

Will Osman realise where he's gone wrong with his TV shows and finally commission Richard to write and sing the theme tune? Will Pointless ever take the money and head to Channel 4? What will Osman say about Rich's mum this time? Why can't chocolate manufacturer's put aside their differences? How big is a glass? Is it OK to propose to someone over Twitter?

It’s an unbelievable and remarkable true story which has much to tell us about our history and the present day. David talks about what it’s like to work on a book that goes on to be an Oscar Nominated move, Killers of the Flower Moon and how he discovered the largely forgotten story of The&nbsp;Wager, the meticulous research required to create a book like this and how to deal with conflicting accounts of the same story. Also the surprisingly&nbsp;horrendous effect of scurvy, the difficulty of persuading men to become sailors at a time when death seemed almost inevitable, the class divisions and racism that made the crew of The&nbsp;Wager’s nightmare voyage even more nightmarish, how a cut off ear was the impetus for all of this madness and David’s slightly insane trip to visit&nbsp;Wager&nbsp;Island and why it was worthwhile.

Are Scaffolders really the craziest of all the tradesmen? Are footballers good at anything other than football? What if Paddington was 6ft 7 and from Croydon? How healthy is Romesh Ranaganathan's poo? And how badly can you mess up a chance to play a Biblical figure in a movie? There's also another addition to the forthcoming volume, 'Stories about meeting Brian Blessed'.</p><br /><p><strong>SUPPORT THE SHOW!</strong></p><p>Check out our website&nbsp;<a href=\"http://rhlstp.co.uk/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://rhlstp.co.uk</a></p><p>See details of the RHLSTP tour dates&nbsp;<a href=\"http://richardherring.com/gigs\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://richardherring.com/gigs</a></p><p>Buy DVDs and Books at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://gofasterstripe.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://gofasterstripe.com</a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

Starstruck and clearly in disbelieving awe, Rich flounders around and mainly embarrasses himself, but luckily Mr Cross is able to come up with some amazing riffed comedy about frozen vegetables, Abraham and taking cocaine near President Obama, whilst getting a bit more serious about Donald Trump, the responsibilities of fatherhood, why Richard should probably not take hard drugs, the benefits of the middle-aged sketch show and David’s part in the creation of kickstarter. </p><br /><p>Richard hoped that he would so impress David that they would become good friends and could appear in Doctor Doolittle 3 together as method-acted monkeys, but I think it’s safe to say that that will not happen. Cross put away an impressive amount of bitter during this podcast and still remains focused and coherent, but clearly needed the toilet near the end, which turns into a battle of the obstinately pedantic 1990s underrated sketch show stars.</p><br /><p><strong>SUPPORT THE SHOW!</strong></p><p>Check out our website&nbsp;<a href=\"http://rhlstp.co.uk/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://rhlstp.co.uk</a></p><p>See details of the RHLSTP tour dates&nbsp;<a href=\"http://richardherring.com/gigs\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://richardherring.com/gigs</a></p><p>Buy DVDs and Books at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://gofasterstripe.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://gofasterstripe.com</a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

Alas he gets distracted into discussing aversion to non-binding cheese; how thunder storms are the UK's biggest killer; advertising pear cider, and the criticisms that engendered; and Watson's love of dry stone-walling. Richard continues to try and pinpoint where having sex with a machine counts as infidelity and tries to encourage Mark to enact some of his fans' sexual fantasies.

It'd be a shame to have Britain's most exciting film director on the show without wasting most of the time talking about this and the obscure and sexist Roald Dahl short story - Switch Bitch. And Richard hates to disappoint. Luckily he occasionally manages to blunder into discussing Wright's canon of work, from A Fistful of Fingers through Asylum, some ideas for a new series of Spaced, right up to the amazing new film The World's End. But there's still time to talk about what it's like to be taught by both parents, desecrating the graves of your former employers and Rich's ideas to reboot Goodnight Sweetheart and We Will Rock You before Edgar has to dash off to finish off his new film.

Why are the things we know about kings of this period nearly all made up?

How do you tour and celebrate Christmas in a war? It’s an incredible story from a very eloquent man speaking in a second language (where school lessons did not prepare him for talking about war).

Is it possible to generalise about a whole sex? And more importantly is it funny? Is size important (both penis and height in general)? Can you beat a chimp in hand to hand combat? Are women as deluded about their tennis skills as men? Why don’t men check their junk more regularly? Under what circumstances is it OK for men to cry?&nbsp;Rich is happy to hear a new (to him) euphemism for a scared penis and they discuss the surprising crossovers with Caitlin Moran’s latest book, which give Geoff a good idea for his next one.</p><br /><p>Geoff's Book is here - <a href=\"https://www.hive.co.uk/Product/Geoff-Norcott/The-British-Bloke-Decoded--From-Banter-to-Man-Flu-Everyth/28776287\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.hive.co.uk/Product/Geoff-Norcott/The-British-Bloke-Decoded--From-Banter-to-Man-Flu-Everyth/28776287</a></p><br /><p>The RHLSTP tour continues&nbsp;<a href=\"http://richardherring.com/rhlstp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://richardherring.com/rhlstp</a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

His guest is Nicole Kidman impersonator and fantastically thoughtful yet and puerile stand-up Sarah Kendall, fresh from her nomination for the big comedy award at the Fringe. They discuss the horrors of child birth, the redundancy of the hand job, growing up in New Newcastle, how audiences can sometimes laugh in the wrong way, the plot holes in Back To The Future, loads of stuff about cocks and vaginas (obviously), the inevitability of nuclear destruction, plus some surprisingly serious bits about the nature of being a stand-up. To be honest, most of the time we forgot that we weren't sitting in the lounge in our Edinburgh flat having the kind of conversations with one another that are totally unacceptable in the actual world.

They discuss getting older, being 60, Richard’s eerily accurate prediction about the kindle, what you do with dead bodies at sea, how many mates you need on a yacht, the improv course where Pete rubbed shoulders with some of UK comedy’s future greats, how he managed to literally back out of sports at school, losing an Oscar in a train station, how Carry On and Weird Science gave a poor example of sexual relations and some somewhat disappointing accommodation. Plus Monsters in the attic, being followed by a rhino and Richard’s glasses break, giving him an incredible new gimmick.

He always wears a suit. There’s nothing unusual going on. His guest is just some guy from some old sketch show and the first Knight (that says Ni) on the podcast, Sir Michael Palin. </p><br /><p>Obviously Rich is in awe and on his best behaviour, but that won’t stop him bringing up one of Michael’s rare career disappointments and nearly derailing everything. But Michael is everything you’d hope for and you can find out what he got paid for his script being used in Sliding Doors, how the Fish Dance went down in North Korea, how Life of Brian might have been Python at its height, the perils of being a mud eater, how Mrs Palin ended up on Saturday Night Live, why Terry Jones was the heart of Python and how this remarkable friendship between writing partners was maintained right to the end. Plus the best impression of Cicero that you’re likely to hear.  Will Richard end up in the diary and what terrible things will be said about him…? We will have to wait.</p><br /><p>Monthly badgers - your backstage interview includes Michael ad-libbing a brand new scene for Life of Brian which I would say is worth your monthly subscription to the end of time.

This week he’s asking if comedians and celebrities would prefer to date a man who was a six foot tall penis or a man who, instead of having a penis has a tiny man down there. It produces some surprising answers from guests including Katherine Ryan, James Acaster, Sarah Millican, Ben Goldacre and Mary Lynn Rajskub. And the amazing thing is it’s like none of them had ever been asked this question before.</p><br /><p><br /></p><p><strong>SUPPORT THE SHOW!</strong></p><p><strong>Come and see us live</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.richardherring.com/rhlstpt/tour\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">GIGS</a></p><p><strong>Watch our </strong><a href=\"https://twitch.tv/rkherring\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">TWITCH CHANNEL</a></p><p><strong>See extra content&nbsp;at our </strong><a href=\"https://rhlstp.co.uk/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WEBSITE</a></p><br /><p><br /></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

They are chatting about his new Audible audiobook/podcast Debutante, a deep dive into the extraordinary life of Carol Howe, the former debutante who became a Neo-Nazi and then an informant and then… well who can be sure? It’s a fascinating and often harrowing investigation into whether the Oklahoma bombing might have been prevented, who might have been involved and the often compelling conspiracy theories that have sprung up. Rich and Jon discuss how he copes with the dangers he puts himself in, the fight between rival strippers that provided a possible clue to whether Timothy Mcveigh was a lone wolf, the importance of keeping a sense of balance and not going down the rabbit hole, how Jon is the Simon Cowell of investigative journalism and whether, as middle aged men, Richard and Jon are in danger of getting obsessed with some mad theory and ruining their lives.

Richard talks to Evie King (if that is her real name) about her new book about her council job of organising funerals for people who don’t have the means to pay for them. It’s a surprisingly affecting story about a woman doing a job you’ve never thought about, much more fastidiously and empathetically than is required and a celebration of life and a treatise on death, as well as being full of intrigue, mystery and humour. They discuss why murderers haven’t thought it through, how even those who have done bad things deserve a dignified send off, why you need a strong stomach for this job and how your life can be affected and changed by someone who you never met, who is no longer alive. It’s a strong recommend for this excellent book which hopefully will one day be a TV series. But who will play Evie? And who will play the dead suspected paedo? (Yeah, the second question is easier to answer than the first).</p><br /><p>https://www.lovereading.co.uk/book/9781915306302/isbn/Ashes-To-Admin-Tales-from-the-Caseload-of-a-Council-Funeral-Officer-by-Evie-King.html</p><br /><p><strong>SUPPORT THE SHOW!</strong></p><p><strong>Watch our </strong><a href=\"https://twitch.tv/rkherring\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">TWITCH CHANNEL</a></p><p><strong>See extra content&nbsp;at our </strong><a href=\"https://rhlstp.co.uk/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WEBSITE</a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

There are a lot of talking points including the way the 60s began to define class and masculinity, how the Beatles symbolise love and Bond symbolises death, the sadness/trauma in the childhoods of most of the people involved, the bizarre way George Lazenby was tested to see if he was right for the part, the constant reinvention of Bond, how the idea of Fake Paul took root whilst the Beatles were about to die and Richard’s idea for&nbsp;John’s next book (which he doesn’t seem that interested in, so you can write it instead).

They discuss Richard’s feelings for Sophie's mum, being carried to bed by Joey from Bread, why Sophie was embarrassed when Jarvis Cocker used her toilet, the weird and sometimes horrifying culture of the 1990s, how Sophie has combined being a pop superstar with family life, falling down Esther Rantzen’s staircase and making up with Robbie Williams and how Sophie has made a life long career in a fickle business.

It’s eye-wateringly funny stuff with two childish old men who should know better.</p><br /><p><strong>SUPPORT THE SHOW!</strong></p><p>Check out our website&nbsp;<a href=\"http://rhlstp.co.uk/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://rhlstp.co.uk</a></p><p>See details of the RHLSTP tour dates&nbsp;<a href=\"http://richardherring.com/gigs\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://richardherring.com/gigs</a></p><p>Buy DVDs and Books at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://gofasterstripe.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://gofasterstripe.com</a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

They talk about the terrible behaviour of the Sheriff of Nottingham, how to explain modern day notions of gender to the old and confused, the previously unexplored positive sides of being in a human centipede, how comedy can help us cope with tragedy and our darkest thoughts, how marriages manage to survive for 40 years, whether Sliding Doors is a great film or definitely isn’t and whether masculinity is defined by stopping a child being hit by a baseball bat.

Plus he is mocked for his small feet and hands, which I don’t think is something therapists should be doing and they chat about the horrors of growing old.</p><br /><p>Come and see us live&nbsp;<a href=\"http://richardherring.com/rhlstp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://richardherring.com/rhlstp</a></p><p>Buy Richard’s new book here&nbsp;<a href=\"http://gofasterstripe.com/ball\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://gofasterstripe.com/ball</a></p><br /><p><strong>SUPPORT THE SHOW!</strong></p><p><strong>Watch our </strong><a href=\"https://open.acast.com/shows/61ba0fda1a8cbe093a3cf14b/episodes/61c493cb56400000142f487e/twitch.tv/rkherring\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">TWITCH CHANNEL</a></p><p><strong>See extra content&nbsp;at our </strong><a href=\"https://open.acast.com/shows/61ba0fda1a8cbe093a3cf14b/episodes/61c493cb56400000142f487e/rhlstp.co.uk\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WEBSITE</a></p><p><strong>See details of the </strong><a href=\"https://open.acast.com/shows/61ba0fda1a8cbe093a3cf14b/episodes/61c493cb56400000142f487e/richardherring.com/gigs\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">RHLSTP TOUR DATES</a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

They talk about the girl who smelled of spam and&nbsp;Sally’s impressive performance in the film “How To Please A Woman”, but they can’t avoid the elephant in the room and discuss there somewhat different memories of the break up of their relationship (and at least one of hers confuses a sketch with reality, but what is truth?) and how this impacted on their Edinburgh shows (and lives). </p><br /><p>Can they reach a place of forgiveness for their behaviour? Also&nbsp;Sally’s side of the Princess Diana love triangle, how being in a comedy gang in the 1990s gave us all too much confidence, how she got the job in Alan Partridge, what led to her working with Mr Tumble and speculation on why Hugh Grant doesn’t talk to her. Also the impact of disablist language (and an appearance from her son, Ol), grabbing the reins of power, being careful what you wish for, Dexter Fletcher and a tension that makes this one of the greatest and funniest RHLSTPs ever.</p><br /><p><br /></p><p><strong>SUPPORT THE SHOW!</strong></p><p><strong>Watch our </strong><a href=\"https://open.acast.com/shows/61ba0fda1a8cbe093a3cf14b/episodes/61c493cb56400000142f487e/twitch.tv/rkherring\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">TWITCH CHANNEL</a></p><p><strong>See extra content&nbsp;at our </strong><a href=\"https://open.acast.com/shows/61ba0fda1a8cbe093a3cf14b/episodes/61c493cb56400000142f487e/rhlstp.co.uk\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WEBSITE</a></p><p><strong>See details of the </strong><a href=\"https://open.acast.com/shows/61ba0fda1a8cbe093a3cf14b/episodes/61c493cb56400000142f487e/richardherring.com/gigs\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">RHLSTP TOUR DATES</a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

We also get to hear a bit of the book read out by Fishback and hear about the excellent TV pilot for the character and how Rich destroyed the dreams of two young comedians with a harsh dose of realism.</p><br /><p>Plus they talk about how many Kit Kats are made every month and how it would be better to invent a chocolate bar than write books, the two or more schisms that have been created by scones and the skill required to read an audiobook.

Richard is chatting to comedian and movie star,&nbsp;Omid&nbsp;Djalili. They discuss the films that he got cut out of, how he got cast in The Mummy, some surprises from the set of Sex and the City 2, the late, great Sean Lock, performing for the Queen and the role comedy plays in helping us move forwards. A great end to a fab run at the Assembly Rooms and Richard’s last ever Fringe show (perhaps).

He’s also bemoaning how left wing the Fringe has become. His guest is the indestructible force of nature that is Janey Godley. They discuss their somewhat different experiences of cancer and chemotherapy, how having cancer doesn’t make you brave, writing a love letter to the 1970s women of Glasgow, how to cheat your electricity meter, how Janey got cancelled before getting cancer and whether we should forgive people their trespasses if they are repentant.

Never mind - his guest(s) today are Conrad Koch and his little friend Chester Missing. They talk about what makes a normal human being turn to ventriloquism, how a puppet can be the best medium to discuss huge political issues (or they can be a carrot that fails to do double entendres properly), how Chester because a huge hit in South Africa and why politicians want to be interviewed by him, plus the revelation that the end of Apartheid was not the end of racism and why racism is white people’s problem. Richard decides to show Conrad how to do ventriloquism properly and so there’s an appearance from a certain cancerous bollock. Who is the best ventriloquist?

Richard’s final guest is Peter Dickson impersonator and product of 1988, Joe Lycett. The podcast largely turns into the vehicle for a RHLSTP clips show as Joe quizzes Richard about his favourite and least favourite guests and what the future might hold for the valuable RHLSTP franchise.</p><br /><p>But there’s also time to talk about identifying fish as they are slapped into your face, how much money Richard turned down to appear on TV with Katy Hopkins and the varying depravity of ex Blue Peter presenters. It’s a fittingly low key and relaxed end to the series. Series eight starts next week.</p><br /><p><strong>SUPPORT THE SHOW!</strong></p><p>Check out our website&nbsp;<a href=\"http://rhlstp.co.uk/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://rhlstp.co.uk</a></p><p>See details of the RHLSTP tour dates&nbsp;<a href=\"http://richardherring.com/gigs\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://richardherring.com/gigs</a></p><p>Buy DVDs and Books at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://gofasterstripe.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://gofasterstripe.com</a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

His guest is the mysterious, crude, offensive and hilarious&nbsp;Kunt&nbsp;from off of&nbsp;Kunt&nbsp;and the Gang. They chat about how this incredible act gained traction, why he retired in 2016 and what brought him back, the inspiration for his comeback and how subversive and satirical his childish work has become, whether he could or should be cancelled, whether joking about something is as bad as doing it, whether comedy is a valid response to tragedy and horror, why he’s a vegetarian and is he more sensitive and right on that he might at first appear. It’s am hilarious and fascinating conversation, but goes into areas that some may find inappropriate or offensive, but there’s a clue in the name.

Giving away a prize to a lucky audience member, Rich reminisces about schoolday bags and realises how much work he has got to do to re-learn his 11 old stand-up shows for his insane attempt to do them all at the Leicester Square Theatre in August and September. His guest is a man who has done Chekov, Dickens and Celebrity Juice, Johnny Vegas.</p><br /><p>It's a truly fascinating discussion about the duality of the stand-up and where a Johnny ends and Michael Pennington begins. Michael discusses the lengths that Johnny would push him to and his total commitment to being a dog on stage, whether contentment and success mean the death of the character, how to make your own audience out of balloons, why he got the worst degree in his year at University and how he got his revenge. Plus how Monkey has clung to his back like a monkey, and the funniest sex show in history. It's really good.</p><br /><p>SUPPORT THE SHOW!</p><p>Check out our website&nbsp;<a href=\"http://rhlstp.co.uk/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://rhlstp.co.uk</a></p><p>See details of the RHLSTP tour dates&nbsp;<a href=\"http://richardherring.com/gigs\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://richardherring.com/gigs</a></p><p>Buy DVDs and Books at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://gofasterstripe.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://gofasterstripe.com</a></p><p><br /></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

His guest is legendary comedian and DJ Paul Chuckle. They chat about Paul’s incredible 59 year career, from working mens’ clubs and routines with Charlie Cairoli, through talent shows and learning the craft to the big break with Chuckle Vision. What injuries did the boys have to endure for comedy? What was it like to be so recognisable? How did the distinctive Chuckle look develop? And how did they come up with the iconic To Me, To You. Plus working with Tinchy Strider and moving into DJing. Paul talks movingly about losing his brother/partner and best friend and why he needed to carry on working. And finally the truth about his moped accident.</p><br /><p>Live RHLSTPs coming up in the Leicester Square Theatre.

His guest is actor, impressionist and astronomer&nbsp;Jon&nbsp;Culshaw. They discuss Queen Victoria’s everlasting fire, how a receptionist set&nbsp;Jon&nbsp;on course to his comedy career, getting through to Tony Blair on a prank call, chasing solar eclipses, portraying David Bowie in a serious drama, whether it’s ever possible to get to know the person behind the impressions, Bill Dare’s bottom, playing a Thunderbird,&nbsp;the joy of Tom Baker and what it’s like to interview someone when you are being them (and why that has to become a podcast). Plus the remarkable&nbsp;skill required to become an impressionist of&nbsp;Culshaw’s standard.</p><br /><p>Live RHLSTPs coming up in the Leicester Square Theatre.

This week's guest is the former Westlife obsessive, Sofie Hagen.</p><br /><p>Luckily we're in a post-Brexit world now, allowing Rich freedom to let everyone know his true thoughts about Denmark and the disappointment that is the talked-up Copenhagen. They discuss what constitutes creepiness from a stranger, what's going on with the Danish alphabet, what happens when a fan is more famous than the person they stalked and Rich gives Sofie some important lessons in badger-identification and the British Royal Family, and kites lead us to some unexpected places.

His guest is the king of the clowns and circuit legend, Chris&nbsp;Lynam, who you might know from his firework up the bum routine, but who has a whole lot more to him than that. </p><br /><p>They chat about what Chris remembers of the early alternative comedy scene, working with Ken Campbell on The Warp, Malcolm Hardee overestimating how easy it is to light fireworks in your buttocks, the Greatest Show on Legs, ErictheFred (check out some clips from this beautiful show here&nbsp;<a href=\"https://chrislynam.net/eric-the-fred/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://chrislynam.net/eric-the-fred/</a>), what destroyed the spirit of alternative comedy (and Richard’s part in that), who destroyed the rainforest of Zimbabwe and how Chris nearly became impaled on a bed of nails. Plus the times that his perilous appearing act actually spilled over into real danger, the heart and soul of the clown and how Chris has managed to maintain the same level of madness without actually turning any more mad.

And it's a surreal, dream-like and occasionally mildly awkward chat about working with Ken Campbell; Richard's failure to see one of Diane's first performances; Bruce Willis on The One Show; Richard's ever-spiralling shoplifting problem; the slight let down of earliest memories (and what is the latest earliest memory that anyone has ever had?); and the importance of making it clear that you're not dating Joe Wilkinson.

With the world in shock about the accusations about an ex-BBC employee with long hair and an odd home life who raised money for charity, Richard is keeping his head down, but he is joined by the slightly odd men behind such hits as The League of Gentlemen and Psychoville, Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton. They chat about the unlikely character of Davey from Henry IV part II, what it's like to work with Woody Allen, as well as a RHLSTP exclusive - the name of the duo's next TV project. Find out where the inspiration for Papa Lazarou and the Psychoville Tina Turner tribute act came from, and the ghostly real-life occurrences that Reece has experienced. If you've ever wondered whether this pair would prefer a ham hand or a sun cream armpit then wonder no more. Have they seen a Big Foot? You'll have to listen to find out. Although if you don't have time to listen then the answer is no. This was a lot of fun to be a part of. I think you will like it.

What characters DIDN'T make it into&nbsp;<em>The League of Gentlemen</em>? What is the biggest fossil that he has ever discovered? Should Rich buy a metal detector?

They chat about working alongside puppets (in their own different ways), how&nbsp;<em>Love Island</em>&nbsp;has turned Iain into a huge Edinburgh smash, the tragedy behind the Amazing Bubble Man and whether somehow Richard might be Iain's dad. Then Richard is joined by the Radio Times Comedy champion and also champion poor time keeper,&nbsp;Jason Manford&nbsp;to chat about the old bamboo, setting up comedy clubs, bizarre coincidences and I think a misunderstanding about what a human centipede involves.</p><br /><p>SUPPORT THE SHOW!</p><p><strong>Watch our </strong><a href=\"http://twitch.tv/rkherring\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>TWITCH CHANNEL</strong></a></p><p><strong>Become a badger and see extra content&nbsp;at our </strong><a href=\"http://bit.ly/rhlstpweb\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>WEBSITE</strong></a></p><p><strong>See details of the RHLSTP </strong><a href=\"http://bit.ly/RHLSTPgigs\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>TOUR DATES</strong></a></p><p><strong>Buy DVDs and Books from </strong><a href=\"http://bit.ly/gofasterstripe\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>GO FASTER STRIPE</strong></a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

His guest this week is the Rod Hull faced comedian James Acaster. </p><br /><p>You will find out what it's like to survive three car crashes and two train derailments, how much you could expect to earn selling slurpies in Kettering in the 1990s and what it is that draws the police to conspiracy theorists. Acaster also completely Mitchells the new emergency question. But has he ever seen a Bigfoot? You'll have to wait until the end of the podcast to find out.

The pair discuss big foot-based anal sex, the disappointing lack of shenanigans in the bar at the 1997 reboot of Blockbusters, setting up Jack Bauer's Facebook page, penis-length anxiety, how Stephen accidentally ended up shooting a porn film, the Wookey Hole paper-mill, what it's like picking up Ricky Gervais' Bafta and the rigours of filming with Halle Berry. Tim from The Office might get a mention. Due to Richard getting a bit overtired and over excitable it goes a bit weird towards the end, but Stephen has achieved a lot of success through the comedy of embarrassment, so it's nice for him to witness some at such close quarters. You are going to enjoy Richard trying to dig himself out the hole he creates and doesn't seem to want to escape. It's an awkward end to a fun series of which Richard is both proud and ashamed.</p><br /><p>SUPPORT THE SHOW!</p><p><strong>Watch our </strong><a href=\"http://twitch.tv/rkherring\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>TWITCH CHANNEL</strong></a></p><p><strong>Become a badger and see extra content&nbsp;at our </strong><a href=\"http://bit.ly/rhlstpweb\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>WEBSITE</strong></a></p><p><strong>See details of the RHLSTP </strong><a href=\"http://bit.ly/RHLSTPgigs\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>TOUR DATES</strong></a></p><p><strong>Buy DVDs and Books from </strong><a href=\"http://bit.ly/gofasterstripe\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>GO FASTER STRIPE</strong></a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

The two small men swap stories about their funny and embarrassing dads, the humane imprisonment of children and discuss how much information you can get into a half hour TV show.

Richard’s guest is a man who has played all theatrical parts, but most notably the part of Brian Blessed.</p><br /><p>I couldn’t even begin to describe what happened on this extraordinary night, except to say it is was a bona fide happening. Try and predict how many words Richard will say in this. It’s a free form and extraordinary, yet sometimes beautiful and inspiring, journey through the career, philosophy and madness of a man who might be the greatest living Englishmen. How much of it is true? I can’t tell you. But at least some of it. Includes sticking it to Picasso, toileting on a mountain, biting umbilical cords, working with the young Peter O’Toole and Patrick Stewart, never dying and probably some other stuff. I can’t tell you. I had a little nap through most of it. Worth watching the video version to see my torture on what was one of the best experiences of my life. This podcast is absolutely unbeatable.</p><br /><p>Brian's new book is for sale here - https://www.amazon.co.uk/Panther-My-Kitchen-Wild-Animals/dp/150984158X</p><br /><p>SUPPORT THE SHOW!</p><p><strong>Watch our </strong><a href=\"http://twitch.tv/rkherring\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>TWITCH CHANNEL</strong></a></p><p><strong>Become a badger and see extra content&nbsp;at our </strong><a href=\"http://bit.ly/rhlstpweb\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>WEBSITE</strong></a></p><p><strong>See details of the RHLSTP </strong><a href=\"http://bit.ly/RHLSTPgigs\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>TOUR DATES</strong></a></p><p><strong>Buy DVDs and Books from </strong><a href=\"http://bit.ly/gofasterstripe\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>GO FASTER STRIPE</strong></a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

      "description": "<p><strong>#327 Double Robert Boris</strong> - Richard has some serious questions about Gio Compario from the Go Compare adverts and is also surprised to see online that he is currently single. That might make things awkward this week as he’s chatting to his (ex?) wife Catherine Wilkins. Will he find out anything he didn’t already know? And will it change things now that he’s back in the same room as his guest? They discuss whether porn films have it right about pizza delivery, writing a book whilst doing working at another job, how to convince men to do hoovering (and more), whether diarrhoea is a subject fit for a family circular, how Catie nearly committed murder, if she will leave her husband for a woman or have him replaced with a robot. Plus how is she worth so much more than Richard? It’s the flirtiest podcast he’s done since last week with Anneka Rice. </p><br /><p>Come and see RHLSTP live (or watch online) at the Clapham Grand.

In a frankly extraordinary, must-listen, funny, poetic and heart-breaking podcast Richard interviews quintessential Englishman (take that EDL) Stephen Fry. Find out what the Spice Girls said to Prince Charles about Prince Albert, the favourite expletive of Lionel Jeffries, why Fabian is the best character in Twelfth Night, why Richard is going to graffiti Fry's grave, which women Steve wants to have sex with, Richard's clunky attempts to audition for QI (will be more of that next week). Richard's clunky attempts to refer to Mr Fry as Steve, whether you have to read The Hobbit to be in The Hobbit, the commercial possibilities of an Ann Widdecombe sex tape, what happened when the Bishop of Bath and Wells went to a prison for young offenders and the insecurity of John Travolta. Some brilliant additional questions by Ben Evans age 12. And properly poignant revelations about mental illness. It is mind-blowing and moving. If you end up killing David Cameron after this podcast then that is not our responsibility. Next week classicist Mary Beard plus QI, Not the Nine O'Clock News, Blackadder etc producer John Lloyd.</p><br /><p>Come and see RHLSTP live (or watch online) at the Clapham Grand.

We’re at the prestigious Bill Murray pub in North London. Richard sits stage right for the first time (except when he interviewed himself for a kickstarter extra) and is being interrogated by John Robins behind a perspex screen. But is it to save the audience from corona or the people on stage from the unguents that will doubtless be flung by the Die Hard fans in attendance (why have they come to this? Surely they should be watching a DVD of Bruce Willis). They chat about The Problem With Men, whether there are regrets about old material, the philosophy behind stone clearing, the Stewart Lee issue, skirting the line betwixt political correctness and comedy and playing with madness as we plummet towards old age and death. It’s the real Richard Herring, not the crazy character (mainly) and includes new Emergency Questions sent in by listeners: Time travel, desert island Johns and Robins, penises, Japanese porn and much more.</p><br /><p>You can get an extra 30 minutes of chat by downloading the full show for just £8.

Ah it was fun, wasn’t it? We did do another batch a few years later, but check out the AIOTM feed and YouTube for those. Nothing capture the magic of a live cumpkining.</p><br /><p>As It Occurs To Me: Series 3, Episode 6: It's the end my friends. It really is. Really, really. But don't cry, just say goodbye, it could be worse. Rich has stories of CJ from Eggheads and Al Qaeda and is unjustly critical of a charity trying to de-worm orphans in Haiti, Emma has the best poo stories to make you sick, Dan is dressed as Adam Ant and Christian is looking forward to next week's show. Will Pippa Middleton's Disembodied Anus survive? Will King Herod make an appearance? Will Andrew Collins say 'aside' or make an appearance in real life? Will Rich have to take the cumpkin-based punishment prescribed by last week's Moral Maze or does he have some kind of revenge planned for the dark and mysterious forces that make the ethical decisions? I don't know, why don't you just listen to the podcast? All I can tell you is that tears or some kind of bodily fluid will be spilled before the show is over. As much as we travel in time, can we truly change our fates? It's properly the end folks. Thanks so much for your support or your 1 star iTunes reviews. It's been fun. Apart from the pain and mental illness.</p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

As it spirals towards the mountain that will put it out of its misery, Rich gets to think about this position in the comedy firmament after attending a Jerry Seinfeld gig (one of his last ever nights out with Andrew Collings). We’re trying to raise some money for live comedy venues with our latest kickstarter. Take a look at <a href=\"http://rhlstp.co.uk/kickstarter\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">rhlstp.co.uk/kickstarter</a> and back us if you like the look of it.</p><br /><p>As It Occurs To Me: Series 3, Episode 4: Rich and his forearm are regretting allowing the audience to make decisions about what is moral and what is not. He has been working hard on his punishment and is just hoping there is a 14-17 year-old boy who will be prepared to take the fruits (or seeds) of his labour. Dan, Christian and Emma are all lending a hand and together they have created one of the most horrendous comedy props in the whole of history. This show might actually break some laws. And if it doesn't then one of the weirdos in the audience definitely has.</p><br /><p>Rich had been trying to impress his girlfriend's parents and is coping with the stress of getting into the exclusive after show area at the Jerry Seinfeld gig on Friday. Emma has taken out a superinjunction on herself, Dan has been licking things in public and Christian has been recognised in a toilet in Ipswich. Perhaps foolishly there is another Moral Maze with even more dire consequences for Rich, Pippa Middleton's Disembodied Anus, and the return of an old favourite up to his old duplicity. Christian is up in arms about Britain's Got Talent, but not the stuff that's bothering anyone else. Plus there's the first real screw up of the 26 episodes we've done so far and we don't edit so we've just got to deal with it.

If you think it's cumpkins or dumpkins then you have to get with it grandad! And Rich has more than half an eye on the listeners of the future. He has also become disturbed by the Canadian couple who won't reveal the sex of their baby (is it as disturbing as Baby Massage? The babies seem to think so) and has been recognised in Amsterdam airport (but who has he been recognised as?).Emma is gate-crashing literary festivals and Dan has been enjoying some odd time with his family, whilst Christian may be close to being friends with the actual factual Lembit Opik. The audience for once come good and provide some spectacular tales of stuff that has occurred to them. This week's Moral Maze has to be heard to be believed and has consequences that could only have been predicted by the strangest person on earth, but demonstrates why the public should not be allowed to make decisions about anything of any importance. One of the characters has written a diary and Richard is halfway through the series without having had a nervous breakdown, but it can't be far off. Some of the accents in this show will make Cheryl Cole seem like the voice of 1950s BBC. And if Dan Tetsell gives you a cucumber, don't eat it. It's the longest AIOTM (aiotm) yet and maybe the funniest and you will learn things about penis enlargement that you might not want to know. But it'd be even funnier if you'd come and seen it live. People came from America, Mumbai and Salisbury to see this show.</p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

But he’s mistimed it all as TV is about to be usurped by the internet as this week’s guest Bilal Zafar is on the cusp of proving. They talk about being an arsehole in someone else’s dreams, working as an extra, Percy the Shepherd, the famous people of Wanstead and Bolton, Richard’s incredible generosity and vanity, befriending Limmy, the pigeon holing of TV commissioners and what can happen when you’re left to your own devices (as long as you have devices).

So thanks.</p><br /><p>As It Occurs To Me: Series 3, Episode 2: Somehow we've survived the Rapture, which has ruined Rich's plan to not write a script. We have a visit from a President and a future mayor and somebody's disembodied anus and from someone who would have made more of an impact had the news not somehow overtaken the show. I knew it was written too far in advance. Emma is worried about her parents, Christian pleased that his songs are being put to video and Dan is back, unsure what the worst thing about losing his child might be.

Plus since the last show Richard has won an award and lost at Mastermind and had to address whether he is real or imaginary. The nation is obsessed with certain parts of Pippa Middleton, but how far and how specific will this obsession be allowed to get? And what will happen if the cast revisit the Oxford Revue of 1988 and the ghosts that still haunt them? Were they funny then? Are they funny now? And in a new feature we lose ourselves in the moral maze to find out the ethics of floor Quavers. We also dare to reveal the truth about the super injunctions that other outlets will only do anonymously. Ah, it's good to be back. Really. Nearly all good.

Richard fears the consequences of being the 21st Century Dustin Gee, but not as much as Stewart Lee should. God is also keeping an eye on the chubby comedian's material and if His representatives on Earth are anything to go by then He doesn't like it. In the meanwhilst, Emma has met an iconic TV star, Christian is a rock god and Dan looks like someone's dad, though Ben Elton is not looking like an ah-argh stand-up comedian. Strangers are wanting to marry off Rich and his non-imaginary girlfriend and she may be up for it, even if Rich has been watching porn films 'for research'. Plus there's been some unseasonable behaviour for early October and a big surprise about one of the country's favourite sceptics. All in all it's good to be back. Hope you agree!</p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

But you can pretend it’s all still happening by listening to this hour of culturally insensitive bilge written under extreme circumstances even for this half-arsed show. Remember you can see the 10 year older Richard Herring who doesn’t even have the politeness to write a script now, strutting his stuff on <a href=\"http://twitch.tv/rkherring\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitch</a> most nights, including the all new Ally and Herring’s Twitch of Fun on Thursday nights. And you can preorder Richard's new book “The Problem With Men” <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Problem-Men-When-International-matters/dp/0751581453/ref=pd_rhf_gw_p_img_2?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=VNSGDKWQCYCN51GWTGKS\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> or at any major book retailer</p><br /><p>As It Occurs To Me: Edinburgh Special 2010: What a ludicrous idea. In a Fringe where Herring is already performing 36 shows in 26 days, what would possess him to write an hour of stand-up and sketches about what he has been up to? Utter lunacy. Christian didn't got to bed til 6am by which time Richard was up and furiously typing at his keyboard to bring you stories of ghosts in the swimming pool, the Pride of Scotland and how he is more Scotch than a significant proportion of Edinburgh residents. Emma is fascinated with caterpillars and not in a cute way and Dan has been watching some experimental theatre involving birdlife and faeces. Whilst the spectre of Richard Herring might hang over Andrew Collings' solo show, there is an elephant in this packed and chandeliered room which is at least reminiscent of Collings. With Haribo coming out of their eyeballs how will the sleep deprived cast cope with this early start? And who is the most Scotch character on their roster of freaks? You might be surprised by the answer.</p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

Rich has almost met Rory from Doctor Who and Lembit Opik on the same day, and is taking a pop at God for winging it when he came up with the 10 commandments, which seems a bit hypocritical given the way Rich puts this show together.

Is there any way back for us now? And is the way back to just keep doing the same sketch until people realise it is a new zenith of comedy? We've moved to the Bloomsbury Theatre because we think we're Virginia Woolf. Emma's been unable to use her new iPhone 4, Dan, who is half German has been praying for England to lose at football (so blame him) and Christian has been signing boobs because he is rock and also roll. We pull out the stops to annoy Bob Rudge and take a leaf out of the book of the lazy writers of My Two Dads. Blah blah blah Tiny Andrew Blah and we meet the odd daughter and dad from the Vodaphone adverts and eat the crumbs from out of God's kitchen bin, and what's going on with the high-backed armchair? It's repetitious and relies on stupid comedy voices and Rich has become everything he hates. But come in and join us, the cumpkins are lovely. And there's some stuff about football too.</p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

MOTORCYCLE CLOTHING SHOP SKETCH is here - and I am advising people to pull down statues. I am a visionary. This was recorded back in June 2010 remember. I am Nostradamus (or is that Emma Kennedy). <a href=\"http://gofasterstripe.com/badges\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Why not become a monthly badger</a> to celebrate me? </p><br /><p>As It Occurs To Me: Series 2, Episode 6: It's the 16th episode of AIOTM (AIOTM), 16 lost weekends of trying to satirise all comedy by producing a comedy show with no comedy in it. According to AM1975. As usual at this stage of the series, Richard is worried he is going mad and drunkenly wonders if he can convince some people who work in a motorcycle clothing shop that he has a motorcycle, to the amusement of only himself. Emma's dad is hanging out in bookshops enjoying his literary fame. Dan is wondering if he can get a laugh out of the King Herod bit that was written five minutes before the recording started, and Christian - whose guitar breaks just in time for his song - has a fine suggestion on how to solve the financial crisis.</p><br /><p>We're also trying to pull down the statues in Trafalgar Square, wondering how Richard has maintained a 20 year career in comedy when he knows no jokes, suggesting a new commentator for the World Cup, and considering if we should all have taken some cocaines to get some much needed publicity for the show. The real questions are: did Rich think the motorcycle thing was funny, or did he write it on purpose so the end would work? And does he have a high-backed armchair? Cos if he does, what other rumours will be true?</p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

His power struggle with double act partners past and present continues, but the real secrets are reserved for those brave souls who endured the heat and missed the football to pay to see the show live. Emma has a story that combines her love of celebrities and her love of poo, Dan wishes he was in Flight Of The Conchords and Christian takes on&nbsp;Billy Bragg&nbsp;and Gil Scott-Heron ensuring that the Venn Diagram of who understands which jokes in the show gets ever more complicated. Meanwhile Rich is a victim of more crime and is hoping elves will write the script so he can sit out in the sun, finally, just once before he dies. It's all post-post-post-post-post modern, which actually makes it quite old-fashioned in places. England won 3-1 by the way.</p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

Will they be driving to Barnard Castle to test their eyesight or wishing they could get their hair cut? I doubt it, because they lived in the happy beforetimes. And yet still they complained, the dolts.</p><br /><p>As It Occurs To Me: Series 2, Episode 1: Sony nominated AIOTM (AIOTM) returns for its second series. In show one, 'Richard Merring' forms an uneasy coalition and progressive alliance with Dan Tetsell and Emma Kennedy in the hope that they can curb his worst excesses. But it's a spring clean and all the old favourites are being purged. No cumpkins, no Quantum Leap and definitely NO Tiny Andrew Collings (aside: not unless he can somehow sneak his way in). You'll have to listen to find out if Richard made his flight back from the island of Cornwall in time for the show (aside: he did), if the show won any awards (aside: it didn't), and if anything amusing has happened to Tetsell in the last five months (aside: it hasn't, though he does nearly fall asleep at one point in the show, due to the rigours of being a father to a young baby). Is Richard super famous in Liverpool? What is worse than finding five men's sperm in your jack o' lantern? And can a man ever truly be in love with a lift if they are speaking different languages? And what will happen if we say we're going to blow Robin Hood Airport sky high? We might have to wait to find out about that last one. Who cares anyway when Christian Reilly is on an impossible mission to sort out the Greek economy? It's brilliant (aside: it's not. It's shit).</p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

Dan gets an unexpected gift from a stranger, whilst Emma is living in a cold and flooded flat, and Christian's mental breakdown seems to be surpassing that of even Herring himself. But while our musician rails against love, Rich is moving in with his girlfriend in order to replace his broken dishwasher and trying to sabotage Andrew Collings' career, even if success will only be a Pyrrhic victory. The world meanwhile goes crazy about Kay, Subo and the death of a rat and all we can do is quote Matthew 6 at it and hope that makes things better. All this is made harder by having to follow&nbsp;Stewart Lee&nbsp;who is clearly superior to us in every way. But has he been nominated for a Loaded Lafta? No, he hasn't.

His guest is just some guy from some old sketch show and the first Knight (that says Ni) on the podcast, Sir Michael Palin.</p><br /><p>Obviously Rich is in awe and on his best behaviour, but that won’t stop him bringing up one of Michael’s rare career disappointments and nearly derailing everything. But Michael is everything you’d hope for and you can find out what he got paid for his script being used in Sliding Doors, how the Fish Dance went down in North Korea, how Life of Brian might have been Python at its height, the perils of being a mud eater, how Mrs Palin ended up on Saturday Night Live, why Terry Jones was the heart of Python and how this remarkable friendship between writing partners was maintained right to the end.

After a week of just watching&nbsp;<em>Battlestar Galactica</em>&nbsp;and playing&nbsp;<em>Countdown</em>&nbsp;will Richard have anything new to say, or will he rely on ever more ancient callbacks?

His guest is legendary Bristol comedian Mark Olver.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>He discusses how his dad failed to catch a bungee jumper, living with Bristol’s most famous comedians, his move into TV Warm Up and his favourite ever Pointless (non-) player, how he has to carry on performing through vomit, horses and injury, how his birthplace has nothing going for it apart from ice cream and how best to describe the low-point of Richard’s career. A brilliantly entertaining hour from one of Bristol’s most modest sons, with a lot of material that will appeal to people who live within the environs of the city and are particularly interested in the road works of September 2019.</p><br /><p>SUPPORT THE SHOW!</p><p>Become a badger and see extra content&nbsp;at our <a href=\"http://bit.ly/rhlstpweb\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WEBSITE</a></p><p>See details of the RHLSTP <a href=\"http://bit.ly/RHLSTPgigs\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">TOUR DATES</a></p><p>Buy DVDs and Books from <a href=\"http://bit.ly/gofasterstripe\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">GO FASTER STRIPE</a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

Rich goes into a bit too much detail about a bout of food poisoning that, to be fair, he isn’t entirely finished with. But if fire can’t stop him, then neither can the squits.

Plus find out why the last chapter of her audio book might seem a bit faster than the others, Rich’s skill at taking off bras, the cruelty and redundancy of children and whether workaholism is a positive or negative force for comedy. Plus how Sarah’s dad used his engineering skills to try and solve a tricky conundrum.</p><br /><p>Get Sarah’s brilliant book (or hurried audiobook) here https://www.amazon.co.uk/How-Champion-Sunday-Bestselling-Autobiography/dp/1409174328</p><br /><p>SUPPORT THE SHOW!</p><p>Become a badger and see extra content&nbsp;at our <a href=\"http://bit.ly/rhlstpweb\" target=\"_blank\">WEBSITE</a></p><p>See details of the RHLSTP <a href=\"http://bit.ly/RHLSTPgigs\" target=\"_blank\">TOUR DATES</a></p><p>Buy DVDs and Books from <a href=\"http://bit.ly/gofasterstripe\" target=\"_blank\">GO FASTER STRIPE</a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

There’s more, how his This is Your Life almost got derailed by a chance meeting and a letter from his Mamie.

Stephen tells us how he came within a heartbeat of being in Top Gear and might also have been in The Office were it not for excellent advice from his (ex) manager. Also the pros and cons of being followed by a film crew during his first Edinburgh Fringe, the disappointment of not flying in an air ambulance and whether it’s more impressive to lose weight by accident or design. Some classic old Emergency Questions are pulled out of the bag and there’s a more serious discussion about whether comedians should write their own material. Another lovely tour podcast.

There is some discussion of who from Lee and Herring has had the more successful career (no spoilers) and whether there is any danger of a Slattery style breakdown from doing too many episodes of Pointless, whether House of Games will ever offer psychological training, how to get into the dying medium of TV and what is an appropriate height differential for lovers..

His guests are all utter comedy geniuses: Spencer Jones and Janey Godley and the comedian she magically produced from herself, Ashley Storrie. Spencer talks about where he gets his crazy ideas and how to make comedy from mundane objects in life, his tricky first gigs as Herbert Clunkerdunk and what his fifth season would involve. Janey and Ashley talk about how they have conquered the internet and ingratiated themselves with celebs (even if they don’t always recognise them), the dangerous stupidity of taking on either of them on social media, their refusal to compromise for TV folk and whether Catcher in the Rye is a price worth paying for not having John Lennon any more.

He talks to Sophie about privilege, who got the best A levels, magic forests, who Rich would hate most if he was God, using social media for sex, Whacky Racists and orgies involving human centipedes. With Vikki the chat involves appearing in a gay porn film, a missed opportunity with Elton John, Abba Tribute bands, Philip Schofield and falsified wikipedia facts.</p><br /><p>Sophie’s show can be found here - <a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/sophie-duker-venus\" target=\"_blank\">https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/sophie-duker-venus</a></p><p>Vikki’s show is here <a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on#q=%22Vikki%20Stone%3A%20Song%20Bird%22\" target=\"_blank\">https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on#q=%22Vikki%20Stone%3A%20Song%20Bird%22</a></p><p>Details of all the upcoming RHLSTPs is here <a href=\"http://richardherring.com/rhlstpt/tour\" target=\"_blank\">http://richardherring.com/rhlstpt/tour</a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

With Jena he discusses the reasons behind American gun crime, whether political comedy does any good, interviewing John McAfee and what kind of people have seen ghosts and what kind haven’t.

The King of Edinburgh is back for his 25th Fringe, though he is feeling under the weather thanks to his bloody stupid decision to breed and his possibly hubristic decision to play a 400 seater venue. But never mind he’s got two of the Festival’s most interesting acts to kick off this cavalcade of 21 podcasts in 24 days, Laura Lexx and Tony Law.&nbsp;Two guests on the same day? What? With Laura there’s discussion about ice lollies, whether global warming is a more pressing issue than Brexit, the repercussions of the Edinburgh accommodation crisis, defective chocolate bars and Johnny machines. And Tony chats about the contrasting previous appearances on the podcast, whether terrifyingly drunk or mind-bendingly sober and will it be third time, unwired? Well it’s Tony, so obviously not. Plus the differences between comedians in for the long haul and those hoping for fame, the craziness of Canadian comics, trying to put your children off performing and the acts creating unique shows full of risk. And how does he feel about turning 50?

His guest is We Know Where You Live’s Fiona Allen. She talks about working for Tony Wilson at the Hacienda, the unusual job of her grandfather, whether Michael Parkinson Senior is the most evil man on the planet, secretly delightful, disgusting household chores, whether it’s best to be up front on a date, why she knew Smack the Pony was going to be a hit (and whether it will return), British films and why so many disappear into the ether, returning to stand up as a more mature (but not necessarily more mature) performer and paying her children to empty the dishwasher.&nbsp;Turns out we don’t need an audience to make RHLSTP work, but we’d still like one.

It’s a truly remarkable and inspiring podcast from one of the loveliest men in the world who isn’t afraid to laugh at himself and make the jokes harsher than even Ricky Gervais can manage.</p><p> </p><p>SUPPORT THE SHOW!</p><p>Check out our website, become a badger and see extra content&nbsp;<a href=\"http://bit.ly/rhlstpweb\" target=\"_blank\">http://bit.ly/rhlstpweb</a></p><p>See details of the RHLSTP tour dates&nbsp;<a href=\"http://bit.ly/RHLSTPgigs\" target=\"_blank\">http://bit.ly/RHLSTPgigs</a></p><p>Buy DVDs and Books <a href=\"http://bit.ly/gofasterstripe\" target=\"_blank\">http://bit.ly/gofasterstripe</a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

Plus working on a shopping channel, how Steve Coogan confused America and thinks he is better than a puppet.</p><br /><p>SUPPORT THE SHOW!</p><p>Check out our website, become a badger and see extra content&nbsp;<a href=\"http://bit.ly/rhlstpweb\" target=\"_blank\">http://bit.ly/rhlstpweb</a></p><p>See details of the RHLSTP tour dates&nbsp;<a href=\"http://bit.ly/RHLSTPgigs\" target=\"_blank\">http://bit.ly/RHLSTPgigs</a></p><p>Buy DVDs and Books <a href=\"http://bit.ly/gofasterstripe\" target=\"_blank\">http://bit.ly/gofasterstripe</a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

Richard is incredibly and justifiably rude about the fifth worst city on the planet, but does he secretly love the place? His guest is local boy made good; author, journalist and defender of Wolverhampton (apart from the racist bits) Sathnam Sanghera. The pair discuss what it was like to work on Live TV (with an amazing revelation about Topless Darts); what it was like being an ordinary person going to Oxbridge; sharing a flat with John Oliver; the universality of the story of Bros and whether one of them has had work done; the figurative and literal madness of family life; and losing religion (and sometimes hair).

And to celebrate this occasion there's a record breaking fourth appearance from the grandson of a Batman, Adam Buxton. Adam sets the agenda from the start, bearing gifts, mocking stone-clearing like a philistine, revealing what 1995 Richard Herring had somehow discovered annoyed Stewart Lee, and attempting a slightly underwhelming tribute to Groundhog Day. Plus find out how Nile Rodgers responded to jokes by kids; why a head in a jar has to bring its own cloth; whether it's possible to have a film set at Stonehenge without the stones being knocked over at some point; and whether child-men in their fifties have to finally grow up. Plus some extraordinary epistles from World War One and how fields with barbed wire can still cause injury even today. Thanks to everyone who has supported this endeavour over the last 200 episodes and six years. Hopefully we can continue to move onwards and upwards.

Richard has finally won a TV quiz show and I am afraid he will never stop talking about it again, but he's nervous as Hell because one of his heroes is on the podcast and he's sure he'll screw it up, it's ex-Fun Boy Three-er Terry Hall. They discuss the dynamics and disagreements that come with collaboration, the nostalgic sexual time waves of early 1980s fashion, the one occasion when Terry laughed, being mistaken for a ventriloquist by the taxman, why the greatest album of all time only made it to 95 in the charts and why Terry didn't end up as a hairdresser. There's some serious chat about sexual abuse and depression and how Terry had dealt with these traumas and some cruel assessments of the town of Coventry. And can the power of RHLSTP finally get the album Home to number 1 where it belongs? No, I don't think so. It doesn't seem to be commercially available.

HIs guest this week is actor, writer and a man who might be able to take on Michael Palin for the title the nicest man in show business, Sanjeev Bhaskar. They talk about working with a tiny James Bolam; Richard's drunken debauchery and theft at a corporate gig in the early 90s; how Sanjeev's big break rested on the toss of a coin; the real life origin story of The Kumars and how a TV executive attempted to ruin it; and how Sanjeev ended up marrying his own grandmother.

Rich is back on the telly, even if at this point, House Of Games is looking like it might be another House of Horrors, but if he plays his cards right he might be able to get on another quiz show, because his guest is the host of !mpossible, it's Rick Edwards. Find out how Ruby Wax helped steer his career; what it's like to get married in Kew Gardens; how Rick upset Jake Gyllenhaal; and if it's true that he has no sense of smell. Richard attempts to pull down the concept of Alternate Universes, but fails (if only we'd been in the Universe where he succeeded in making his point) and the pair discuss whether being incredibly handsome has damaged their careers. Plus Backgammon, Rick and Morty and some pretty successful attempts by Richard to remember pop culture things that no one else recalls.

Drunk from one beer from last week's podcast, Richard is indiscreet about one of his former girlfriends, but let's move quickly on to welcome Lucy Porter and Jenny 'The Vixen' Ryan from the excellent Fingers On Buzzers Podcast. Rich finally gets to dedicate a whole podcast to his quizzing failures and to envy Lucy for the number of extra shows she's been on. We hear about behind the scenes on the Weakest Link; how Lucy and Jenny met on a record breaking episode of The Chase; who knows the most about their home town; foot fetishism; sexual awakenings during Hi-de-Hi!; how creating a quiz show can make you a millionaire; and which celebrity from Croydon Richard would most like to have sex with.

They discuss the beauty of being allowed to be silly in a serious world; whether Tom Daley should be sponsored to go to Pride; the Daily Express making mountains out of molehills; how a TV chef did not appreciate a joke about chicken jerk; and how envy can eat you up and how age can soften its grip. We also learn about Joe's new projects, including the Great British Sewing Bee, and hear from Esme, one of the judges of that show, who is in our front row and is rather well refreshed after a day out with Joe.

And he meets some men who work in IT in his audience, which is a novelty, but wait till you hear about the marital status of one of them... His guest is a woman he worked with just four days before recording, though she seems to have forgotten all about it, Amanda Abbington. Can she name the cast of Man Stroke Woman? How many times has she appeared on The Bill? What is Nicholas Lyndhurst's acting secret? Has she played Give Us A Clue with Una Stubbs? And Rich recounts how he has twice failed auditions to appear in shows with her. Rich makes a pitch to appear in Death In Paradise, which might not quite work out for him and there's chat about UFOs, sex robots and more evidence that drinking alcohol might not be the best preparation for a long-form interview.

He always hated podcasts and was just using you to get back on the telly. But while he's waiting for the phone to start ringing there's time for another chat, this time with the journalist and broadcaster James O'Brien. Recorded on a particularly depressing week, but maybe not as depressing as the world you're living in as you listen to it, there's some serious dissection of Brexit, Trump and how fake news and indignation have stymied debate. Find out about James' time as a showbiz reporter, his investigations into the truth behind Interval and more from his book 'How To Be Right In A World Gone Wrong'. Is there any hope? Are we learning what it was like to live through the rise of Hitler? Has James ever tried to suck his own cock (don't know, forgot to ask)? And is the way through all this just to drink eight craft beers and let the anti-depressants cheer you up? And there's a revelation about his Red Dwarf/Star Trek knowledge that will destroy his credibility forever...

Richard's participation in a PTA quiz in his village led to an unlikely correspondence with one of his new neighbours, but he's really looking forward to meeting the star of Twilight and The Damned United - oh no, he had to pull out, so we got Nish Kumar instead. But lucky us (apart from the obvious bad luck) because we get to hear about Nish shitting himself on camera watching a man get down and dirty with a horse; being the worst Taskmaster contestant ever; the best use of a House Of Games trophy; and what it's like to lose it on Question Time. How's Brexit going to turn out and why can't Brexiteers stop themselves leaving? Plus the unpredicted but satisfying success of The Mash Report. If you're hoping Michael Sheen might pop up as a surprise guest at the last minute then I am afraid you will be disappointed (hopefully we can get him to come down in 2019) but there is a brief ray of light as he sends us a message.

Richard gets pathetically drunk on just one bottle of Beer 52 beer and is scarcely able to remember how to speak, let alone recall what was discussed, but it includes a lot of racist attempts to do the English accent by Rose; plus what it's like to be up the tallest building in the Southern hemisphere; 'women's things'; an attempt to understand millennials; waiting for Burt Bacharach; watching your pet die; and the New Zealand version of The Horny Time Traveller.

They discuss schoolday soilings; dick-lifters; being related to a ghost; little Alex Horne; the exquisite pain of laughing when you're not meant to; sex with teddies; the saddest of bachelor meals; the death of two fathers; the devastating surprise of ageing; what it takes to be in your fifties; the weirdest group of celebrities to gather at Buckingham Palace; and the wondrous comedy of commitment to joyous stupidity.

Richard has been publicising his latest book, but it's not popular with canines, but at least he's got daytime DJs asking some wholly inappropriate questions. His guests this week are Hannah, Taylor and a slightly familiar Catie, from the Drunk Women Solving Crime podcast. Can the inebriated females solve a mystery that has remained mysterious for sixteen years? What crimes has Richard had carried out upon his small person, can he and his wife get through this podcast without resorting to divorce? What kind of crimes do they have on the Isle Of Wight and how effective are the police? Plus sex robots, pond-pushing and the beautiful autonomy of podcasting.

She talks about the decision to do Britain's Got Talent and the seemingly shocking truth about some of the contestants; how she chanced into impressionism thanks to an acting audition; what kind of crimes Noddy can solve in this crazy PC world that had dulled Enid Blyton's fine morality; and questionable fashion choices.

But it's not like living in the country has driven him mad like a character from the dark mind of Alice Lowe. There's some chat about the insanity of giving birth and how Alice managed to conjure up a hit film whilst seven-months pregnant; the terrible and slightly sexy things that happen on camping trips; the Keswick Pencil Museum; whether TV dulls the creative experience; winning the Perrier with the cult hit Garth Marenghi; and maybe the most convincing ghost story yet.

Toby demonstrates his skill of being able to name the character and episode of Doctor Who that any actor appeared on, chats about interviewing Doctor Who actors before they die, and Rich reveals that he has worked with both Baker Doctor Who's and who is his favourite. But it's not just Doctor Who. They also talk about Servalan from Blake's Seven. Before returning to some more Doctor Who based chat.

Rich has just had the biggest gig of his career and now he's in a Tabernacle somewhere in Wales, but that's showbiz. At least he has met and very slightly affected the life of a man he loves. Two guests packed into the regulation hour here, with ex-zombie Jessica Fostekew and delightfully bonkers Holly Burn ramping up the laughs at this lunchtime gig. Jessica has been in a fight at the festival and recounts tales of time holes, Nightmare Live, a great new TV format, and sharing train rides with a stalker (of other people). Holly tells tales of being the world's worst bridesmaid, finding your inner clown, what happens when Posh Spice retweets you, and her plans to visit her namesake. Plus Rich demonstrates why you should never tell comedians what to do, and discusses truth in comedy.

It's the end of the series and Rich wonders how tourists in Kings Cross will feel if their last action on earth is to queue to stand by a fictional wall. His guest is a man who has a lot of stories about how he got into comedy, it's Mark Steel. They chat about eating pork pies with Joseph Heller, helping failed escapologists, an idea for a brand new Radio 4 panel show, whether you can stand for political office and still be a comedian, the extraordinary story of Mark's birth parents, what it's like having a child going into comedy, and getting your own back on a snooty Darwin expert. It's a fabulous end to what has surely been the best series yet. Will the commissioners bring the show back? Yes of course they will - more in September (and a couple of specials coming out before then too).See Rich on tour: www.richardherring.com/ohfrig/tourBecome a Dripster and help us make more podcasts: http://d.rip/richard-herringBecome a monthly badger and help us make more podcasts: www.gofasterstripe.com/badgesSign up for renewable energy and receive £50 credit and probably save money on your bills with Bulb: https://bulb.co.uk/refer/richard234<hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

Richard's guest is a man who has played all theatrical parts, but most notably the part of Brian Blessed. I couldn't even begin to describe what happened on this extraordinary night, except to say it is was a bona fide happening. Try and predict how many words Richard will say in this. It's a free form and extraordinary, yet sometimes beautiful and inspiring, journey through the career, philosophy and madness of a man who might be the greatest living Englishmen. How much of it is true? I can't tell you. But at least some of it. Includes sticking it to Picasso, toileting on a mountain, biting umbilical cords, working with the young Peter O'Toole and Patrick Stewart, never dying and probably some other stuff. I can't tell you. I had a little nap through most of it. Worth watching the video version to see my torture on what was one of the best experiences of my life. This podcast is absolutely unbeatable.

The ex-flat mates discuss what happens when a 16 year-old Frank Spencer is put in charge of a super tanker; the most inappropriate way to greet the death of someone's loved one; who was right in the war over bread; Jean Valjean bumming people while looking like Peter Baynham; what it's like to meet Adam Sandler; how Peter nearly turned down Borat and somehow didn't turn down Arthur; what Chris Morris is like in real life (he's nice); the lost answerphone messages that could destroy careers; Lee and Herring's part in the creation of I'm Alan Partridge; running away from an audience; and the mad thoughts that plague the diseased minds of (at least these two) comedians.</p><p><br /></p><p>SUPPORT THE SHOW!</p><p>Check out our website and become a badger and see extra content <a href=\"http://rhlstp.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://rhlstp.co.uk</a></p><p>See details of the RHLSTP tour dates <a href=\"http://richardherring.com/gigs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://richardherring.com/gigs</a></p><p>Buy DVDs and Books at <a href=\"http://gofasterstripe.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://gofasterstripe.com</a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

Find out about two moments from the life of Benedict Cumberbatch; how Rich bonded with Adrian Chiles; and why Danielle loves Debbie McGee.

Richard's living in a house of horrors and has heard a ghost, so he's glad to be back in the safety of lovely, undangerous London to find out if Kathy Burke is as cool and amazing in real life as you really hope that she is. She's cooler than the coolest cool kids. They chat about the many paths taken from Educating Marmalade, where you might unknowingly have first encountered Kathy, when Perry met the Manics, who is best Harry Enfield or Gary Oldman, a reluctant visit to Cannes, why Burke moved from acting to directing and the joys of Oscar Wilde. Also featuring Horne and Corden, the Mona Lisa and not being in Doctor Who. A new notebook, new chairs and new microphones - sorry audiophiles about the last one of those - we will be back to uncrackly next week.</p><p><br /></p><p>SUPPORT THE SHOW!</p><p>Check out our website and become a badger and see extra content <a href=\"http://rhlstp.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://rhlstp.co.uk</a></p><p>See details of the RHLSTP tour dates <a href=\"http://richardherring.com/gigs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://richardherring.com/gigs</a></p><p>Buy DVDs and Books at <a href=\"http://gofasterstripe.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://gofasterstripe.com</a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

Richard celebrates 10 years of podcasting by blowing your comfortable views of the film Toy Story apart like Spike with a firework. His guest has come prepared in an attempt to Louis Theroux Herring, but he isn't Louis Theroux, he is Dave Gorman. They discuss why Dave stepped down as team captain on the panel show What The Dickens?; how to get the Happy Feet knock off Tappy Toes at a knockdown price; how Dave and the short-sightedness of Channel 4 were instrumental in the success of John Oliver; the story behind the righteous take-down of Neil Sean; the next generation of double acts; why you still get incensed when you're a quiz show winner; and how to make your kids' toys talk German.

The question of ham hands versus suncream armpits has gone international and been introduced to a new generation in the most charming of ways. But hat confusion, decade old Big Brother news and chicken restaurants aside, it's a pretty serious podcast in which journalist Johann Hari discusses his fascinating new book, 'Lost Connections'. Are our views on depression and antidepressants correct or do we need to look at these subjects in a new way? Johann discusses how an encounter with an apple made him consider the importance of listening to our symptoms, plus the power that people have to overcome the systems that can make them sad or even give up hope entirely. Is Rich's dad crazy for wanting to engage with strangers or is Rich insane for being disconnected from his neighbours? Do possessions bring us happiness? Do lesbian monkey orgies have anything to teach us? And what can bring Muslims, punks and gay men together? No emergency questions. Unless you consider the future of the human race an emergency.

He discusses the one thing that is better than a shrek when it comes to improving existing franchises; how Reg did and didn't break his leg; how comedic genius can be passed on via the bladder; the ultimate victory of sibling rivalry; the slow realisation of the truth about OJ Simpson; how vanity is the greatest destroyer of men; being the fourth funniest person in your family; and many more surprising revelations regarding relativity. Richard worries about ageing and death, but Reginald does not. It's a revelatory chat with a comedian who possibly unwittingly inspired this whole podcast series.

He has the Prime Minister from an alternate timeline on his podcast, plus a bloke who bought fags from Mrs Merton, it's the unlikely twosome of Ed Miliband and Geoff Lloyd. They discuss the pair's great new podcast Reasons To Be Cheerful, plus the Millstone, the sandwich and David Miliband's shoes. Is losing an election in anyway comparable to a triple loss on Pointless Celebrities? Can you be too clever for Win, Lose Or Draw? And is the political system of the UK screwed. There's some tough questions about Brexit (though to be fair Ed is asking most of them), and the difficulty of being a politician and being yourself. You might end up wishing you lived in the Miliverse. Or at least have some ideas for redecorating your kitchen? And will Richard ask the Emergency Questions you all want to hear answered? And will Ed answer?</p><p><br /></p><p>SUPPORT THE SHOW!</p><p>Check out our website and become a badger and see extra content <a href=\"http://rhlstp.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://rhlstp.co.uk</a></p><p>See details of the RHLSTP tour dates <a href=\"http://richardherring.com/gigs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://richardherring.com/gigs</a></p><p>Buy DVDs and Books at <a href=\"http://gofasterstripe.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://gofasterstripe.com</a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

They chat about Red Wedge, accordions, out-Catholicing Frank Skinner, performing in German and John's bold plans to create 'Dead At The Apollo' a showcase for comedians over 50.

Richard is surprisingly appalled by what a sex robot inventor is planning for his sex robot and reeling from the brutal combo of no sleep and attending a funeral, but life goes on and it's laughter all the way (until the end when it gets a bit bleak) with left-wing Stalin apologist Armando Iannucci. Armando reveals a surprising friendship with a 1990s pop group and the dark underside of Michael Palin before trying to ascertain who is worst: Weinstein, Stalin or James Corden. Rich gets busted about his behaviour at the \"Death of Stalin\" premiere and there's lots of chat about this excellent film and how being a director has changed Iannucci into a megalomaniac. Plus find out what happened when Armando started to learn the piano in his 40s and his near death experiences on holiday and how he has once again managed to copy all of Richard's ideas and pass them off as his own.

But on we plough until our own inevitable deaths. The guest today previously worked for Isis, it's Ellie Taylor, who claims to have grown up in Brentwood, but she doesn't know much about it or trampolining. Like you'd expect. They talk about the faces you pull when you're modelling for Matalan, being apparated in a box, the great Josh paedo postman betrayal, why cats are better than babies, having a heart made of diamonds, and much too much about genitals, but then some stuff about the cute things kids say to make up for the rudeness. Richard is so tired that his brain either says everything he is thinking or can't formulate basic words (so no real change there), but luckily Ellie is eloquent as he bumbles around the questions of body image and perceived attractiveness. Plus he gets to ask questions from the brand new EQ app!

She has written a phenomenal book called Animal which you really should buy https://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0571325246/comedyguide-21/ for all teenage girls, all teenage boys and everyone else too. There's some pretty serious chat about the chemistry of love, biology, abortion, the future of the world, whether things are getting better or worse and terrible human nature. But it's contemplative and positive and proves that Richard isn't actually the worst man on the planet, plus there's fun stuff about Just A Minute in a brain scanning machine and Sunday Brunch (with surprise guest) and a brilliant new game show where there's guaranteed to be one woman on every week. Plus all the Emergency Questions lead us to serious answers.

Richard is still prickling with mortification after an encounter with Michael Portillo, as if turning 50 and moving house wasn't enough, but he has still found time to read his guest's fantastic new book \"How Not To Grow Up\", I mean \"How Not To Be a Boy\", Robert Webb. They chat about their mutual inability to draw 8s; and hours (and relationships) lost to Civilisation II; the way tragedy (or not) can shape a comedian; where you would seek release if you were the only person left in the world; the tricky balancing act of making sure the right people are at your funeral; how we will view ourselves in 10 years time; and what our wives might think of us now. Plus imaginary friends, falling down stairs and going to school with Bros.

The King has returned and he's at the spooky New Theatre Grand Hall where the Masons get up to all sorts of mysterious time-travelling. And Richard is very excited to be welcoming comedy legends the Doug Anthony All Stars, Paul, Tim and Paul. There's lots of chat about the Edinburgh Fringe of the eighties, the point where comedy and tragedy meet, what happens when you become the carer for your comedy partner, what happens if you never wash your clothes, the Doug who became a diplomat, how Jerry Sadowitz terrorised the public, and curing rectal cancer. Sorry the first minute or so got lost, but I have attempted to recreate it (and it was nothing of any worth). Plus there's a beautiful song at the end which is going to leave you wondering why the audience is laughing, but suffice to say what was happening was very funny indeed. </p><p><br /></p><p>SUPPORT THE SHOW!</p><p>Check out our website and become a badger and see extra content <a href=\"http://rhlstp.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://rhlstp.co.uk</a></p><p>See details of the RHLSTP tour dates <a href=\"http://richardherring.com/gigs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://richardherring.com/gigs</a></p><p>Buy DVDs and Books at <a href=\"http://gofasterstripe.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://gofasterstripe.com</a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

Richard contemplates the now trickier commute to work that he has thanks to being forced to move to the country because he is 50, before introducing veteran comedian Brendon Burns and a man with only one credit, Craig Quartermaine. It's a more contemplative RHLSTP than usual, as the two Australians discuss the racial issues that many of their countrymen refuse to confront and how comedy can deal with questions of race (especially if a loud and mouthy bloke is teamed up with a quieter and indigenous one). Find out how this unlikely pair got together, how they reluctantly formed a double act, what makes a double act work and the awkwardness that both comedians revel in and have to cope with in their daily life and from people who have seen their show. It's a fascinating insight into guilt, embarrassment and the horrors of imperialism and how difficult it is to confront these harsh truths. Luckily it's funny too. Though sometimes uncomfortably so. </p><p><br /></p><p>SUPPORT THE SHOW!</p><p>Check out our website and become a badger and see extra content <a href=\"http://rhlstp.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://rhlstp.co.uk</a></p><p>See details of the RHLSTP tour dates <a href=\"http://richardherring.com/gigs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://richardherring.com/gigs</a></p><p>Buy DVDs and Books at <a href=\"http://gofasterstripe.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://gofasterstripe.com</a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

It's the first time the pair have spoken in over 60 months and it would be foolish to deny that there might be come tensions bubbling beneath (and all over) the surface, but there's still time for some banter that will take you back to the glory days of 2008-2011. Armed with emergency questions and an emergency folder of cherished tabloid memories the pair attempt to discuss the country's worst serial killers, the Mitfords, the evil of Cecil Parkinson, the debt they owe each other, the unresolved sexual tension (at least at the start of the evening), the disappointment of Northampton, decent and indecent proposals, whether it's OK to add cartoons to The Human Centipede and what the best kind of tape is. You will laugh, you will wince, you will remember the 1980s, but not possibly as fondly as Collings does. </p><p><br /></p><p>SUPPORT THE SHOW!</p><p>Check out our website and become a badger and see extra content <a href=\"http://rhlstp.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://rhlstp.co.uk</a></p><p>See details of the RHLSTP tour dates <a href=\"http://richardherring.com/gigs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://richardherring.com/gigs</a></p><p>Buy DVDs and Books at <a href=\"http://gofasterstripe.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://gofasterstripe.com</a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

They discuss their similarly comedy-nerdy teenage years, the early days of the alternative comedy circuit where Alexei Sayle's stream of swearing might be followed by flying fish or slowly melting ice. Can Paul remember the very first routine that helped him on the road to stardom (and partially define his persona)? - you bet a fortnight's holiday in Benidorm he can, and it's magical! Find out how close he came to death 30 years ago after breaking his leg and how anti-malarial drugs almost broke his brain.

      "description": "<p>Wells Comedy Festival Extra: Bec Hill - Passing The Baton. Rich has risked the wrath of everyone in his home town of Cheddar by travelling beyond the horizon to Wells, where the crazy people dwell, and doing a special podcast for the inhabitants. But don't worry Cheddar - he mocks the Wells insane asylum dwellers and won't let them get away with being called a city. He is armed with a copy, fresh off the presses of the new Emergency Questions book, which will be winging its way to kickstarter backers imminently and be available to buy at gigs and (very soon) from www.gofasterstripe.com. His guest is Australian exponent of the Japanese storytelling technique of Kamishibai, [citation needed] Bec Hill. They discuss what it is like to be married on stage (not to each other); unpleasant experiences with toilet rolls; and the strange way we allow a stranger with an X-Ray machine to focus; Adelaide's tallest building; being halfway somewhere; and find out if Bec has ever irked a postman. Plus some big news for Rich, inevitably sullied by inappropriate chat about genitalia.</p><p><br /></p><p>SUPPORT THE SHOW!</p><p>Check out our website and become a badger and see extra content <a href=\"http://rhlstp.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://rhlstp.co.uk</a></p><p>See details of the RHLSTP tour dates <a href=\"http://richardherring.com/gigs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://richardherring.com/gigs</a></p><p>Buy DVDs and Books at <a href=\"http://gofasterstripe.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://gofasterstripe.com</a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

It's the final episode of Series 10 of RHLSTP and Rich meets a bearded man who has married to find a partner (find out how he did it nerds). His guest is the laid-back and yet also intense (and rather beautiful) Peter Serafinowicz. They talk about how it's almost impossible to parody the new President of the United States, but the effective way that Peter managed it and his fears and plans should there be repercussions from the thin-skinned bellend. Also lots of chats about the two Brian Bs (Blessed and Butterfield) and how a stellar cast does not always lead to a commission. Plus behind the scenes at Guardians Of The Galaxy and Parks And Recreation and the Pudsey The Dog movie. Incredibly Adam Sandler's The Cobbler and the strange ego of Mr Tumble come up without Richard even mentioning them. </p><p><br /></p><p>SUPPORT THE SHOW!</p><p>Check out our website and become a badger and see extra content <a href=\"http://rhlstp.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://rhlstp.co.uk</a></p><p>See details of the RHLSTP tour dates <a href=\"http://richardherring.com/gigs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://richardherring.com/gigs</a></p><p>Buy DVDs and Books at <a href=\"http://gofasterstripe.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://gofasterstripe.com</a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

Richard quizzes his audience to find how little they have done with their lives, before introducing the comedian's comedian and avant garde comedy genius, Simon Munnery. In a frank interview Simon reveal the unwritten truth of Steve Coogan's 1992 Edinburgh Fringe hospital visit, how Mark Lamarr did the bravest thing ever witnessed on stage, how Simon met his wife as a voice in the darkness during a gig that was spiralling out of control, setting up a restaurant that doesn't serve food, and what it was like to play Malcolm Hardee's legendary Tunnel Club. There's a bit where he looks like he might try to punch Richard to the floor, but instead they settle the battle of the aged Alpha males in the most manly way possible. Munnery is the comedy god, but who is the strongest? It's a thrilling podcast in many ways, and some of it maybe better watched than listened to, but luckily you can do both. </p><p><br /></p><p>SUPPORT THE SHOW!</p><p>Check out our website and become a badger and see extra content <a href=\"http://rhlstp.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://rhlstp.co.uk</a></p><p>See details of the RHLSTP tour dates <a href=\"http://richardherring.com/gigs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://richardherring.com/gigs</a></p><p>Buy DVDs and Books at <a href=\"http://gofasterstripe.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://gofasterstripe.com</a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

Plus discussion of the new Leicester Square Theatre Stair Robot (which is a real thing, though in this conversation it is sometimes tricky to tell fact from fiction), why not-yet-disabled people are so idiotic and self-defeating when it comes to access and equal rights in general and who it is who needs to a magic drug to cure them.

They discuss what it is like to be in a double act where you actually like your partner, on stage vertigo, the Queen Mother's teeth, whether it's worse to lose a pet or be an orphan and a choice between getting students through their exams and international comedy fame. Richard risks derailing everything by asking the Vicar of Dibley some very inappropriate questions, but she is more than equal to them. Witches and ghosts and West Country and intergenerational rivalry feature, but can Richard make Dawn cry or reveal her evil side? Only one way to find out.

Rich is reeling from a Pointless betrayal of the twin-Judases, but he rises above it to introduce podcaster, writer, businesswomen, feminist and champion of diversity Deborah Frances-White. There are some fascinating stories of adoption, what Jehovah's witnesses can and can't expect from the earthly paradise, whether relationships continue in the after-life, and one of the best explanations of how privilege works that you will ever hear. Plus there's clarification on the robot sex dilemma and how it might be acceptable, the orifices of Jesus, and the place of humour in dealing with that which is serious.

Rich finds a woman in the audience who doesn't seem to know where she is, who he is or understand the concept of remembering. She continues to be bamboozled throughout the show. And perhaps with reason, as this chat with pretend aristocrat and real diabetic Ed Gamble takes some odd turns. In one of the giddiest podcasts for quite some time Richard tries out a lot of new emergency questions which prompt discussions about the sleeping habits of gametes, the dangers of falling into a river, an impression of Buzz Nigeria and whether asking someone if they're tried sashima is an acceptable question. A nuclear physicist is on hand to discuss the chemistry of jumping into a pool of something and Ed has to decide if he'd save Rich from crucifixion. There's also some chat about Mock The Week, Drunk History and how this whole podcast is very much a practice for interviewing a more famous guest. And a quiz about retailers leads to the invention of an exciting new board game. And we see the unwelcome return of Victorian idiot, Ally. </p><p><br /></p><p>SUPPORT THE SHOW!</p><p>Check out our website and become a badger and see extra content <a href=\"http://rhlstp.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://rhlstp.co.uk</a></p><p>See details of the RHLSTP tour dates <a href=\"http://richardherring.com/gigs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://richardherring.com/gigs</a></p><p>Buy DVDs and Books at <a href=\"http://gofasterstripe.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://gofasterstripe.com</a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

The pair chat about Wikipedia-based factual inaccuracies, the true story of how Chris was nearly Doctor Who, the technical realities of sewing people together anus to mouth, some thoughtful exposition about a world with realistic robots, whether opera is obviously shit or if it's actually good, why American TV produces the results that the UK seemingly can't, as well as having a smack down between the average Herring and Addison fans.

Rich has been laid down low with an admittedly indirectly sexually transmitted disease, but nothing can stop him from starting this 10th and now kickstarted series. His guest once dreamed of being a Roman Catholic Priest, but luckily chose a less religious route, it's Armando Iannucci. The pair discuss the rivalry and tensions in the world of classical music, what a post-Brexit Thick Of It might look like, the death of Stalin, how Veep was created, what you can find in the houses of former Tory ministers, and how close Iannucci came to being trampled by a hippo.

Welcome to another bonus podcast, this one recorded at the Podcast Festival at Kings Place, just hours after Jeremy Corbyn's second victory, which is not as interesting as the real-life reaction to the probably imaginary crimes of CJ from Eggheads (and how I failed to link him and the later bit about male nipples shows how tired I was). The guest is the Mandarin speaking, relatively handsome nerd and double Chortle internet award winner Dan Schreiber. The pair chat about monkey facts, casting a dwarf as a child in a Ken Russell film, if it's possible to spoon a ghost, crimes committed in dreams, and the amazing life of Buzz Aldrin.

Will he live up to Richard's hopes and be as nice and down-to-earth as he appears to be on screen or will it all go a bit Game of Thrones? There are some great insights into how he was persuaded to do some of his films, what happens when you go to a pub with your name, what it must be like to be in Chris Rock's posse, and how Sean Bean gets cheap shampoo.

Rich makes the Welshman feel at home by talking to him in his own language before discussing the famous people who've come from Carmarthen and the impact of the bridge over Blue Street. They compete to discover the worst hotel in Swansea and Elis wins by a toothbrush. Also find out how James' act has been ruined by Welsh football success, what we thought of the Ghostbusters controversy (I know that was a long time ago now) and who will have the funniest comedy hybrid child. And who is more oppressed, the Welsh or women? Or Welsh women?

The pair discuss the lengths that you would have to go to to out-vegan a vegan, why someone from Wolverhampton shouldn't advertise toothbrushes, another amazing kite story, the woes of the Labour party and what it's like to work under the dictatorial heel of Robert Webb. Also if you've ever wondered if Tom Parry has tried sushi then you're in for a treat. And here's hoping Windsor Davies hasn't succumbed to the curse of 2016 so you can still make the important choice that we're all having to make about him.

Also what would you do if you had the chance to destroy a space ship where a small majority of the aliens were evil? Should Dirty Britcom Confessions be seen as a compliment?

Luckily we're in a post-Brexit world now, allowing Rich freedom to let everyone know his true thoughts about Denmark and the disappointment that is the talked-up Copenhagen. They discuss what constitutes creepiness from a stranger, what's going on with the Danish alphabet, what happens when a fan is more famous than the person they stalked and Rich gives Sofie some important lessons in badger-identification and the British Royal Family, and kites lead us to some unexpected places.

They discuss Graham's first sitcom, why it is flawed and what he learned from it, the impact of the Brexit vote (which was really quite recent when we recorded this), the only funny joke in Zoolander 2, the farce of another American attempt to make The IT Crowd and whether it was a good thing that Richard once wrote nine sitcom episodes in ten weeks. How rewarding is it to work on the least respected on all art forms anyway?

      "description": "<p>RHLSTP #110: Windsor Davies or Your Wife? Matthew Crosby. Mean podcast Richard Herring delights in continuing to torment the people who pay his wages, but I think they largely enjoy it (possibly). Believe me the real Richard Herring is more embarrassed by his performance than you can ever imagine. His guest was another star of St Olave's Grammar School's production of Waiting For Godot and remembers the shock denouement that turned the theatrical establishment on its head, it's Matthew Crosby. Find out how Improvisation My Dear Mark Watson actually got its name, how Matthew made a bloody re-entry to a gig he'd died at, the dangers of high-fiving children you don't know, why his wife is a celebrity in India and witness what a monster Richard becomes on the rare occasions he meets someone shorter than him. Richard is reduced to tears of laughter during a very inappropriate bit of chat (but is it really that funny, or is he just tired?) and after that catharsis there is some serious late night chat about success and working with other people, before the pair wonder about buying a stunt kite. </p><p><br /></p><p>SUPPORT THE SHOW!</p><p>Check out our website and become a badger and see extra content <a href=\"http://rhlstp.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://rhlstp.co.uk</a></p><p>See details of the RHLSTP tour dates <a href=\"http://richardherring.com/gigs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://richardherring.com/gigs</a></p><p>Buy DVDs and Books at <a href=\"http://gofasterstripe.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://gofasterstripe.com</a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

There's a danger the whole podcast might just be a chat about Britain's best and worst tourist attractions, but luckily things move on to Luis Bunuel, where comedy meets art, what a baboon sounds like when it ejaculates, whether Sue Lawley liked Vic and a potential return of the Big Night Out! Also Terry Scott lookalikes, ghostly orbs, eating humous and the Moir family history. Plus what it's like to be a magnet for serial killers.

A weary Richard films the audience as evidence of dissent for the future fascist government of the UK, before introducing a man who comes with his own magical minor ticker tape parade, David Cross. Starstruck and clearly in disbelieving awe, Rich flounders around and mainly embarrasses himself, but luckily Mr Cross is able to come up with some amazing riffed comedy about frozen vegetables, Abraham and taking cocaine near President Obama, whilst getting a bit more serious about Donald Trump, the responsibilities of fatherhood, why Richard should probably not take hard drugs, the benefits of the middle-aged sketch show and David's part in the creation of Kickstarter. Richard hoped that he would so impress David that they would become good friends and could appear in Doctor Dolittle 3 together as method-acted monkeys, but I think it's safe to say that that will not happen. Cross put away an impressive amount of bitter during this podcast and still remains focused and coherent, but clearly needed the toilet near the end, which turns into a battle of the obstinately pedantic 1990s underrated sketch show stars. </p><p><br /></p><p>SUPPORT THE SHOW!</p><p>Check out our website and become a badger and see extra content <a href=\"http://rhlstp.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://rhlstp.co.uk</a></p><p>See details of the RHLSTP tour dates <a href=\"http://richardherring.com/gigs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://richardherring.com/gigs</a></p><p>Buy DVDs and Books at <a href=\"http://gofasterstripe.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://gofasterstripe.com</a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

Richard finds a bona fide cool kid in the audience and inexpertly attempts to mock him (you'd think he'd be better at comedy after all these years, but no), before introducing a force of nature and veritable river of consciousness, Tony Law, in his new mutton-chopped, ice-cream eating, alcohol-shunning, heavenly body impersonating incarnation. It's like his brain is a radio and someone is constantly swivelling the dial so that one moment you're on history, then fantasy, then insanity and then pinpoint sane philosophy. It's a discombobulating journey to go on, especially if, like Richard, you're getting a bit tired, but Herring gamely attempts (and largely fails) to get some questions in. In the end he more or less gives in, but Law is an unstoppable force of nature and cannot be silenced. Though the fear is that, at any point, something might happen to upset the fragile mental balance that somehow remains teetering on equilibrium... and that thing might very well be Desert Island Dicks. Finally, when the conversation turns to the supernatural things start to make sense. But Richard is knocked out and defeated and was right to say he wasn't looking forward to writing this blurb. </p><p><br /></p><p>SUPPORT THE SHOW!</p><p>Check out our website and become a badger and see extra content <a href=\"http://rhlstp.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://rhlstp.co.uk</a></p><p>See details of the RHLSTP tour dates <a href=\"http://richardherring.com/gigs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://richardherring.com/gigs</a></p><p>Buy DVDs and Books at <a href=\"http://gofasterstripe.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://gofasterstripe.com</a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

Richard is back (in his weightier incarnation) and has forgotten how to do this, but is excited about the possibilities of growing body parts in pigs, but worried about the implications of penis transplants, so it's business as usual, but with some new (but the same) emergency questions. His guest is the Wild Man of radio (and must always be referred to as such), Iain Lee. The pair discuss the pointless 17 year grudge that has hung over them, their mutual envy and the disastrous filmed meeting in 2001 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dakeVejvR3I), but they are united by their relative lack of success compared to their nineties contemporaries and after all this time attempt to heal the rift betwixt them. In an attempt to fill in Iain's early life on Wikipedia they discuss the perils of going to a school named after William Herschel, what it was like living in the town where Buddy's Song was filmed, and how to embarrass yourself in front of Roger Daltry. Richard tries to steer the Monkees-based conversation towards Metal Mickey (no doubt to discuss if it would be cheating to have sex with him), but Lee skilfully swerves and ends up talking about Monkey instead. There is also a frank discussion about whether the BBC were right or clearly wrong to sack Lee and the effects this had on his career and psyche. Good to be back. </p><p><br /></p><p>SUPPORT THE SHOW!</p><p>Check out our website and become a badger and see extra content <a href=\"http://rhlstp.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://rhlstp.co.uk</a></p><p>See details of the RHLSTP tour dates <a href=\"http://richardherring.com/gigs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://richardherring.com/gigs</a></p><p>Buy DVDs and Books at <a href=\"http://gofasterstripe.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://gofasterstripe.com</a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

It's the 100th Leicester Square Theatre Podcast and the last in this series, so we've flown a special guest in all the way from America at the licence fee payer's expense, it's Blue Peter's bad boy, Richard Bacon. And in typical fashion he turns up at the theatre having been out all night celebrating his imminent 40th birthday. Where does he get his energy from?... oh right. Find out about how he once cried salty tears on to Mansfield McDonald's salty gherkins, how he became Top Of The Pop's most notorious ever presenter by accidentally calling some people fat, why he has been banned from the state opening of parliament, how he took a forgetful plate-spinner to Las Vegas, what he knows about the Tales of Robin Hood, what part of his anatomy (other than his mouth and nose) he can breathe out of, and why this gives him another kinship with Herring on top of his Dicky first name and food-based surname. Plus what he REALLY thinks of Una Stubbs (he thinks she's nice). And he gives himself something else to apologise for in a lifetime of apology. He's a very entertaining and lovely idiot, but as you'll see, it's all down to genetics. Hard to believe his one attempt at stand up-ended so badly.

Richard is exhausted again because of his stupid, idiot daughter, but at least she's given him the excuse to finally get to have a go at soft play. He's got 99 problems, but his 99th guest isn't one, it's the multi-talented actor and improviser, Cariad Lloyd. There's another dissection of the short film Hallo Panda which Richard once again promises to watch, even though he clearly won't, plus find out what it's like to be a fan working on Peep Show, the abrasive character of genius improviser Ken Campbell, how George Osborne comes to Fringe shows in the hope of getting pencils, how Cariad very nearly destroyed the marriage of David Bowie, and what connects Taylor Swift and the tax on tampons. Plus there's some more serious chat about whether the BBC can survive (don't worry, they're not watching) and some less serious chat about how much it would cost to employ a successful comedy actor as a Christmas elf (as well as the danger of working with Santas who've been in James Bond films).

Find out why the new Muppets are offensive and wrong, if a house in Pontefract is really haunted and why being childish is a good thing. A baffling interjection from a couple of people in the audience leads to a discussion about rudeness in comedy clubs, the nature of offence, how different people can interpret the same events in wildly different ways and how being a comedian can lead you to some dark and deadly places, that are only very occasionally amusing as well.

But will he be able to keep a lid on the simmering mayonnaise vat of bitterness? Find out if David swears during sex, if he would allow himself to be raped by a ghost, why he's so obsessed with war that he's apparently wearing a poppy in January and if he enjoyed working the cloakroom for TFI Friday. There are also some more serious chats about the mindset of someone who paps a couple going for a walk with their baby and why there is so much antipathy towards Ben Elton. But it's possibly the funniest episode yet, with Mitchell, once again, giving possibly the definitive answers to some of the emergency questions.

Richard successfully guesses the job of a bearded man in the audience before introducing the luckiest man on planet earth, who knows what it is like to have sex with a robot, Jack Whitehall. Seething with unconcealed jealousy at Whitehall's career and more pertinently his partner, Richard contrives several different ways to kill his guest and his own wife and child. Don't worry it's just a joke. It's almost certainly a joke. Find out the real reason Kate Middleton married Prince William, how Whitehall screwed up a gold-plated publicity opportunity, what it's like working with Shearsmith and Pemberton and rugby's homoerotic origins. A man exhausted from childcare interviews a man exhausted from jet lag about robot sex and the result is predictably indiscreet and hilarious. Richard also forgets Jack's name right at the end, but no one will notice that.</p><p><br /></p><p>SUPPORT THE SHOW!</p><p>Check out our website and become a badger and see extra content <a href=\"http://rhlstp.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://rhlstp.co.uk</a></p><p>See details of the RHLSTP tour dates <a href=\"http://richardherring.com/gigs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://richardherring.com/gigs</a></p><p>Buy DVDs and Books at <a href=\"http://gofasterstripe.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://gofasterstripe.com</a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

His guest is the immaculately dressed and multi-talented Phill Jupitus, who isn't so good with names. They chat about giving U2's new song a minute of air play, whether stand-up is harder than acting, how the most difficult person to please is always your mum and why the BBC is doomed. Get the behind the scenes info on Buzzcocks' guests Jedward and Jamelia and witness an old emergency question morph into something new and even more disturbing.

It's an unsurprisingly sprawling but incredible conversation that takes us through why God doesn't reveal himself, through the clumsy religious allegories of CS Lewis, through what kind of madness would make a man run 43 Marathons in 51 days, how to pronounce Calippo, how Eddie would have fared in the army, his political ambitions and philosophy, performing in languages that you were recently unable to speak, the short-sighted nature of the Ocean's Eleven franchise, the years of struggling to make it (with some great stories about his street theatre days) and why the world needs to come together and give everyone hope.

Richard is amazed how a joke on Twitter now pretty much always gets taken at face value by someone, even if it's in an open letter to an 8 month-old baby. His guest is Nicole Kidman impersonator and fantastically thoughtful yet and puerile stand-up Sarah Kendall, fresh from her nomination for the big comedy award at the Fringe. They discuss the horrors of child birth, the redundancy of the hand job, growing up in New Newcastle, how audiences can sometimes laugh in the wrong way, the plot holes in Back To The Future, loads of stuff about cocks and vaginas (obviously), the inevitability of nuclear destruction, plus some surprisingly serious bits about the nature of being a stand-up. To be honest, most of the time we forgot that we weren't sitting in the lounge in our Edinburgh flat having the kind of conversations with one another that are totally unacceptable in the actual world.

Richard discusses some zombie based movie ideas he has had, before introducing the dry-witted and incredulous Diane Morgan who isn't quite sure what she's let herself in for. And it's a surreal, dream-like and occasionally mildly awkward chat about working with Ken Campbell; Richard's failure to see one of Diane's first performances; Bruce Willis on The One Show; Richard's ever-spiralling shoplifting problem; the slight let down of earliest memories (and what is the latest earliest memory that anyone has ever had?); and the importance of making it clear that you're not dating Joe Wilkinson. Find out who Diane would kill if she had one bullet and no repercussions, and what she thinks might be in a medieval pie.</p><p><br /></p><p>SUPPORT THE SHOW!</p><p>Check out our website and become a badger and see extra content <a href=\"http://rhlstp.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://rhlstp.co.uk</a></p><p>See details of the RHLSTP tour dates <a href=\"http://richardherring.com/gigs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://richardherring.com/gigs</a></p><p>Buy DVDs and Books at <a href=\"http://gofasterstripe.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://gofasterstripe.com</a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

And it's a PODCLASH as his first guest is the host of the brilliant Comedian's Comedian Podcast as well as Richard's backdoor neighbour, Stuart Goldsmith. With (pretty much) all new emergency questions to try out there's a lot to talk about including how to breathe fire, what Rumpel the Kangaroo King is really like, the BBC's plans to transport all children to the future.

It's the last show in Series 7 and there's an end of term atmosphere and a lot of good natured heckling from a slightly inebriated crowd. Richard's final guest is Peter Dickson impersonator and product of 1988, Joe Lycett. The podcast largely turns into the vehicle for a RHLSTP clips show as Joe quizzes Richard about his favourite and least favourite guests and what the future might hold for the valuable RHLSTP franchise. But there's also time to talk about identifying fish as they are slapped into your face, how much money Richard turned down to appear on TV with Katie Hopkins and the varying depravity of ex Blue Peter presenters.

The pair try and fail to remember an ancient Twitter spat, and Richard threatens to reignite it by trying to welcome his guest by talking to him in his own language. There's a lively discussion of Scottish politics, the sexual allure of fake tan and whether it's funny to envisage the death of your own father.

Does their onscreen sexual chemistry spill over into real life, even when Rob's genitals are in a bag? Does a filling make you a robot? How exactly do you kill a turkey?

His guest is a man who has done Chekov, Dickens and Celebrity Juice, Johnny Vegas. It's a truly fascinating discussion about the duality of the stand-up and where a Johnny ends and Michael Pennington begins. Michael discusses the lengths that Johnny would push him to and his total commitment to being a dog on stage, whether contentment and success mean the death of the character, how to make your own audience out of balloons, why he got the worst degree in his year at University and how he got his revenge. Plus how Monkey has clung to his back like a monkey, and the funniest sex show in history.

Richard chats to his audience, with faces old and new, including a mum and daughter that lead him to some dark thoughts and a laughing financial advisor. His guest is eccentric, comedic barmpot, Lou Sanders who reveals her sexy French inner clown, how she foresaw her own death and how she used comedy to cope with breaking up with her fiance. Richard reminisces about their short-lived show on Fubar radio, tries to discover what reiki actually is and is forced to contemplate whether aliens exist. Surely this is the guest most likely to have ever seen a Bigfoot? But even Lou isn't as strange as the inhabitants of LA. You will see this fantastic comedian in all her confident fragility and uncompromising honesty as she achieves a rare accolade: confusing some Reeves and Mortimer fans.</p><p><br /></p><p>SUPPORT THE SHOW!</p><p>Check out our website and become a badger and see extra content <a href=\"http://rhlstp.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://rhlstp.co.uk</a></p><p>See details of the RHLSTP tour dates <a href=\"http://richardherring.com/gigs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://richardherring.com/gigs</a></p><p>Buy DVDs and Books at <a href=\"http://gofasterstripe.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://gofasterstripe.com</a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

The triumvirate remember the Edinburgh Fringe 1997, with the stage version of TMWRNJ which led to the TV series and how Trevor and Paul had Richard's penis waved in their face on a daily basis (in a play). They chat about how they were both witnesses and would-be saboteurs to the burgeoning romance between Richard and his one-time Shrine-based obsession, Julia Sawalha. We also chat about the special relationship that Trevor enjoyed with Nathalie and Paul's specialised expertise in performing as russet coloured disembodied heads.

But there's still time for Goldacre to raise questions about his sexuality, talk about his pop star mum and discuss his 'friend's' attempts at autofellatio. Can nutritionists work out your allergies by moving your limbs? Are Beroccas just homeopathy for sceptics? Is Lancaster a real place?

Al Murray had to drop out due to illness and so Rich was forced to find a new guest who could get to central London in an hour. And that guest was Michael Legge - no, not the one from the film Angela's Ashes or the blind or deaf Hereford-based massage therapist. The one from the Bollings and Nerrin Podcast. I can only apologise. But it turns out that the podcast might be even better with no preparation (ha, as if there's any anyway) and last second bookings cos Michael has funny stories about how he copes with people playing music on the bus, falling out with Robin Ince, Richard's inability to clap, and why he won't eat stuff that's come out of an animal. And there's more serious chat about the rise of the new-sexism in comedy and an almost entirely successful comedy of nostalgia about a show that nobody in the audience seems to have heard of. It gets awkward and weird, but they push through that and find some funny stuff again.

Richard has been considering his own mortality after a visit to Highgate Cemetery, realising that one day he himself might die. But it's unlikely. So let's sniff Dicks whilst the sun shines and we have the biggest Dick so far in the series (though not the biggest guest) with host of Two Tribes and Pointless, Richard Osman. Rich pitches all manner of TV shows to the highly successful TV producer, who seems unimpressed (even with Goodnight Goodnight Sweetheart Sweetheart). You'll also find out what was with Prize Island, who won the World Cup of Chocolate (also what is the best crisps and chew) and Rich's performance on Pointless is roundly mocked. And in a segment that is bound to have a Sachsgate style repercussion on all internet programming, Richard Osman is very rude about Richard's mum, Barbara Herring, who has done nothing wrong, but point out a gross error made by the Egghead presenter (oh, sorry, he doesn't present that show).</p><p><br /></p><p>SUPPORT THE SHOW!</p><p>Check out our website and become a badger and see extra content <a href=\"http://rhlstp.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://rhlstp.co.uk</a></p><p>See details of the RHLSTP tour dates <a href=\"http://richardherring.com/gigs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://richardherring.com/gigs</a></p><p>Buy DVDs and Books at <a href=\"http://gofasterstripe.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://gofasterstripe.com</a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

Only time will tell if he is right again. His guest is the ubiquitous and claustrophobic Rebecca Front, a woman who has appeared in all manner of award-winning TV and Radio roles, but never, it seems, if Richard has been involved in the production too. You'll discover the confusion that can be caused by a mistimed fan shouting out one of your catchphrases, what Patrick Marber is really like to work with, how Morse will never be allowed to die and what happened when Lauren Bacall ate one of her husband's chips. Rich is embarrassed to ask his usual stupid, sexual questions to someone he considers to be purer than the Virgin Mary, especially when her 15 year-old son is in the audience. But he still asks them. Because he is trapped in a nightmare of his own making that he can't escape. And was 'You Can Choose Your Friends' one of the great lost TV series or the worst thing ever to be on television (according to the Evening Standard)?

Who will win the flirtatious/offensive battle of wits this time? You'll find out why she appeared on TV without her underwear, why she kept her first husband's name, and be asked to consider whether she was unreasonable when she refused to tell a journalist her exact address.

But you will learn more about Rich than his interviewee this week, because he was a bit tired and unable to control his mouth or brain. What does he have for breakfast on tour?

They chat about why Stewart Lee fans are 'the worst', whether certain words are unsayable, how splitting yourself into two different comedic personalities can only lead to mental breakdown, if the loss of libido is a blessed release, and what it's like to be mistaken for Ferris Bueller. </p><p><br /></p><p>SUPPORT THE SHOW!</p><p>Check out our website and become a badger and see extra content <a href=\"http://rhlstp.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://rhlstp.co.uk</a></p><p>See details of the RHLSTP tour dates <a href=\"http://richardherring.com/gigs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://richardherring.com/gigs</a></p><p>Buy DVDs and Books at <a href=\"http://gofasterstripe.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://gofasterstripe.com</a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

Richard is still reeling from the lurgy he had in last week's show and his guest is also not very well, it's Mark Gatiss from off of League of Gentlemen and Fear of Fanny. Inevitably there is a lot of discussion about obscure 1970s TV and Tim from The Office being in Sherlock and you'll find out which Doctor Who monster Mark would most like to have sex with. But other questions include: How did Mark prepare for the role that made him famous, the voice of Greg Evigan on TMWRNJ? What characters DIDN'T make it into the League of Gentlemen? What is the biggest fossil that he has ever discovered? Should Rich buy a metal detector? And there's a terrifying real-life ghost story, and more on conspiracy theories. It's gentle and largely dignified, as one would expect from two middle-aged men with colds and bad backs. </p><p><br /></p><p>SUPPORT THE SHOW!</p><p>Check out our website and become a badger and see extra content <a href=\"http://rhlstp.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://rhlstp.co.uk</a></p><p>See details of the RHLSTP tour dates <a href=\"http://richardherring.com/gigs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://richardherring.com/gigs</a></p><p>Buy DVDs and Books at <a href=\"http://gofasterstripe.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://gofasterstripe.com</a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

A new series of RHLSTP and Richard has a whole raft of new emergency questions, to the consternation of his audience who just want to hear the old ones.

His first guest comes from Sarnia - the no-nonsense, no-holds-barred Katherine Ryan. There's some interesting conspiracy theories revolving around Beyonce, what it's like to work in Hooters, the dirty protests at a Crouch End Primary School, the stupidity of American tourists using their children as bear-bait, and as she's from Canada so she's got to have seen a BigFoot, right? </p><p><br /></p><p>SUPPORT THE SHOW!</p><p>Check out our website and become a badger and see extra content <a href=\"http://rhlstp.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://rhlstp.co.uk</a></p><p>See details of the RHLSTP tour dates <a href=\"http://richardherring.com/gigs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://richardherring.com/gigs</a></p><p>Buy DVDs and Books at <a href=\"http://gofasterstripe.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://gofasterstripe.com</a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

You will find out how the team of Uncle got round BBC compliance issues, what to do in St Albans when your dreams have been shattered, where the Bermuda Triangle of the Edinburgh Fringe is, what it's like to perform there, and experience a ham-hand based pun that it's astonishing hasn't been stumbled across before now.

Find out how one of the tallest comedians in the UK snuck one of the smallest into a party, how Richard is planning to win the Gay Celebrity of the Year 2015, who has the tiniest hands in comedy, and if you watch the video you'll get to see the ultimate guide to fingering. In spite of Richard offending the Scottish, the Chinese and Susan's dead grandma, there's no real danger of Richard 'doing a Merchant' and somehow they manage to steer the puerile conversation towards depression and Section 28. Plus which celebrity would you like to stroke your hair as you die?

The pair discuss Harry's career which seems to break the space-time continuum as he's worked with such legends as Abbott and Costello, Jack Benny and Mel Blanc. Why does Derek Smalls wrap his courgette in tin foil and what's his affiliation with Shrewsbury Town? How much creative control do the actors on The Simpsons have over the characters they have helped create? Is stubbornness a pro or a con when trying to make it in show business? What is the Jerry Lewis film, \"The Day The Clown Cried\" really like? Will we hear from Simpsons character Hugh Jass? It's an amazing interview with a driven and hilarious genius man.

Richard is still recovering from his important educational work on International Women's Day, but luckily he isn't going to be taxed by having to speak very much, because his guest is the loquacious and unsinkable Danny Baker. In a show overflowing with content you will find out, amongst much else, about a laserdisc signed by David Bowie, how Danny's amazing dad took umbrage with Harry Enfield, where talcum powder comes from, how to go to Hawaii with no money in the bank and how surviving cancer taught Danny nothing. Is Baker responsible for Bob Marley's demise? Is having no ambition or plan the key to showbiz success? Can you do a consumer affairs programme if you have sympathy with the villains? Is there any point in me trying to list all the stuff that happened? Baker is an amazing force of nature.

Richard chats with his audience and manages to secure himself a TV writing job, as well as marvel at his once IT heavy, bearded male audience being replaced by people who might actually have had sex. Don't worry, the nerds are still there and they're still the best! This week's guest is very tall and has never been told that before, it's sexually-charged comedian and actor Greg Davies. They converse about how W G Grace upstaged Greg's sister's wedding, how Guy Fawkes died and whether he'd welcome a time-travelling penis, how Greg embarrassed himself in front of Rik Mayall in a supermarket and bum-based encounters with doctors. It's raucous and very funny. This is one that might be worth paying the £3.50 to see on video. Not only does Greg have some amazing facial reactions, but Richard carries out one of the dirtybritcom confession fantasies on him. It's very, very sexy. </p><p><br /></p><p>SUPPORT THE SHOW!</p><p>Check out our website and become a badger and see extra content <a href=\"http://rhlstp.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://rhlstp.co.uk</a></p><p>See details of the RHLSTP tour dates <a href=\"http://richardherring.com/gigs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://richardherring.com/gigs</a></p><p>Buy DVDs and Books at <a href=\"http://gofasterstripe.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://gofasterstripe.com</a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

Richard meets his audience, who are predictably much better than last week's to discover a disconcerting leap in the attractiveness and coolness of the people in the front row. Also apparently the queue for the women's toilet was longer than the one for the men's. Something is changing in the world of this podcast and we should all be very afraid. Robert Llewellyn from Red Dwarf and Carpool is the charming and engaging guest. They discuss how the right-on comedy troupe 'The Joeys' got their name, science fiction in which the future is better than the present, a slightly disturbing use of time travelling genitalia, a near fatal car crash, the weirdness of being recognised from behind and how to escape from prison with a piss-drenched shirt.

His guests are Helen Zaltzman and Olly Mann from rival Sony Gold and Silver (but crucially not bronze) winning podcast Answer Me This. They seem to hold some kind of grudge for Richard having made them his enemies in the old Collings and Herrin podcasts, but as Richard was under the thrall of his Herrin character he can't really remember anything about that. Anyway, it's an old-fashioned podclash! The conversation scales the heady heights of time-travelling genitalia, British Forces Broadcasting and how to get sacked from the Lorraine show. Is semen a powerful cologne? What happens if you fall in love with someone in an oil painting? Has Helen married a ghost? Will Richard be bummed to death by the end of the show and how would Olly's bumming sushi carousel work in practice?</p><p><br /></p><p>SUPPORT THE SHOW!</p><p>Check out our website and become a badger and see extra content <a href=\"http://rhlstp.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://rhlstp.co.uk</a></p><p>See details of the RHLSTP tour dates <a href=\"http://richardherring.com/gigs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://richardherring.com/gigs</a></p><p>Buy DVDs and Books at <a href=\"http://gofasterstripe.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://gofasterstripe.com</a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

Tim from The Office might get a mention. Due to Richard getting a bit overtired and overexcitable it goes a bit weird towards the end, but Stephen has achieved a lot of success through the comedy of embarrassment, so it's nice for him to witness some at such close quarters. You are going to enjoy Richard trying to dig himself out the hole he creates and doesn't seem to want to escape.

His guest is one of the world's greatest improvisers, Ross Noble. Richard shows how hard interaction can be by failing to find anything funny to say about the rest of the front row. But luckily from there on in, he is not going to get a word in edgeways as Ross talks non-stop for approaching 100 minutes about TGI Friday's, what it's like to own a tank, convincing his daughter that he's a wizard, why you can't trust Twitter to provide medical advice, why he's more Geordie than Cheryl Cole and how difficult it is to peel potatoes when all your possessions have been destroyed. There are also pyres of burning animals and mad cow leather trousers and criticisms of a hopefully still living Bruce Forsyth.

Richard is stuffed to the gills with giant chocolate buttons and recounts the time he got lost in Buckingham Palace, and still is on the prowl for flies to murder. There is a beef with his guest, Dara O Briain, who still remembers the scathing review that Herring gave him in an online diary back in 1998. And there's more online comment as the pair discuss the sexual fantasies that comedy fans harbour on Dirty Britcom Confessions. There's also chat about how to cope with fatalities on aeroplanes, whether it was worth almost dying on the Zambezi to stop African children being able to play, the paradoxes of digit-based time travel and the truth about goose rescuing myths. And Dara has definitely seen a Bigfoot.

Richard tells a story of a terrifying prediction made by an Armenian fortune teller and is needlessly insulting to a dead broadcaster before introducing this week's guest, Miles Jupp. Although Jupp has appeared in films with George Clooney and Jon Stewart and won plaudits for his stage and TV work, Richard is keen to talk to him about the children's television show, Balamory, and NOTHING ELSE. The audience do not share the host's fascination with this lazily acted, repetitive show for pre-schoolers, but Herring's view is clouded by watching it in a fun of alcoholic despair, so it made him question the very nature of being. Don't worry, the Balamory part only lasts about 25 minutes, so there's still at least an hour of chat about divinity, the Harry Potter franchise, tea tasting and fly fishing, Miles' suspiciously late booking for the podcast and a bizarre phobia of lettuce. You'll also find out some of the good things that terrorists have said and done and witness Richard losing the ability to speak and the will to live as his half-marathon exhaustion finally overcomes him. At least he's not an Imp Pervert. </p><p><br /></p><p>SUPPORT THE SHOW!</p><p>Check out our website and become a badger and see extra content <a href=\"http://rhlstp.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://rhlstp.co.uk</a></p><p>See details of the RHLSTP tour dates <a href=\"http://richardherring.com/gigs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://richardherring.com/gigs</a></p><p>Buy DVDs and Books at <a href=\"http://gofasterstripe.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://gofasterstripe.com</a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

After the infestation of flies that plagued the first two podcasts of the series Richard has been gifted a tennis racquet shaped fly exterminator to try and deal with the issue. There aren't many flies around, but a game member of the audience agrees to be zapped. May she rest in peace. Richard is still a bit sore from running a half-Marathon (sponsor him here - http://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/RichardHerring) in the record breaking time of under 2 hrs 38 minutes, but has a guest who has run 100 metres in just over 12 seconds, Miranda Hart. The pair last appeared together in the short film, A Very British Cult, in which Richard was the STAR, so let's just remember that and none of the stuff that's happened subsequently. They also chat about the different comedy they have created from falling into graves, being mistaken for the wrong gender, laughing at inappropriate times and Miranda's trial for QPR. There's a further exciting evolution for the ham hand/suncream armpit question (which leaves ham and armpits behind) and a treat for fans of the opening credits of some of the series of Not Going Out (that's just Richard then).</p><p><br /></p><p>SUPPORT THE SHOW!</p><p>Check out our website and become a badger and see extra content <a href=\"http://rhlstp.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://rhlstp.co.uk</a></p><p>See details of the RHLSTP tour dates <a href=\"http://richardherring.com/gigs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://richardherring.com/gigs</a></p><p>Buy DVDs and Books at <a href=\"http://gofasterstripe.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://gofasterstripe.com</a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

And Richard hates to disappoint. Luckily he occasionally manages to blunder into discussing Wright's canon of work, from A Fistful of Fingers through Asylum, some ideas for a new series of Spaced, right up to the amazing new film The World's End. But there's still time to talk about what it's like to be taught by both parents, desecrating the graves of your former employers and Rich's ideas to reboot Goodnight Sweetheart and We Will Rock You before Edgar has to dash off to finish off his new film. But is there time to add a shrek?</p><p><br /></p><p>SUPPORT THE SHOW!</p><p>Check out our website and become a badger and see extra content <a href=\"http://rhlstp.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://rhlstp.co.uk</a></p><p>See details of the RHLSTP tour dates <a href=\"http://richardherring.com/gigs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://richardherring.com/gigs</a></p><p>Buy DVDs and Books at <a href=\"http://gofasterstripe.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://gofasterstripe.com</a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

      "description": "<p>RHLSTP #20 - John Lloyd - It's Not Personal. Richard continues with his mission to get to be a guest on QI with top TV producer John Lloyd, though Lloyd seems intent on demonstrating why Herring is too thick to get on the programme with increasingly difficult questions about how many chemicals there are in a carrot, how to define art and if God wears sandals. Or something. It gets brain-hurtingly deep and philosophical as both men attempt to discover the meaning of life. Plus there's some great behind the scenes stories from Not The Nine O'Clock News and Blackadder Goes Forth, Doctor Snuggles and the world of advertising. Does everything happen for a reason? Why does Richard Dawkins waste his time retweeting praise? Where else could you hear a quite clever man being bamboozled by a very clever man, before asking him if he'd prefer a ham hand or a suncream armpit? Nowhere.</p><p><br /></p><p>SUPPORT THE SHOW!</p><p>Check out our website and become a badger and see extra content <a href=\"http://rhlstp.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://rhlstp.co.uk</a></p><p>See details of the RHLSTP tour dates <a href=\"http://richardherring.com/gigs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://richardherring.com/gigs</a></p><p>Buy DVDs and Books at <a href=\"http://gofasterstripe.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://gofasterstripe.com</a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

After last week's headline-grabbing show, Richard feels under pressure to coax revelations from his guest, classicist Mary Beard, but is a bit distracted by transport and atrocity based magazines. Instead he mainly talks about penises in Pompeii, realising that if only he could travel in time that he would be the most popular comedian in that knob-obsessed empire. But all the big historical questions are asked - why is Pan having sex with a goat? What did the people of Herculaneum use to wipe their bums? Where did Ancient Romans sleep? What were Julius Caesar's real last words? Is having sex with a statue the worst thing you can do? Mary also talks about Anus Arsehole Gill and how she fought back against the trolls, what words you can't say on Women's Hour and meeting the Queen with Bruce Forsyth.

Find out what the Spice Girls said to Prince Charles about Prince Albert, the favourite expletive of Lionel Jeffries, why Fabian is the best character in Twelfth Night, why Richard is going to graffiti Fry's grave, which women Steve wants to have sex with, Richard's clunky attempts to audition for QI (will be more of that next week). Richard's clunky attempts to refer to Mr Fry as Steve, whether you have to read The Hobbit to be in The Hobbit, the commercial possibilities of an Ann Widdecombe sex tape, what happened when the Bishop of Bath and Wells went to a prison for young offenders and the insecurity of John Travolta. Some brilliant additional questions by Ben Evans age 12. And properly poignant revelations about mental illness. It is mind-blowing and moving.

And the guests are rising stars and rival non-Sony award nominated podcasters Pappy's (all they've got is a new TV series, the losers). There's plenty of charity human centipede fun to be had with Huge Ackman, bleeding heads, Animal Antics, public nudity and the ham hand question is nearly destroyed, but becomes stronger. There's a half-hearted attempt to put a shrek in it which shows that boat has sailed and too much self-pity.

He has stories of his disastrous audition for Hitchhiker's Guide, being a bully in a china shop and how to quell a Dutch oven. The two small men swap stories about their funny and embarrassing dads, the humane imprisonment of children and discuss how much information you can get into a half hour TV show.

Slightly worse for wear after having lunch with Alice Cooper at the Q Awards, Richard is delighted to welcome a man he thinks might be him from another time stream, David 'Mitch' Mitchell. He's certainly met his match in pedantry and both men accidentally reveal some shocking details about their respective psyches. Never have two men discussed at such length the vagaries of choosing between a ham hand and a sun lotion arm pit. And that is GUARANTEED. The Peep Show stationery cupboard, romantic subterfuge and the Daily Mail readers' internet comments are all up for discussion and we'll find out how an early discussion about Eric Morecambe almost brought the pair to blows. Did Rich really meet some Shreks and a Justin Lee Collins in the street? And what was Tim from The Office like before he became Tim from The Office? Is Richard as bitter and mean as he seems and will he ever get a Googlewhack audience? What's it like to play Aerosmith at table tennis? Will Rich ever forgive his mum for her Brideshead Revisited Alfresco trump? Why don't the audience understand any of Richard's obscure 1980s references? What would you do if God granted you the power of having exactly the same hands as Hermione from Harry Potter? And just how many David Mitchells are there anyway? It's a marathon of a podcast, but there's no cheating and we both stay in it for the whole thing. It'd be nice if there was a happy ending. But there's a slightly unhappy ending.

Rich and his wife have made the ultimate commitment: they've been through their DVD collections and are getting rid of any duplicates. Some lucky audience member is going to win them all! But before that it's time to talk to the star of The Calcium Kid, Peter Serafinowicz. Fans of Star Wars will be creaming out of their arm pits when they hear his tales of working with George Lucas and having to pay to go the premiere. Astonishing stuff. Rich provides an alternate reading of Darth Maul for the next director's cut. There's talk of zombies and Tony Wilson, Terrance Stamp and Will Arnett and lots of inside gossip about working on US and UK TV. And someone is going to win a copy of East is East. C'mon it doesn't get better than that.</p><p><br /></p><p>SUPPORT THE SHOW!</p><p>Check out our website and become a badger and see extra content <a href=\"http://rhlstp.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://rhlstp.co.uk</a></p><p>See details of the RHLSTP tour dates <a href=\"http://richardherring.com/gigs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://richardherring.com/gigs</a></p><p>Buy DVDs and Books at <a href=\"http://gofasterstripe.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://gofasterstripe.com</a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

With the world in shock about the accusations about an ex-BBC employee with long hair and an odd home life who raised money for charity, Richard is keeping his head down, but he is joined by the slightly odd men behind such hits as The League of Gentlemen and Psychoville, Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton. They chat about the unlikely character of Davey from Henry IV part II, what it's like to work with Woody Allen, as well as a RHLSTP exclusive - the name of the duo's next TV project. Find out where the inspiration for Papa Lazarou and the Psychoville Tina Turner tribute act came from, and the ghostly real-life occurrences that Reece has experienced. If you've ever wondered whether this pair would prefer a ham hand or a sun cream armpit then wonder no more. Have they seen a Big Foot? You'll have to listen to find out. Although if you don't have time to listen then the answer is no. This was a lot of fun to be a part of. I think you will like it.

But then no one else would ask him about self-fellatio either. There's a lesson in medieval history, protesting dwarves and criticism of a film scene involving comedy rape (from a man happy to discuss necrophiliac cloaca violation) and an attempt to drive a wedge between Frost and Pegg in the hope that Herring can appear in the next film in the Cornetto trilogy instead of Frost.

Jonathan Ross fell asleep whilst interviewing Higson, so Rich has his work cut out for him in this long chat with the Frome born comedian and author and ex-popstar. But only a very few bits of this long chat could be used by Felicity to induce insomniacs into the arms of Morpheus as we examine the career of the man responsible for Loadsamoney, Swiss Toni and Young James Bond. Funnily enough we prove that pretty much anything can become a catchphrase and determine as best we can who is worse, Hitler or Ricky Gervais. Both comedians are hoping to get a cheese named after them, but only one of them has won the Chortle Internet Award and is thus the best. It's 100 minutes of fun, so more like Fist than Fast. And some of the running jokes will only make sense if you were one of the brave few who made it down to see the secret (astonishingly brilliant) first half.<b>﻿</b></p><p><br /></p><p>SUPPORT THE SHOW!</p><p>Check out our website and become a badger and see extra content <a href=\"http://rhlstp.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://rhlstp.co.uk</a></p><p>See details of the RHLSTP tour dates <a href=\"http://richardherring.com/gigs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://richardherring.com/gigs</a></p><p>Buy DVDs and Books at <a href=\"http://gofasterstripe.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://gofasterstripe.com</a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

      "description": "<p>RHLSTP #3 Francesca Martinez. Rich is angry about the Fringe programme censoring the entry for Talking C*ck (what can that word be?), but luckily Francesca Martinez is on hand to talk about the power of language, whether Ben Elton is stuck in the 80s and whether the concept of 'normal' exists anywhere but on a washing machine. She also reveals how Richard attempted to corrupt her in 2003 in Melbourne, but luckily she's still talking to him and speculates on whether Jonathan Ross has ever tried to suck his own penis. And Richard recounts the embarrassing interactions that he's had with his childhood hero Ben Elton and how awkward Sunday's gig for SCOPE (not what Elton calls it) at the Hammersmith Apollo on May 20th might be. Someone in the audience is going to win tickets to see the Stewart Lee podcast but what are the chances of them being related to someone on stage?</p><p><br /></p><p>SUPPORT THE SHOW!</p><p>Check out our website and become a badger and see extra content <a href=\"http://rhlstp.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://rhlstp.co.uk</a></p><p>See details of the RHLSTP tour dates <a href=\"http://richardherring.com/gigs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://richardherring.com/gigs</a></p><p>Buy DVDs and Books at <a href=\"http://gofasterstripe.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://gofasterstripe.com</a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

      "description": "<p>RHLSTP #2 Jonathan Ross (with guest appearance by Francesca Martinez). How did Rich manage this? He's got a proper TV star and interviewer on his show and the pressure is making him tongue-tied, but at least he can pronounce the letter R. There's plenty to chat about from It Ain't 'Alf Hot Mum to the most popular piece of Paul Ross merchandise on Amazon to how on Earth did potty mouth Ross get an OBE? There's so much to discuss that Richard forgets to ask Ross if he's ever tried to suck his own cock? Luckily later on Twitter Jonathan wrote, 'No, I suspect I could have reached, but never been that hungry!' Another episode recorded tonight will be available later this week.</p><p><br /></p><p>SUPPORT THE SHOW!</p><p>Check out our website and become a badger and see extra content <a href=\"http://rhlstp.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://rhlstp.co.uk</a></p><p>See details of the RHLSTP tour dates <a href=\"http://richardherring.com/gigs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://richardherring.com/gigs</a></p><p>Buy DVDs and Books at <a href=\"http://gofasterstripe.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://gofasterstripe.com</a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

      "description": "<p>The podcast with the most unwieldy acronym yet RHLSTP (rhlstp) starts with a bang with flame-haired multi-talented genius Tim Minchin chatting about self-penetration, bad reviews, whether Karma has payback and if you can choose your own songs on Desert Island Discs. There's chat about the best revenge to take on a critic, eating face meat, eating lip balm, the effect of shower gel on genitals and the homoerotic subtext of a man helping another man put on his tie. Find out who should really be playing Matilda on stage, how Rich would improve it and his other ideas of which Roald Dahl stories Tim could copy. Also Judas, Jesus and whether atheists and religious people can ever be friends. It's an hour and twenty minutes of incite and silliness, but if you want it to be less then just stop it when you get bored.</p><p><br /></p><p>SUPPORT THE SHOW!</p><p>Check out our website and become a badger and see extra content <a href=\"http://rhlstp.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://rhlstp.co.uk</a></p><p>See details of the RHLSTP tour dates <a href=\"http://richardherring.com/gigs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://richardherring.com/gigs</a></p><p>Buy DVDs and Books at <a href=\"http://gofasterstripe.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://gofasterstripe.com</a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.
