We chat about the changes to the starting XI, a difficult start for the Gunners before getting on top, a European handball to give us a penalty in the first half, and the enigma that is Mikel Merino finding the back of the net twice. We also talk about an interesting tactical decision from Mikel Arteta, keeping yet another clean sheet to equal an incredibly long-standing club record, Max Dowman becoming the youngest ever Champions League player, and lots more – including the winners of last week's book competition.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>Highbury is published by Orion – <a href=\"https://www.orionbooks.co.uk/titles/jon-spurling/highbury/9781409153061/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.orionbooks.co.uk/titles/jon-spurling/highbury/9781409153061/</a> – and if possible please order the book via your local independent bookstore!</p><br /><p><strong>Get extra bonus content and help support Arseblog by becoming an Arseblog Member on Patreon: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/arseblog\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>https://www.patreon.com/arseblog</strong></a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

The goals came from Viktor Gyokeres and Declan Rice, and the Gunners probably should have scored more. The chat about the first 45 minutes which won the game for Arsenal, the 'non-event' second half, but which is a demonstration of the control this team is capable of, and yet another clean sheet without a shot on target. There's a wider discussion about the way this side is operating this season, questions about Rice and his midfield impact, Myles Lewis-Skelly with real competition at left-back, Leandro Trossard causing some frustration, rotation for the Champions League this week, our disciplinary record this season, and loads more.</p><br /><p><strong>Get extra bonus content and help support Arseblog by becoming an Arseblog Member on Patreon: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/arseblog\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>https://www.patreon.com/arseblog</strong></a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

We also answer listener questions about Gabriel Jesus and his role this season, striker alternatives to Viktor Gyokeres, which Arsenal player we'd like to get on the podcast, and lots more.</p><br /><p><strong>Get extra bonus content and help support Arseblog by becoming an Arseblog Member on Patreon: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/arseblog\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>https://www.patreon.com/arseblog</strong></a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

The signing and presentation of Eberechi Eze almost overshadowed what was a very impressive win for Mikel Arteta's side – so we chat first about the arrival of the former Crystal Palace and how it has made us all feel (answer: very good and hahaha at you know who). Then we discuss the 5-0 win over Leeds, two goals for Jurrien Timber and two very important ones for Viktor Gyokeres, the debut of 15 year old Max Dowman and his impact from the bench, and other snippets from what was a great first home game of the season. Part 2 begins with transfer news as we're linked with another left-back, before we answer questions about the future of Gabriel Martinelli, whether Gabriel Jesus can play a role this season as he nears a comeback, left-footed Hale End graduates, our ongoing injury issues, a possible front 3 at Anfield, and lots more.</p><br /><p><strong>Get extra bonus content and help support Arseblog by becoming an Arseblog Member on Patreon: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/arseblog\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>https://www.patreon.com/arseblog</strong></a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

We discuss what the player can bring to Arsenal, the inspirational nature of his journey having been released by the club when he was 13, the options it provides Mikel Arteta, and of course the reaction from the other side which has been downright hilarious.

There's also discussion of midfield, the need for more creativity, some positives with the return of Gabriel and Jurrien Timber, and Max Dowman continuing to impress.

In the first, we chat about the confirmation of Martin Zubimendi's transfer and what he'll bring to the team; the big striker news as it appears Arsenal have decided to sign Viktor Gyokeres from Sporting; reported interest in Chelsea's Noni Madueke and how that stacks up; Leandro Trossard linked with a move to Fenerbahce; and Takehiro Tomiyasu's slightly unexpected departure.</p><br /><p><strong>Part 2 begins at 45'05 and runs until 1:13'09</strong>. We discuss the fact that Thomas Partey has been charged by the Met Police with rape and sexual assault. We understand this might be difficult for some listeners, so you can skip if it's not something you want to listen to, but we talk about the news being public, the way Arsenal handled the situation as a whole, the responsibility of those at the top of the club to uphold values, and how we felt about a possible contract extension.

We love you, but a week off isn't too much to ask! Talk to you when we get back. ❤️</p><br /><p><strong>Get extra bonus content and help support Arseblog by becoming an Arseblog Member on Patreon: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/arseblog\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>https://www.patreon.com/arseblog</strong></a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

After a difficult first half in which David Raya saved our bacon more than once, Declan Rice's second half goal was enough for three points. We discuss the turnaround, the importance of winning for finishing in second place and ensuring Champions League football for next season, as well as the manager's post-game comments on the pitch and the message he was keen to send. Then we take listener questions about a big summer ahead in the transfer market and how up front the club have been about what they want to do, the need for greater rotation from Arteta next season, Kieran Tierney's Arsenal career after he made his final home appearance, and lots more.</p><br /><p><strong>Get extra bonus content and help support Arseblog by becoming an Arseblog Member on Patreon: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/arseblog\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>https://www.patreon.com/arseblog</strong></a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

Lianne chats with Tim about the camaraderie that underpinned the team, the role of then assistant manager Emma Hayes on the UWCL campaign, how Arsenal responded to their best player Kelly Smith being suspended for both legs of the final and how the team adapted to being huge underdogs against Umea. Lianne also talks about her affection for the club all these years later, her pride at seeing the quadruple winning team on the side of the Emirates and her hope that Arsenal can do it again in Lisbon against Barcelona.</p><br /><p>Get extra bonus content and help support Arseblog's award winning coverage of Arsenal Women by becoming an Arseblog Member on Patreon: <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/arseblog\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>https://www.patreon.com/arseblog</strong></a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

We start with the good stuff, in particular the goalscoring return for Bukayo Saka, and a really bright performance from Gabriel Martinelli. Then we discuss the injuries to Gabriel and Jurrien Timber, as well as pre-game news about Ben White, and where that leaves us going into the Real Madrid games. What are the options available to Mikel Arteta, who tried to put a brave face on things after the game? And why are we sustaining so many injuries?</p><br /><p>There's also some detail of our April charity drive: we'll be donating <strong>100%</strong> of our Patreon revenue to good causes, including the Arsenal Foundation, as well as supporting our friends at ArsenalVision Podcast as they launch their annual fundraiser - <a href=\"https://justgiving.com/page/avp2025\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://justgiving.com/page/avp2025</a></p><br /><p>Follow Andrew on BlueSky - <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/aallensport.arseblog.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://bsky.app/profile/aallensport.arseblog.com</a></p><br /><p><strong>Get extra bonus content and help support Arseblog by becoming an Arseblog Member on Patreon: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/arseblog\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>https://www.patreon.com/arseblog</strong></a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

Then we answer listener questions about Jurrien Timber and his contribution this season, Arteta's preferred striker profile ahead of the summer, our Champions League hopes, a Chelsea Mount Rushmore, some <em>#angeout</em>, and lots more.</p><br /><p><strong>Get extra bonus content and help support Arseblog by becoming an Arseblog Member on Patreon: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/arseblog\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>https://www.patreon.com/arseblog</strong></a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

Arsenal failed to turn first half dominance into chances, and fell behind to a Bruno Fernandes free kick, before Declan Rice equalised late in the second half. We analyse the performance, our continuing issues when we face a low block and how much that is actually a consequence of how we play rather than an opposition tactic. There's also discussion of the heroics of David Raya as the Gunners keeper made a string of saves to ensure we didn't lose the game, Rice's goal and fantastic tackle, Kieran Tierney's cameo as an attacking sub, as well as listener questions about Mikel Arteta and his post-match interview, our lack of threat from direct free kicks, the remainder of the season from a Premier League perspective, the imminent appointment of Andrea Berta as Sporting Director, and lots more.</p><br /><p><strong>Get extra bonus content and help support Arseblog by becoming an Arseblog Member on Patreon: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/arseblog\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>https://www.patreon.com/arseblog</strong></a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

We discuss Myles Lewis-Skelly's good fortune in not picking up a second yellow card, and whether this is something that needs careful management from Mikel Arteta. Then there are listener questions about which flavour of Madrid we'd like to play if we navigate the second leg without incident, Nwaneri and MLS possibly being called up by England, Nathan Butler-Oyedeji in the second leg, Ben White's return, and lots more.</p><br /><p><strong>Get extra bonus content and help support Arseblog by becoming an Arseblog Member on Patreon: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/arseblog\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>https://www.patreon.com/arseblog</strong></a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

      "description": "<p>In this episode we look back at the 1-1 draw with Brighton on Saturday evening. A solid first half saw us go in 1-0 up at the break thanks to Ethan Nwaneri's excellent goal, but a contentious second half penalty provided the home with the equaliser. We analyse the decision to award the spot kick, as well as what Arsenal did/didn't do afterwards as a depleted squad struggled to find a winner. That leads to a big discussion about the January window in the context of our league position and the other competitions we're in, as well as listener questions about the two cup ties we face this week, whether Arsenal are 'boring' this season, time-wasting and yellow cards, Dani Olmo's situation, and lots more.</p><br /><p><strong>Get extra bonus content and help support Arseblog by becoming an Arseblog Member on Patreon: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/arseblog\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>https://www.patreon.com/arseblog</strong></a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

Then we answer listener questions about who plays right back against Brighton with Jurrien Timber suspended and if we might make a sneaky defensive signing in January, William Saliba's contract with Real Madrid reportedly sniffing around, Mikel Merino and his role in the team, contract extensions for our veteran central midfielders, and lots more.</p><br /><p><strong>Get extra bonus content and help support Arseblog by becoming an Arseblog Member on Patreon: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/arseblog\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>https://www.patreon.com/arseblog</strong></a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

We chat about the starting line-up in the absence of Bukayo Saka, the goal we scored through Kai Havertz, and how in a massively dominant first half we didn't create a lot of chances to score. That then leads to a wider discussion about how this is a developing trend for Arsenal, and whether or not the manager's outlook on the game is a factor. Does he sacrifice attacking threat for defensive stability? We also talk about the second half, the fine margins, and three important points, before we answer listener questions – starting with Saka's injury and what the club need to do in the January window (including some potential candidates for a transfer). There's also stuff on Myles Lewis-Skelly, using subs in the hectic period, Martin Odegaard's form and lots more.</p><br /><p><strong>EXCLUSIVE</strong>&nbsp;NordVPN&nbsp;Deal&nbsp;➼&nbsp;<a href=\"https://nordvpn.com/arseblog\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>https://nordvpn.com/arseblog</strong></a>&nbsp;Try it risk-free now with a 30-day money-back guarantee!</p><br /><p><strong>Get extra bonus content and help support Arseblog by becoming an Arseblog Member on Patreon: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/arseblog\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>https://www.patreon.com/arseblog</strong></a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

We begin with the decision to start Myles Lewis-Skelly, his role in the opening goal, and assess what was a very promising performance from the 18 year old, before discussing the first half chances which should have seen the Gunners have the gamn won by the break. Then there's analysis of Monaco's second half improvement, the change that really shifted the dynamic back in our favour, the impact yet again of Bukayo Saka and lots more.</p><br /><p>Then I chat to David Squires, whose weekly Guardian cartoons have entertained us all down the years. He has a new book out, so we chat about some his process, how the madness of football provides a constant mine for his creative talents, and some of his Arsenal drawings.

We chat about the impact it has had on competitiveness in the game, why Roman Abramovich's arrival at Chelsea in 2003 opened a Pandora's Box, the Premier League's culpability, how FIFA and UEFA have failed to safeguard the game and instead jumped on the gravy train, and lots more.

We chat about the strength of the team selection, a long overdue goal for Gabriel Jesus, and of course another exciting display from Ethan Nwaneri which he capped with an incredible goal. We touch on reasons why Mikel Arteta might still be cautious about overplaying the 17 year old, as well as the performance of others such as Raheem Sterling and Jakub Kiwior, before we talk about how winning this competition might not be top of anyone's priority list but would still be important and beneficial for the club and the fans.</p><br /><p>Find The Chronicles of a Gooner on YouTube here - <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@arsenalpodcast\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/@arsenalpodcast</a> – or in all the usual podcast places.</p><br /><p><strong>Get extra bonus content and help support Arseblog by becoming an Arseblog Member on Patreon: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/arseblog\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>https://www.patreon.com/arseblog</strong></a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

We chat about the impact on Bukayo Saka on his return to the team, with an outstanding goal, and Arsenal's response to the Liverpool equaliser. Mikel Merino gave us a deserved lead at the break, but in the second half the performance levels dropped a bit so we analyse the reasons for that, key of which was the loss of Gabriel, as well as finishing the game with a very makeshift back-four. We also discuss the second Liverpool goal, some of the officiating decisions, and how to view the result in the context of the season so far. Then there are questions about what kind of team to pick for the Carabao Cup, media narratives, the framing of Mikel Arteta's style as a manager, and lots more.</p><br /><p><strong>Get extra bonus content and help support Arseblog by becoming an Arseblog Member on Patreon: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/arseblog\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>https://www.patreon.com/arseblog</strong></a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

In the second half, Tim and Jamie take your questions on the midfield, whether Kafaji should have an increased role now, Steph Catley at centre-back, the goalkeeper situation, whether Arsenal need a 'clean break' with a new manager ASAP and then Tim and Jamie consider Manu Zinsberger's recent LinkedIn post and consider the lines between criticism and abuse.</p><br /><p>Get extra bonus content and help support Arseblog by becoming an Arseblog Member on Patreon: <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/arseblog\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.patreon.com/arseblog</a></p><br /><p>If you are a regular listener please consider giving the show a review in your favourite podcast app, thanks!</p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

Tim and Jamie talk about the defending on the goals conceded and whether a lack of confidence in attack had an impact on the result with more than one proven player low on confidence. In the second half, Tim and Jamie deal with listener questions on Rosa Kafaji and the lack of integration for young players, on Clare Wheatley's role and whether more communication from 'upstairs' is needed at the club and on the delicate balance between rotation and trying and failing to find partnerships that work.</p><br /><p>Get extra bonus content and help support Arseblog by becoming an Arseblog Member on Patreon: <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/arseblog\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>https://www.patreon.com/arseblog</strong></a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

We chat about the way the game turned, the Gunners response, an extraordinary goalkeeping display which played a big part in frustrating us after what was a very intense attacking performance from Mikel Arteta's team. There's discussion of those aspects, how the two full-backs were so important to that, the team's mentality, plus listener questions about Gabriel Jesus, Pep Guardiola's reaction to Arteta's comments, some recently departed young players, Ethan Nwaneri starting against Southampton and lots more.</p><br /><p><strong>Get extra bonus content and help support Arseblog by becoming an Arseblog Member on Patreon: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/arseblog\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>https://www.patreon.com/arseblog</strong></a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

We chat about missed opportunities, elements of the performance that weren't perfect, and a team that fights for each other in every aspect of the game. There's discussion of key moments, not least Gabriel's goal, and the importance of winning this one with the players we had available.

It wasn't a great performance, but Leandro Trossard's first half goal was enough for all three points and to keep the title push going until the final day. We chat about why the attacking performance was so inhibited, but there's praise for the way we defended against a United side that offered little to threaten us. Underlying it all though, was a sense of pre-game dread, and we discuss that, and the prospect of the final day, as well as answering listener questions about Spurs game against Man City on Tuesday, William Saliba, and much more.</p><br /><p><strong>Get extra bonus content and help support Arseblog by becoming an Arseblog Member on Patreon: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/arseblog\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>https://www.patreon.com/arseblog</strong></a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

They discuss the win over Manchester City and how it feels to give Chelsea a lifeline back into the WSL title race, then there is in-depth discussion about the futures of Vivianne Miedema and Stina Blackstenius, whose current contracts expire in the summer. Tim and Aidan then talk about the other profiles of player Arsenal might need this summer, especially given their goal scoring record which has been far inferior to Chelsea and Manchester City this season. They discuss whether 25 players is too many for a season and the consistent rotation of the number 10 position and whether it needs greater clarity.</p><br /><p>You can follow Aidan on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/@BeltransMole\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">@BeltransMole</a> and Tim <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stillmanator\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">@Stillmanator</a></p><br /><p>Get extra bonus content and help support Arseblog by becoming an Arseblog Member on Patreon: <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/arseblog\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>https://www.patreon.com/arseblog</strong></a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

The Gunners produced a dominant first half, but it was a late first half penalty that gave us the lead at the break. We analyse the key moments of the opening 45, from the potential red card to the missed chances to the award of the spot kick. Then we look at a second half where Leandro Trossard scored again, but was there a touch of good fortune about Bournemouth's disallowed goal which would have made the game more uncomfortable? Declan Rice's performance merited a goal and he got it late on, and we also answer listener questions about whether he should be used as an 8 more than a 6, potential changes to the coaching staff, the Gabriel Jesus story James wrote last week, some <em>#ANGEOUT</em>, and lots more.</p><br /><p><strong>Get extra bonus content and help support Arseblog by becoming an Arseblog Member on Patreon: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/arseblog\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>https://www.patreon.com/arseblog</strong></a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

Despite not being at our best, we were 3-0 up at the break, and we discuss the goals we scored, and how we exploited the lack of opposition preparation and awareness – particularly from set-pieces. Ben White and Declan Rice had some fun in that regard. We also chat about the chances they had up the other end, including a disallowed goal, before moving onto the second half. There's focus on David Raya's mistake and the reaction to it from him and his teammates, conceding the late penalty and how it made for an awful, nerve-wracking last 10 minutes, but underlying it all is the fact we won, took three points, and Spurs have crap trumpets. Then there are listener questions about Kai Havertz, Bukayo Saka's reaction to abuse from the stands, Thomas Partey's future and lots more.</p><br /><p><strong>Get extra bonus content and help support Arseblog by becoming an Arseblog Member on Patreon: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/arseblog\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>https://www.patreon.com/arseblog</strong></a><strong> – this month we're donating every penny of our Patreon revenue to UNICEF, so you get great content and help kids all around the world too.</strong></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

      "description": "<p>In this episode we look back at Arsenal's impressive 3-0 win over Brighton on Saturday evening. We talk about the risk/reward nature of the Gunners approach against this particular opposition, and how having adjusted slightly early in the first half, the opposition threat was more or less negated. We analyse the penalty incident and the goals we scored, the man of the match performance from Kai Havertz, and the way we settled into a comfortable defensive system after going 2-0 up. There's also chat about Leandro Trossard scoring against his former club, what this result means in the context of the weekend's results, as well as listener questions about how Havertz's development at centre-forward might influence summer transfer business, left-back for Bayern and Jakub Kiwior, Gabriel's Player of the Season credentials, Martin Odegaard's importance and lots more.</p><br /><p><strong>Get extra bonus content and help support Arseblog by becoming an Arseblog Member on Patreon: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/arseblog\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>https://www.patreon.com/arseblog</strong></a><strong> – this month we're donating every penny of our Patreon revenue to UNICEF, so you get great content and help kids all around the world too.</strong></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

There's discussion of set-piece goals, Bukayo Saka from the spot, Leandro Trossard's impressive stats, and of course the contribution of Declan Rice with two assists and a brilliant goal against his former club. We also chat about Ethan Nwaneri, goal difference and ruthlessness before answering listener questions about Rice in the pantheon of the Premier League's most expensive signings, Gabriel Jesus, how the winter break has helped us improve, OLEing, and lots more.</p><br /><p><strong>Get extra bonus content and help support Arseblog by becoming an Arseblog Member on Patreon: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/arseblog\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>https://www.patreon.com/arseblog</strong></a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

We chat about how we found joy, especially in the second half; conceding a late goal to add some nerves to the ending; and the heated discussion between Ben White and Oleksandr Zinchenko after the final whistle. Then we have listener questions about football terminology, players shifting positions in-game, why it is we concede so often to the opposition's first chance, Albert Sambi Lokonga, and lots more.</p><br /><p><strong>Get extra bonus content and help support Arseblog by becoming an Arseblog Member on Patreon: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/arseblog\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>https://www.patreon.com/arseblog</strong></a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

We analyse a first half in which Arsenal played well and did a lot right, but failed to make the most of the chances they created. It's a familiar theme, and one which came back to haunt us as late goals from the Mugsmashers condemned us to an FA Cup exit at a frustratingly early stage again. We chat about how Arsenal didn't make the most of the first half, examine the chances we could have done better with, before a much more even second half. There's discussion of substitutes and the timing of their arrivals, the goals we conceded, and the big problem that's so obvious to everyone – but is 'Buy a striker?' too simplistic a solution in January? Then we have questions about Emile Smith Rowe, defending set-pieces, xG variation, Eddie Nketiah and lots more.</p><br /><p><strong>Get extra bonus content and help support Arseblog by becoming an Arseblog Member on Patreon: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/arseblog\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>https://www.patreon.com/arseblog</strong></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

Then we answer some questions about Gabriel Martinelli, William Saliba, biased punditry, and a couple of festive ones too, before we play out with a musical number.</p><br /><p>Merry Christmas everyone.</p><br /><p><strong>Get extra bonus content and help support Arseblog by becoming an Arseblog Member on Patreon: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/arseblog\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>https://www.patreon.com/arseblog</strong></a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

We discuss Arsenal's control versus cutting edge, the perception of our attack this season, the team selection and Brentford's approach, Aaron Ramsdale's horror moment and Declan Rice's incredible recovery. We obviously chat about the late winner scored by Kai Havertz, what it means for him (at last), and what it meant to take three points and go top of the table. We then have listener questions about the way Mikel Arteta deal with post-game questions about Ramsdale, Leandro Trossard in the left 8 position, reporters trying (badly) to get Thomas Frank to criticise Arsenal's celebrations, the offside rule, and lots more.</p><br /><p><strong>Get extra bonus content and help support Arseblog by becoming an Arseblog Member on Patreon: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/arseblog\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>https://www.patreon.com/arseblog</strong></a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

Overall it's a great result, and we focus first on the positives, which include the brilliance of Gabriel Jesus, Gabriel Martinelli's debut Champions League goal, the ever-growing influence of Declan Rice, and the resurgence of Takehiro Tomiyasu. We then discuss some things which weren't quite as good, including Martin Odegaard's dip in form, David Raya's short passing, and Eddie Nketiah's substitute performance – but it's easier to chat about those things with three very good points in our back pocket.</p><br /><p><strong>Get extra bonus content and help support Arseblog by becoming an Arseblog Member on Patreon: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/arseblog\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>https://www.patreon.com/arseblog</strong></a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

We chat about Arsenal's control of this game (and others this season), and whether it comes at a cost to our attacking play. We then discuss the Gabriel Martinelli disallowed goal, Fabio Vieira's selection in midfield, the set-piece play and finish from Leandro Trossard which won the game, before moving on to the big talking point – David Raya starting over Aaron Ramsdale. Mikel Arteta's post-game comments about that decision were fascinating – are we about to see a new era of goalkeeping rotation, or was this simply a changing of the guard. Then there are listener questions about Declan Rice's influence, hoodoo games we'd like to win, Eddie Nketiah/Gabriel Jesus and the centre-forward role, winning lots of corners, and loads more.</p><br /><p><strong>Get extra bonus content and help support Arseblog by becoming an Arseblog Member on Patreon: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/arseblog\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>https://www.patreon.com/arseblog</strong></a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

First, Alex gives her insight on the signing of Laia Codina from Barcelona before Tim and Alex segue into talking about the Women's World Cup, Alex's experiences of covering the tournament from Perth, Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney, how the 'mid-tier' nations are closing the gap to the elite in international football and how Spain won the tournament in spite of their coach and the RFEF. Tim and Alex finish by talking about the ongoing situation with RFEF President Luis Rubiales and his refusal to go quietly.</p><br /><p>Alex wrote a piece for the Guardian recently covering the history of internal conflict between the RFEF and the Spanish players which we would point you to to give the conversation its full context - read it here: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/26/spain-luis-rubiales-football-federation-president-jenni-hermoso\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">A revolution 40 years in the making: how the Spanish women’s team fought back</a></p><br /><p>You can follow Tim on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stillmanator\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">@Stillmanator</a> : Follow Alex <a href=\"https://twitter.com/alexibaceta23\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">@alexibaceta23</a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

We examine the possible reasons, as well as Arsenal's response which, after some time to reflect, was better than you might think. We chat about the goals we scored, Fabio Vieira's excellent impact from the bench, and then how defensive carelessness cost us for 10 man Fulham's equaliser – leading to the frustration of dropped points. We then have questions about Saka, emotions, who to play left 8 in the next game, Emile Smith Rowe, and lots more.</p><br /><p>Get your Bukayo Saka t-shirt here – use the code ARSEBLOG to get 10% off: <a href=\"https://www.astorelike94.co.uk/product/sakira-manga-gunners-bootleg-away-t-shirt-black-gold\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.astorelike94.co.uk/product/sakira-manga-gunners-bootleg-away-t-shirt-black-gold</a></p><br /><p><strong>Get extra bonus content and help support Arseblog by becoming an Arseblog Member on Patreon: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/arseblog\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>https://www.patreon.com/arseblog</strong></a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

We begin by talking about the continued absence of Gabriel from the starting line-up, and wonder if the tactical rationale stacks up 100%. Then we move onto the game itself, Arsenal's first half chances, winning the penalty in the second half, and then the dismissal of Takehiro Tomiyasu – based around perceived time-wasting rules, and a ludicrous second yellow card. The defensive rearguard action was enjoyable in the end but could we have had more control when down to 10 men? We also answer listener questions about Kai Havertz's role, a possible reintegration for Nicolas Pepe, Leandro Trossard's minimal role so far this season, Declan Rice, selling players, and lots more.</p><br /><p><strong>Get extra bonus content and help support Arseblog by becoming an Arseblog Member on Patreon: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/arseblog\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>https://www.patreon.com/arseblog</strong></a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

We couldn't find a third, so Forest getting one back made things a bit nervy, but the important thing was to take all three points and we did – even if there's obviously room for improvement.

Then there are reflections on the season as a whole, and the way the fans stayed to show their appreciation, as well as questions about the ovation received by Mikel Arteta, the fact we didn't get any red cards this season, Eddie Nketiah's contribution, more on Xhaka and his departure, a quick guess at how many signings we might make, and lots more besides.</p><br /><p><strong>Get extra bonus content and help support Arseblog by becoming an Arseblog Member on Patreon: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/arseblog\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>https://www.patreon.com/arseblog</strong></a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

Then we answer listener questions about Jakub Kiwior, the time-wasting/shithousery aspect of the performance, adding experience to the youthful aspects of the team, Kieran Tierney's impressive cameo, and lots more, including magpie facts.</p><br /><p><strong>Get extra bonus content and help support Arseblog by becoming an Arseblog Member on Patreon: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/arseblog\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>https://www.patreon.com/arseblog</strong></a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

First Tim chats to Arsenal Women Supporters Club Treasurer Brian Kelly to talk about how the supporters club have worked with Arsenal for improvements on ticketing, dedicated Arsenal sections at away games and creating a sense of community among the supporters. Then Tim chats to Eve, Lauren and Dalia from AWFC Home and Away to talk about writing player chants, the burgeoning social scene around home and away games and creating a women's football fan culture that isn't just focused on families and children.</p><br /><p>Tim also took his dictaphone into the Meadow Park North Bank on a chilly Wednesday evening to sample some of the aural delights of this growing community.</p><br /><p>You can follow the Arsenal Women's Supporters Club <a href=\"https://twitter.com/arsenalwomensc\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">@arsenalwomensc</a> and you can follow AWFC Home and Away <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AWFCHomeAway\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">@AWFCHomeAway</a></p><br /><p>Get extra bonus content and help support Arseblog by becoming an Arseblog Member on Patreon: <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/arseblog\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>https://www.patreon.com/arseblog</strong></a></p><p><br /></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

Arsenal dominated the first half in particular, and we discuss the goals we scored, the control and composure in possession, the footballing IQ of the players to be able to do that, and the impact of Leandro Trossard as he grabbed a hat-trick of assists. We also chat about the Fire and Ice of Gabriel and William Saliba at the back, and the return of Gabriel Jesus after three months out with injury. After that we have questions about strikers and the decisions Mikel Arteta will have to make, Bukayo Saka looking a little tired, Emile Smith Rowe's role for the rest of the season, the songs being sung, OLEs, corner routines and loads more.</p><br /><p><strong>Get extra bonus content and help support Arseblog by becoming an Arseblog Member on Patreon: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/arseblog\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>https://www.patreon.com/arseblog</strong></a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

Their first goal didn't look pretty and it could easily have been 3-1 before we made it 2-2. Still, we made 6 changes, had a lot of players missing through injury and illness, and the tie is very much alive for the second leg in London next week.</p><br /><p>Follow Andrew <a href=\"http://twitter.com/AAllenSport\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">@AAllenSport</a></p><br /><p><strong>Get extra bonus content and help support Arseblog by becoming an Arseblog Member on Patreon: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/arseblog\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>https://www.patreon.com/arseblog</strong></a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

On a day of huge emotion, we try to analyse the game as best we can, from team selection, to going behind, then 2-0 down, and afterwards the incredible comeback culminating in Reiss Nelson's late, great winner. But we're fans too, so we talk about how it feels and what it means for the supporters, as well as the players, manager and everybody associated with the club in a season which promises so much. There's a lot going on, plus questions about Nelson's future, Fabio Vieira, defensive and set-piece issues, the emotional elements of games and performances like this, and so much more.</p><p><strong>Get extra bonus content and help support Arseblog by becoming an Arseblog Member on Patreon: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/arseblog\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>https://www.patreon.com/arseblog</strong></a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

There's discussion about why Leicester were so toothless for 90 minutes, and how these are the kinds of games you need to win to challenge for a title.

We discuss a first half that was below par, and the goals we conceded, as well as Bukayo Saka's brilliant equaliser. There's some speculation about what might have been said at half-time to spark a much better second half – collectively, and from certain individuals. Then the focus is on a remarkable last 20 minutes, chatting about the Martin Odegaard miss, chances at both ends, before an incredible flourish in the 6 minutes of injury time. Former Arsenal keeper Emi Martinez brought about much of that extra time, and paid the price with a superb headed own goal from Jorginho's shot, before Gabriel Martinelli sealed the deal. We have a go at all the fun stuff, the celebrations, the recriminations, as well as answering listener questions about protection for Saka, substitutes, Eddie Nketiah, Kieran Tierney, the team developing an edge and LOADS more.</p><br /><p><strong>Get extra bonus content and help support Arseblog by becoming an Arseblog Member on Patreon: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/arseblog\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>https://www.patreon.com/arseblog</strong></a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

      "description": "<p>In this episode we look back on the 3-1 defeat to Man City on Wednesday night. A good first half was followed by a less good second one, with the game decided primarily because of Arsenal mistakes which were ruthlessly punished. We also chat about missed chances, and the importance of taking them in games like this, the fine margins, analyse the goals we conceded, and talk about the way the team played to its principles despite a lot of pressure from the opposition. Did we have the variety to play any differently? We assess our position and situation now, and answer listener questions about how the manager might be able to arrest the funk we find ourselves in, another injury at a bad time for Thomas Partey, possible changes for the Villa game, and lots more.</p><br /><p><strong>Get extra bonus content and help support Arseblog by becoming an Arseblog Member on Patreon: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/arseblog\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>https://www.patreon.com/arseblog</strong></a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

The Arsenal performance is one thing, but there's a lot of discussion of VAR, Lee Mason 'forgetting' to do his job, and how it feels like we've been robbed of two points. We acknowledge a good Brentford display, and ask whether there might be any kind of silver lining to the officials making such a bad decision. There's chat about the game itself, especially with Man City on the horizon, the atmosphere in the stadium as the title race reality really sinks in, and lots more – including questions about how we cope with the deep block, possible changes for Wednesday and squad rotation in general, Erling Haaland's reported injury, the standard of officiating, and the new stadium artwork.</p><br /><p>Help the Turkey/Syria earthquake appeal here: <a href=\"https://www.dec.org.uk/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.dec.org.uk/</a></p><br /><p><strong>Get extra bonus content and help support Arseblog by becoming an Arseblog Member on Patreon: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/arseblog\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>https://www.patreon.com/arseblog</strong></a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

We chat about Arsenal's control in the first half, the goals we scored, and the importance of Aaron Ramsdale's performance – not least the timing of some of his saves. There's spotlight on Martin Odegaard as his fine form continues, how different this was from the game last May and why, and the unseemly scenes at the end of the game and Spurs culpability in that regard. We also answer listener questions about transfers after Mykhaylo Mudryk signed for Chelsea, what now for Arsenal in the market?

Some slight rustiness in the first half was overcome in the second, as Bukayo Saka, Gabriel Martinelli and Eddie Nketiah grabbed the goals. We discuss the goalscorers, the wider significance of Nketiah's strike in the current context, getting back to winning ways quickly, the importance of competitive football for top players, and our lead at the top of the table. We then answer listener questions about the return of Arsene Wenger for the first time since his departure in 2018, the official bid for Mykhaylo Mudryk and where he might fit into the team, why there are still doubts over Eddie, agent roles in transfer rumours and lots more.</p><br /><p><strong>Get extra bonus content and help support Arseblog by becoming an Arseblog Member on Patreon: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/arseblog\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>https://www.patreon.com/arseblog</strong></a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

There's also discussion of the January transfer window, the impact of the upcoming World Cup, and some thoughts on the tournament in general as FIFA's stranglehold on the game continues.

Arsenal didn't make the most of their chances to win the game, but nor did we get the rub of the green when it came the officiating – with some glaring errors by the referee. We chat about that balance, but also about how heightened expectations this season make a draw away from home feel quite so bad. There's discussion of second half sloppiness and whether it was down to fatigue, as well as questions about Gabriel Jesus and his goalscoring so far this season, whether we need a 'Plan B', Fabio Vieira, more Ben White media fun, and lots more.</p><br /><p><strong>Get extra bonus content and help support Arseblog by becoming an Arseblog Member on Patreon: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/arseblog\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>https://www.patreon.com/arseblog</strong></a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

Starting with the referee/comms delay and the suspension of the game just 60 seconds in, then to an even first half, a sensational Bukayo Saka goal to put us in front, followed by a second half full of incident and which was a exercise in endurance for Arsenal fans. Patrick Bamford had a goal disallowed and then missed a penalty as Leeds dominated the half, we couldn't get a hold on the game at all, but dug deep to hang on and take all three points, plus there was more late drama as a red card and a penalty awarded to Leeds were both overturned. Then we answer listener questions about Gabriel, who was at the centre of that late incident, rotation for the Europa League, whether grinding out a win is good, Tomiyasu, and lots more.</p><br /><p><strong>Get extra bonus content and help support Arseblog by becoming an Arseblog Member on Patreon: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/arseblog\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>https://www.patreon.com/arseblog</strong></a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

Tim and Art also address the subject of squad rotation and why Spurs might be better preparation for Ajax than Brighton were.

We chat about the players missing through injury and the impact that had, Martin Odegaard's excellent performance, the goal we conceded and the way we responded to come back and overturn the deficit to take all three points. There's discussion of the atmosphere, Mikel Arteta and the bench, and Gabriel's redemption arc. Then we answer questions about the tedious celebration police and one pair in particular, transfer market expectations between now and the close of the window on Thursday, Kieran Tierney in the Zinchenko role, possible changes for Villa and lots more.</p><br /><p><strong>Get extra bonus content and help support Arseblog by becoming an Arseblog Member on Patreon: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/arseblog\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>https://www.patreon.com/arseblog</strong></a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

A game that started brilliantly with two early goals and in which we played 10 men for over an hour became quite nerve-wracking after their out of the blue goal in the second period. We chat about the fear, why it was so intense when in reality Arsenal were in control for the most part, losing composure and how it manifested itself, James' coping mechanism, as well as how important the three points were, and a bit focus on some excellent individual performances. There are inevitable questions about the derby on Thursday which feels very much like a cup final given everything that's at stake, including how we might set up and what tweaks we might make to our defensive line-up. Plus Mohamed Elneny's contract, some chat about Mikel Arteta's new deal and lots more before we have to give up after talking ourselves into a state of turmoil.</p><br /><p><strong>Get extra bonus content and help support Arseblog by becoming an Arseblog Member on Patreon: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/arseblog\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>https://www.patreon.com/arseblog</strong></a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

We start with Granit Xhaka's selection at left-back, how it impacted the team, and what it means for Nuno Tavares. We chat about the goals we conceded, the lacklustre performance when there was supposed to be a reaction, some poor decision making, and how a late flurry wasn't enough to prevent a truly disheartening result. There's also stuff on Alexandre Lacazette and the need for a change up front, as well as questions about a shift in formation, keeping fringe players more involved, VAR, our top four chances and Mikel Arteta, great rivalries and lots more.</p><br /><p><strong>Get extra bonus content and help support Arseblog by becoming an Arseblog Member on Patreon: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/arseblog\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>https://www.patreon.com/arseblog</strong></a><strong> – this month every penny we earn from Patreon will be donated to Unicef to help children affected by conflict around the world.</strong></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

We chat about the fallout from the Crystal Palace game, and injuries to two key players - Kieran Tierney and Thomas Partey, as well as the best way for Mikel Arteta to deal with their absences with Nuno Tavares and Albert Sambi Lokonga waiting in the wings. There's also a long discussion about what to do up front, with Alexandre Lacazette's lack of goalscoring contribution now becoming a significant issue for the team. Should being shorn of two experienced players have an impact on the Frenchman's place in the team?

We chat about the need for greater scrutiny on football club ownership, and the asterisk that has to be part of any discussion of Chelsea's success. We also talk about the Champions League, the excitement building around our potential return to it, upgrading the midfield in the summer, defensive lapses, coping with a hectic upcoming schedule and lots more.</p><br /><p>Follow Clive <a href=\"https://twitter.com/clivepafc\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">@clivepafc</a></p><br /><p>If you want to become an Arseblog Member on Patreon, you can sign up at <a href=\"https://patreon.com/arseblog\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">patreon.com/arseblog</a> for just €5 per month.</p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

We start by acknowledging some of the things that weren't great, as laid out by Mikel Arteta in his post-game press conference, but focus more on what was good about the game – not least the three brilliant goals scored by Martin Odegaard, Bukayo Saka, and Gabriel Martinelli which put us into the top four. We discuss our recent form and league position in a good weekend of results for us, before answering questions about Kieran Tierney, the left-hand side not being quite as effective as the right from an attacking perspective, finding that perfect centre-forward, the all red shorts, and lots more.</p><br /><p><em>Thanks to Mark Hallesy for the image.</em></p><br /><p>Get extra bonus content and help support Arseblog by becoming an Arseblog Member on Patreon: <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/arseblog\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.patreon.com/arseblog</a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

We chat about a poor start, resulting in exactly the kind of game scenario we didn't want, as well as some missed chances for the visitors. The conversation then turns to Arsenal overcoming the stats to produce late turnaround which feels really significant. Nicolas Pepe came on to equalise, Alexandre Lacazette's winner might officially be an own goal but he deserves credit for his impact on what was a difficult night for him otherwise. We also talk about what this victory means for a young team that's learning and growing together, the midfield options which are proving invaluable, a show of character and lots more.</p><br /><p>There's also a late, Lacazette-style cameo from James after the final music, so stay tuned.</p><br /><p>Follow Ryan <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ryanhunn\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">@ryanhunn</a></p><br /><p>If you want to become an Arseblog Member on Patreon, you can sign up at <a href=\"https://patreon.com/arseblog\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">patreon.com/arseblog</a> for just €5 per month.</p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

We chat about Arsenal's control and dominance, some contentious decisions from the officials, but ultimately the winning contributions from Emile Smith Rowe and Bukayo Saka. We also examine our top four chances, before answering listener questions about Lacazette's role as centre-forward, whether we can get all the 'Fab Four' in the team at the same time and how, Martin Odegaard, Champions League coming too soon, and much more – including James' singing songs to his dog and a lot of journalists.</p><br /><p>And if you haven't seen it, here's the amazing work from @SebbyV21 - <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SebbyV21/status/1494465787733716993\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://twitter.com/SebbyV21/status/1494465787733716993</a></p><br /><p>Get extra bonus content and help support Arseblog by becoming an Arseblog Member on Patreon: <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/arseblog\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.patreon.com/arseblog</a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

We also talk about the exciting potential of the young players in this team, and answer questions about how we fit them all in, whether the Aubameyang situation might change the thinking over Alexandre Lacazette, home form v away form, worries over disruption to football because of the rise in Covid cases, and lots more.</p><br /><p>Get extra bonus content and help support Arseblog by becoming an Arseblog Member on Patreon: <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/arseblog\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.patreon.com/arseblog</a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

After a shaky start we scored a breathtaking goal to spark us into life, and set us on the way to three points. We chat about that kind of goal and the way you have to play to score it, Martin Odegaard grabbing his third in three games, a hugely impressive second half, and ponder the stark difference between our home and away form this season. In the second half there's a big discussion about the Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang situation, what happened and why, how it became public, and what happens next. There are also questions about strikers, the pecking order, potential January business, the captaincy, Takehiro Tomiyasu, Santi Cazorla and loads more.</p><br /><p>Get extra bonus content and help support Arseblog by becoming an Arseblog Member on Patreon: <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/arseblog\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.patreon.com/arseblog</a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

There's a flavour of the atmosphere inside the Emirates, the energy that transmitted around the ground, a brilliant first half performance with some outstanding individual contributions, a huge win for Mikel Arteta, a goal and an assist each for Smith Rowe and Saka, and pretty much everyone gets a mention for the way we put the old enemy to the sword. We then answer listener questions about Aaron Ramsdale, Tomiyasu, a revitalised Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, the potential for a winning run, the summer recruitment paying dividends, and lots more, including a brand new jingle to celebrate the derby win.</p><br /><p>Get extra bonus content and help support Arseblog by becoming an Arseblog Member on Patreon: <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/arseblog\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>https://www.patreon.com/arseblog</strong></a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

We talk about the underlying culture of physicality in English football, how this is not a new thing – something Arsenal fans know only too well – and the way that refereeing and officiating appears to have a make it up as you go along element to it.

Even with players missing, should we have seen better from Mikel Arteta and his team? We analyse the goals, the defensive lapses, chat about not going with a back three, why we didn't react quickly enough to Chelsea's threat, Lukaku v Mari and there's an existential Granit Xhaka question from the stands of the stadium itself. Then we answer listener questions about a potential trolley dash v2 if we lose badly to Man City, Arteta's future, why we appear to have moved away from playing out from the back, the impact of Covid-19 on us and how it might affect the Premier League as a whole, Willian's social media likes and lots more.Get extra bonus content and help support Arseblog by becoming an Arseblog Member on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/arseblog<hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

Thomas Partey looked good but then got injured, potentially bad news for fans and for Mikel Arteta. His replacement, Granit Xhaka, looked like a dead cert departure this summer but now he's going to stay – we discuss the implications of that as we still look to improve our midfield. There's a lot of transfer chat, with focus on the difficulties we're having moving players on, as well as listener questions about who might leave, the possible arrival of another striker as we target Lautaro Martinez, injury speculation, refereeing in friendlies, Eddie Nketiah and lots more.</p><br /><p><a href=\"https://arsebiz.arseblog.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Visit Arsebiz</a> to support fellow Gooners.</p><br /><p>Get extra bonus content and help support Arseblog by becoming an Arseblog Member on Patreon: <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/arseblog\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>https://www.patreon.com/arseblog</strong></a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

With no Europe next season, how far do we need to trim the numbers – at times last year Arsenal had a 33+ man panel. Who might be able to provide versatility to cover in various positions? Just how much midfield recruitment do we need, taking into account some of the names we've been linked with? We also chat potential comings and goings in every area of the team, from front to back, including the need for at least one goalkeeper before the season starts, and maybe two.

In the book, Chris and Patricia have uncovered a string of hitherto unknown facts and stats about the competition, which has suffered from a lack of documentation.</p><br /><p>Chris discusses some of the difficulties and barriers of compiling accurate information about some of those early finals and the importance of accurately depicting the history of the women's game and understanding the barriers faced by players. Rachel Yankey did not know that she held the record for appearances in the final until Chris and Patricia's research uncovered the fact. Chris also discusses his relatively recent discovery of women's football and his passion for helping others to discover it too.</p><br /><p>You can buy 'A history of the Women's FA Cup Final' at all of the usual retailers and we're sure your local book shop would be happy to order it in for you too.

We also talk about Mikel Arteta's interview on Sky and examine why he took such umbrage over certain reports in the media, what lies ahead in terms of a summer rebuild and reset, the reported desire of five senior players to leave, what the transfer market might be like, and lots more.</p><br /><p>Follow James <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jamesbenge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">@jamesbenge</a></p><br /><p>If you want to become an Arseblog Member on Patreon, you can sign up at <a href=\"https://patreon.com/arseblog\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">patreon.com/arseblog</a> for just €5 per month.</p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

After falling behind to a sheer fluke of a goal, Martin Odegaard equalised and Alexandre Lacazette's second half penalty secured the points. We chat about the collective performance, some very good individual ones, the absence of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, the terrifying final 10 minutes, the red card , Harry Kane's nasty challenge, but most of all enjoy an important win over the old rivals and beating their manager too. Then we have questions about Kieran Tierney, players shouting at each, Emile Smith Rowe, trying to make Odegaard's signing permanent, Gabriel Martinelli and loads more.</p><br /><p><a href=\"https://arsebiz.arseblog.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Visit Arsebiz</a> to support fellow Gooners.</p><br /><p>Get extra bonus content and help support Arseblog by becoming an Arseblog Member on Patreon: <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/arseblog\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>https://www.patreon.com/arseblog</strong></a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

We also answer listener questions about Hector Bellerin and the right back situation, the perception of referee bias against Arsenal, whether we should employ the 'dark arts' more, Gabriel Martinelli as a striker, and lots more.</p><br /><p>For extra content, ad-free podcasts, Discord chat, live streams and more - <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/arseblog\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>support Arseblog on Patreon</strong></a>.</p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

There's focus on young players Joe Willock and Reiss Nelson who didn't quite take the opportunity, as well as the impact of another youngster, Emile Smith Rowe, who really did. We talk about the game, Bernd Leno's significant contribution, the positive VAR decision, Aubameyang getting on the scoresheet, Nicolas Pepe, and the positive aspects of a game which wasn't especially memorable. We then have listener question as we explore the Willian situation and where it might end, a new deal for Rob Holding in the context of our current collection of centre-halves, who else we should be looking to tie down, the search for a goalkeeper in the January transfer window, who covers for Kieran Tierney and loads more.</p><br /><p><a href=\"https://arsebiz.arseblog.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Visit Arsebiz</a> to support fellow Gooners.</p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

We chat about the substitutions, the fact we were in injury time before we got a shot on target in the second half, and how the manager is looking at stats for some positive reinforcement.

Despite knowing how they wanted to sucker punch us, we left our jaw hanging out there for a good punching. We chat about the team selection, Thomas Partey's involvement and the bizarre way it ended, conceding two in the first half and then being allowed to dominate the second, and, of course, all the crosses we made. So. Many. Crosses. Then there are listener questions about Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Willian, the pressure on Mikel Arteta, a sad glimpse at the Premier League table, and lots more, including the exasperated horse (we hate the horse).</p><br /><p>Buy the <a href=\"https://www.redbubble.com/i/greeting-card/Goodly-Christmas-by-arseblog/62566466.5MT14?asc=u\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Goodly Christmas card here</a> – all proceeds go to the Arsenal Foundation.</p><br /><p><a href=\"https://arsebiz.arseblog.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Visit Arsebiz</a> to support fellow Gooners.</p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

James was there, so we talk about his experience as one of the 2,000 lucky supporters, the impact it might have had on the players, and the very obvious difference it makes to the experience, whether you're there or watching from afar. We then chat about the match, goals for Alex Lacazette, Pablo Mari, Eddie Nketiah and Emile Smith Rowe, and an excellent performance from Ainsley Maitland-Niles, but does it put him in contention to start the derby on Sunday? There also questions about Arteta's desire to play a 4-3-3, the visit to White Hart Lane and the importance of not losing, blue kits at home, the use of young players, a possible January clearout and loads more.</p><br /><p>Buy the <a href=\"https://www.redbubble.com/i/greeting-card/Goodly-Christmas-by-arseblog/62566466.5MT14?asc=u\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Goodly Christmas card here</a> – all proceeds go to the Arsenal Foundation.</p><br /><p><a href=\"https://arsebiz.arseblog.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Visit Arsebiz</a> to support fellow Gooners.</p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

We start by talking about the collision between David Luiz and Raul Jimenez which left the Wolves man with a fractured skull. Should the Brazilian have continued, and when is football going to start taking head injuries more seriously? Then it's the football, and although we intended to analyse the game in some detail, it quickly became a very broad discussion about what's going at the club right now. The short-term issues versus the long-term needs, the poor decision making from top to bottom, the pressure on Mikel Arteta, whether our footballing identity needs to come from on high or via the manager, personnel and recruitment, Edu's role, the need for more top-level scrutiny, and how bad it would need to get for things to change in football's most obvious way.

The second was complicated by the dismissal of Nicolas Pepe, and in the end a point in the context of the game was reasonable. We discuss the sending off, how the record signing blew a big chance, and Mikel Arteta's reaction to it. There's also chat about the importance of Bukayo Saka, as well as the club's dismal use of resources, before questions about the manager and his non-negotiables, the need for some stability, set-pieces, and lots more.<hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

There's a lot to unpack as we discuss a very poor collective performance along with some very poor individual ones. How much is Mikel Arteta's system at fault, when it comes to analysing players who are under-performing? Our creative problems come into sharp focus again as missed chances prove costly, and we talk about how this game needs to spark some kind of rethink from the manager. We make suggestions about how we could attempt to fix it, wonder if the absence of fans has played a part in sticking with this approach for so long, and lots more besides.&nbsp;<hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

We chat about the team selection and the way the starting XI executed the game-plan so well. Within the impressive collective performance, there were some eye-catching individuals too, and we shine the light on some of those, including Gabriel, Rob Holding, Hector Bellerin, Thomas Partey, and Mohamed Elneny – a player who probably wouldn't have been first choice for many but who made such a big contribution on the day. We answer listener questions about fine margins, foul throws, what Willian brings to the team (or doesn't), why we need to think about zones more than formations, the influence of Tim Lewis and LOADS more.<hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

Arsenal can rue missed chances and an abysmal decision to chalk off an early goal, but the second half performance in particular left much to be desired. We chat about some individual performances, like Alex Lacazette, David Luiz, Dani Ceballos and Thomas Partey, as well as our lack of chance creation, and wonder is it down the rigid system in which Mikel Arteta expects his players to operate. It leads to a in-depth discussion about the manager, his preferences, what kind of football he wants to play and how it impacts performances. There's also questions about young players looking a bit out in the cold at the moment, whether the honeymoon period is over for Arteta and loads more.<hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

We chat about the scoreline in the context of other defeats there in recent years, and the selection decision Mikel Arteta made in using Willian in that particular role. How much was this game Arteta v Guardiola? Could we have been more adventurous in general or later in the match as we looked for an equaliser? There's a lot on how to best make the team more attacking, there's Aubameyang in the middle stuff, and praise for the impressive Bukayo Saka whose form might have an impact on the way we use the captain. We also answer questions about the job Arteta is doing, whether we still need to buy a centre-half despite having so many, Willian, Wenger's Cesc revelation, and loads more.<hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

      "description": "On this episode of the Arsecast Extra we discuss the 2-1 win over Sheffield United on Sunday, in which two excellent second half goals helped us to three points against a difficult side. We touch on the introduction of Nicolas Pepe and the change in shape as a key factor in the win, a first Emirates goal for Bukayo Saka, the positives we should take from this game despite clear room for improvement, and where it leaves us in the table after the first four games. Then, as it's transfer deadline day, we deal with a lot of listener questions about our business during this window. Has Mikel Arteta been backed properly? Should the owners do more to invest in the team? Has Edu convinced in his new role? How much has past spending hindered us this summer? And if there are no arrivals, could Saka be the addition to midfield that we need? All that, and lots more.<hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

We discuss the man of the match performance of Bernd Leno and ask if it's time now to stop the constant comparisons with Emi Martinez. We also chat about the positives of three wins out of four against Liverpool in recent months, Nicolas Pepe on the left, the penalty shoot-out itself and the wonderful, ice-cold way in which Ainsley Maitland-Niles takes his. We then answer listener questions about William Saliba and a potential loan departure, whether we have other midfield targets beyond Houssem Aouar and Thomas Partey, our transfer business in general, the prospect of lots of loan moves both in and out, and more.&nbsp;&nbsp;<hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

All concerned are trying to play it as amicable, mutual decision, but does that really make any sense given the timing of it, and how closely it's come to an internal investigation by owners KSE. We chat about the former Head of Football and the work he did at the club, how the spotlight now falls on Technical Director Edu, and we explore his closeness to Sanllehi, the agent led approach and what he needs to deliver. There are also questions about new signing Willian, whether Vinai Venkatesham is the right man to lead the club at executive level, how our recruitment might work now and the big gap that exists within the structure, Willian's signing and lots more.<hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

We then chat in some depth about the changes made to the club's scouting network, letting Francis Cagigao and many of his team go, and the way we recruit players. Is our approach sufficient in the modern game, particularly when both your scouting and analysis departments feel somewhat marginalised in the process? We also touch on the redundancies and how the players might feel, before answering questions about Wilfried Zaha, Ainsley Maitland-Niles, and the Alexandre Lacazette situation.

      "description": "The Premier League season is over and we look back on the final day victory over Watford, in what was a fairly meaningless game for us. There's discussion of Kieran Tierney's first Arsenal goal, David Luiz conceding another penalty and setting a record in the process, and we reflect on an 8th placed finish overall. We're glad to see the back of the season, and lessons have to be learned, but we try to end part 1 with some positives to take from this campaign. In part 2 we answer listener questions about our central defensive options and what on earth we can do about them. We pick our FA Cup final team, do some Aubameyang/Arsenal role play over his future, Ozil and his likely absence from Wembley, how to stop Olivier Giroud and loads more.<hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

It was a game in which we were dominated and which sparked multiple incidents of amusement, not least the defensive errors which led to our goals. However, we had to be alert to make the most of them, and in the second period a committed defensive rearguard put everything on the line to keep the Mugsmashers at bay, so the team deserve credit for that. We chat about Alexandre Lacazette's excellent contribution, our strange set-up, Emi Martinez's brilliant late save, and Reiss Nelson's first Premier League goal, before we answer questions about Mikel Arteta's very pointed post-game comments about the need to improve the squad, the Martinez v Leno situation, what we might bring in if we sold Ainsley Maitland-Niles, the formation for Man City on Saturday and LOADS more.<hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

Arsenal should have taken more of their chances in the first half of the 1-1 draw against Leicester, but in the end had to hang on with 10 men after a late equaliser. There were plenty of positives in that first period though, including another impressive Dani Ceballos performance and Bukayo Saka's contribution from the right. We discuss the missed chances, the red card for Eddie Nketiah and whether Jamie Vardy should have had one too, and Mikel Arteta's post game comments about the officiating and if that's a good thing or not. We also have questions about the front three for the North London derby, if it's time to play Aubameyang up front, Xhaka as a central defender, the prolonging of the 5 subs rule and lots more.<hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

      "description": "On this show we look back on the very encouraging 2-0 win over Wolves on Saturday, and a performance full of effort from the Arsenal players. It looks like they're buying into the manager's methods, and we discuss the decisions Mikel Arteta made with his team, another set of very effective substitutions, containing a very strong Wolves side, and keeping a clean sheet in the process. There's also some chat about Matteo Guendouzi who is seeing the Good Ship Arteta sail off into the distance without him, before we answer questions about the back three and if it's here to stay, whether Shkodran Mustafi should get a new deal, similarly if new terms should be offered to Alex Lacazette, Sead Kolasinac in the back three, Santi Cazorla and lots more.<hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

Midfield issues were obvious, we go over all three goals, Mikel Arteta's in-game management and the changes he made (and didn't make), and discuss just how disappointing a result it was. After the break we take questions about why the players didn't react properly to seeing a teammate get injured, the lack of leadership among senior players, what's happening with Gabriel Martinelli, some realistic positives we'd like to see between now and the end of the season, and lots more.<hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

David Luiz was culpable, with a mistake, conceding a penalty and a red card, and we discuss his role on the night and what his role should be going forward. There's the omission of Mesut Ozil from the squad entirely, defensive problems due to injuries and suspensions, and we talk at length about the need to resolve some big, long-standing issues before we can start to move on as a football club.<hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

We chat about how we're feeling about that, about facing Man City, and try and guess what his starting XI is going to be for that game. We're still waiting for the rest of the fixtures to be announced, and we wonder what the impact of games being played behind closed doors will have on fans and their relationship to the game. Then we answer listener questions about the reports on the David Luiz deal, what it might mean for our defence when there are other players we might want to let go first but the transfer market might prevent that, Raul Sanllehi, a recap of life under Arteta ahead of football getting going again, and lots more.<hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

On this month's episode, Tim is joined by Rich Laverty to discuss Arsenal's domestic dominance under Vic Akers and some of the players that underpinned it. Rich recently wrote an article on Arsenal Ladies' success in the Arsenal special edition of <a href=\"https://thesefootballtimes.shop/products/arsenal\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">These Football Times magazine</a>.</p><br /><p>Tim is then joined by women's football journalist Catherine Etoe, who covered Arsenal extensively in the early 2000s. Tim and Catherine discuss the great Gunners sides of the early 21st century. Catherine covered both legs of the 2007 European Cup Final against Umea and she reminisces about Arsenal's achievement in that final. Also this month, we hear from Gunners left-back Katie McCabe on this month's edition of 'Teammates.' Who from the current squad would make the best Prime Minister? Who would be the best in a fight?

However, it was an absolute pleasure to have a Skype conversation with former Arsenal captain Cesc Fabregas on Friday night.</p><br /><p>We talk about how his move to Arsenal came about. What was it like as a teenager leaving home to come live in London, and join a club at the height of its power and success under Arsene Wenger? That was a dressing room with some big names and even bigger personalities – how did a 16 year old deal with that? We chat about his time at the club, his development as a player and a person, Arsene Wenger as a coach and how he helped him, plus his departure in the summer of 2011, playing for Barcelona, the return to England, whether or not he could have come back to us and lots more.</p><br /><p>Cesc is very open and honest throughout, and I'm hugely appreciative of the time he gave me for this podcast. I hope you enjoy it.</p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

Many players see this as a privilege and an important responsibility- but to what extent is it fair? Is this just invisible labour we blithely place on female athletes?</p><br /><p>Then Tim talks to Gunners defender Louise Quinn, who is a patron for lots of initiatives geared towards increasing participation in sport for young girls. Louise talks about why she believes in the power of role modelling and about her female role models when she was growing up. Tim also talks to Louise about how her and her teammates are handling training in times of quarantine and social distancing in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

On a football level we talk about the games, transfer windows, what happens when the Premier League is suspended, transfer windows, Euro 2020 which might become Euro 2021, magpies and magpie facts, deciding the league via FIFA on the Playstation, and LOADS more besides.</p><p>Still watch this video if you haven't already: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcJDpV-igjs&amp;feature=youtu.be\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcJDpV-igjs&amp;feature=youtu.be</a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

After that, ahead of this weekend's North London derby, Tim Stillman chats with Arsenal midfielder Jordan Nobbs about the game, her recovery from an ACL injury, the increased spotlight on the women's game and lots more.</p><br /><p><strong>Follow Philippe</strong> - <a href=\"https://twitter.com/philippeauclair\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">@philippeauclair</a></p><p><strong>Follow Tim</strong> - <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stillberto\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">@stillberto</a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

We examine the red card, the roles of Mustafi and Luiz, but focus on the Arsenal response including Gabriel Martinelli's brilliant goal, Hector Bellerin's late equaliser, Granit Xhaka playing superbly at centre-half, the hugely positive Bukayo Saka and what this result and performance might mean for the team, the manager and the fans.<hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

There were positives though, in particular another goal for Gabriel Martinelli and a very good display from Bukayo Saka which should give Arsenal pause for thought when it comes to transfer rumours involving a left-back. We chat about our inability to close out a game, the penalty that wasn't given and the late goal we conceded.

We chat about turnaround, Mikel Arteta's half-time teamtalk, the response from the players, Sokratis rampaging down the wing, Reiss Nelson's goal, and the win itself. Then we have listener questions about Granit Xhaka's fouling and how it went down on TV, Nicolas Pepe and Matteo Guendouzi as players who need some rough edges polished off them, whether this is a false dawn under Mikel Arteta, protecting the 49 game unbeaten run and lots more.<hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

The hectic schedule is another big talking point, as well as injuries and fatigue to take into account for Wednesday's game against Man Utd.

It's a decision they were left with little choice over, form and performances have been poor, and we reflect on the Spaniard's Arsenal reign. What were the warning signs and the breaking points? Freddie Ljungberg has been named interim coach, what can we expect from him? Then we answer questions about potential long-term replacements, like Mikel Arteta, Patrick Vieira, Max Allegri, Brendan Rodgers and others, before talking about the people who have to make that decision. Is there faith in Raul Sanllehi and co, and what about the role of the owners KSE? All this and lots more.<hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

Emery's future is an ongoing issue, but we turn some focus on the decision makers at the club and ask why are they allowing this to continue?

      "description": "Given that Granit Xhaka's statement came out last night, it wasn't covered in Episode 550 of the Arsecast. So here's a bonus Arsecast Extra episode in which James and I unpick what the Arsenal captain said. Why was it released through his own social media channel and not an official club one? Should we read anything into the lack of mention of the manager, or the captaincy? Was it really an apology? Can Xhaka stay on as captain? And what has the response of the club been like? That and more in this extra Arsecast Extra.<hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

      "description": "Arsenal's 2-2 draw with Crystal Palace was disappointing, but the big story is the substitution of Granit Xhaka, the fan reaction to him and his reaction to the fans. Can we separate the footballer from the human being? What do we make of him having a pop back, even if his behaviour was wrong was it understandable that his emotion got the better of him? What next for him, in relation to playing and the captaincy, and is this just a symptom of a wider malaise? That, plus underwhelming football, more dropped points, increased pressure on Unai Emery, VAR costing Arsenal three points, as well as questions about social media likes, managerial candidates, unity and togetherness, season expectations and lots more.&nbsp;<hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

We chat about how this might impact him and boost his confidence, especially ahead of the weekend game against Crystal Palace. Other positives include Gabriel Martinelli, fitness boosts for some of our important players, and more, before a long discussion about Mesut Ozil, Unai Emery and what now appears to be a personal PR war between the two. What can the club do about this situation which has been festering for over a year? Then we have questions about the young players, Lucas Torreira's role, Bellerin and Tierney, how fans are feeling about our football and the manager, and one horrendous potential candidate to take over from Emery.

We chat about the game, the indifferent Arsenal performance, an inability to create chances despite having lots of possession, and how this is just the continuation of a run of form that goes back to last season too. Then the second half of the show is basically questions about Unai Emery and the work he's doing: boiling down to the big one, is he the right man for the club, and is it time to make a change? It's long, not particularly cheery, but I think we've covered all the angles.&nbsp;<hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

As you'll be well aware, it's about that famous night at Anfield, an oral history in which the players, the manager, staff and fans talk about what happened and what it all meant. We discuss the book itself, the achievement of winning the title against a team as good as Liverpool, how winning the title meant something of a new start for Arsenal but almost the end of a footballing era in the wake of Hillsborough and the state of the game in the 80s, and lots more. Enjoy.</p><p>Follow Amy on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/amylawrence71\" target=\"_blank\">@amylawrence71</a> – and you can pick the book up from your local bookshop from tomorrow (October 3rd), on audio-book via Audible, or online via the usual outlets including <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/89-Inside-Arsenals-1988-Season/dp/1780898274/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3LB4ENN1JIKU5&amp;keywords=amy+lawrence+89&amp;qid=1570014271&amp;sprefix=amy+la%2Caps%2C129&amp;sr=8-1\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>.</p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's goal again highlighted his importance to the team, and in Guendouzi, Saka, Leno and Chambers, there were positives. But Unai Emery's approach remains under the spotlight, the performance was insipid, and his brand of football is hard to connect with.

Having been 2-0 up at the break, we were lucky not to lose, and the second half performance in particular raises serious questions about the manager and his team. Why do we allow so many shots? Why do we concede so many penalties? Is there enough accountability? Is there something in the culture at the club that accepts too many individual mistakes? We go into it in detail, from the goals we scored to the ones we conceded, what the result says about this team and its character, and what it means for Emery who is finding the tide of public opinion turning against him. All that, plus listener questions about the Europa League, Aubameyang's contract, Calum Chambers, Pepe's impact so far and lots more.&nbsp;<hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

On the one hand, Jordan Nobbs made her long awaited return from an ACL injury during August, coming on as a second half substitute before scoring in a 6-0 victory over Spurs. Tim and Pippa caught up with Jordan exclusively for the podcast just after that game.</p><br /><p>On the flipside, Danielle Carter ruptured her anterior cruciate ligament for the second time in 14 months during the Emirates Cup game against Bayern Munich. The game was her first start since her last ACL injury and it's a difficult one to take for her, mentally as well as physically.</p><br /><p>Female footballers are somewhere between 4-6 times more likely to rupture their ACL than their male counterparts. Tim and Pippa spoke to knee surgeon Pete Gallacher, who has performed plenty of ACL reconstructions, about what the injury is, what the surgery and recovery entails and why women are so much more susceptible to it.</p><br /><p>We also have reaction to the Champions League draw with Fiorentina and Tim and Pippa pick out their players to watch for the season ahead and we have a cameo appearance from Danielle van de Donk.

There's some discussion about him, his role in the team and the frequency of those errors which raise questions about the coach's decisions too, as well a lot on our comeback, the goals of Lacazette and Aubameyang, how Ceballos helped change the dynamic, and a fantastic performance from Matteo Guendouzi. Then we answer listener questions about Henrikh Mkhitaryan's departure, young players like Nelson and Willock, what the future holds for Mesut Ozil and Ainsley Maitland-Niles, Sokratis and the centre of our defence, and loads more.&nbsp;<hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

Although Arsenal still have something to play for in the Europa League final, we chat about the Premier League campaign, Man City's title winner, Liverpool's challenge, how the league can be competitive again with City's financial domination, as well as some Arsenal and the rest of the top four. There's also some stuff on the Europa League final situation with Baku, Henrikh Mkhitaryan and more.<hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

Joe talks about his managerial philosophy, how he secured tactical buy-in from his players after taking over in 2017 and how the squad has created such a tight bond. After that, we speak with German international Tabea Kemme about an injury ravaged debut season, her other career as a policewoman and how growing up on a farm in Germany influenced her outlook on life. Both of these interviews are exclusive to Arseblog News.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>Pod archives: <a href=\"https://arseblog.news/category/arsenal-women/arsenal-women-podcast/\" target=\"_blank\">https://arseblog.news/category/arsenal-women/arsenal-women-podcast/</a></p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

Including: The FA Cup final and Man City's soulless treble, Pep Guardiola taking exception to being questioned, and how many fans need a measure of cognitive dissonance when it comes to their football clubs these days. Has City's financial domination seen us reach some kind of tipping point? We also discuss the Henrikh Mkhitaryan situation with regards the Europa League final in Baku, Reiss Nelson's Arsenal future, how do we fit wingers into a team with two strikers, Steve Bould, Mustafi to Milan, Santi Cazorla and lots more.<hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

We then chat about the big job coming up this summer, whichever flavour of European football we have, and that's the squad rebuild. Will Emery and the club be ruthless to deal with the many issues at hand? Can we do what we need to do with the budget we have? And do the circumstances suggest that doors may be opened for young players to take their chance in a squad that requires a lot of work? All that and lots more.</p><br /><p>Follow Jim @eastlower and Clive @clivepafc</p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

James and I discuss the Leicester game, Unai Emery's approach, and the result in the context of our recent form which has seen us lose four of our last five league games. We chat about the squad, what needs to be done, the manager and his work, the ownership, the structures we're supposed to have in place but don't, our recruitment needs this summer, and loads more besides. There's a lot of introspection, plenty of confusion, a smidgen of bewilderment and probably no satisfactory answers but Arsenal's situation right now is a long way from black and white.

We also chat about the Wolves game, away form, Leicester and more.<hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

      "description": "In 2006-07, Arsenal Ladies achieved a unique quadruple- winning the Premier League, FA Cup, Premier League Cup and the European Cup. They remain the only British side in the women’s game to have won Europe’s top prize. In this episode we speak with then Gunners captain Faye White, who missed most of the season with a cruciate ligament injury. We talk to Faye about her mixed emotions watching an incredible season unfold from the treatment table. We also speak to Gunners legend and striker Kelly Smith, who returned to the club from the US after battling depression and alcoholism. Kelly enjoyed an excellent, injury free season- but missed both legs of the European Cup Final in controversial circumstances. Kelly talks candidly about her frustration with rough treatment from opponents and how that frustration built to cost her participation in the game of her life. Relive this historic season through the eyes of Arsenal Ladies’ most successful ever captain and all-time greatest player.<hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

From Unai Emery's team selection and formation, to the nightmare performance of Shkodran Mustafi, there's plenty to discuss. The German's role is front and centre, but did the manager take the visitors for granted, and leave himself short of options because he had to change so much at half-time. What now for our top four chances, we can qualify for the Champions League via our Premier League finish. How to approach Wednesday's game against Wolves, can we rest Laurent Koscielny, the probable end of Carl Jenkinson's Arsenal career and lots more.<hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

We touch on the performance, the goals we scored, the one we inevitably conceded, the team selection based on who Unai Emery had available to him, and we have to mention the Chelsea defeat which moved us up into 5th. There's some fun with the #sarriout hashtag, then serious questions about the abuse leveled at Alex Iwobi and Ainsley Maitland-Niles, Mavropanos being left out of the Europa League squad, how to approach the BATE Borisov game on Thursday, an either/or about our strikers, and more.<hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

She explains why the ground will be relatively empty despite a glamorous third round tie, the problems the fans have with the owner, why they've been boycotting games since 2015 and how teh visiting fans can help this weekend. There's also Arsenal chat with inspirational video maker Frimpon (@Frimponline), on the agenda the festive period, how things are going for Unai Emery, Aaron Ramsey's departure, the Mesut Ozil situation and lots more.&nbsp;<hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

We discuss the goals we conceded, the hapless nature of our defending, how badly we defending, what a load of rubbish we were at the back, and how we can't defend to save our lives. How much is on personnel and how much is on Unai Emery? Then there's the Mesut Ozil situation AGAIN, and why moving him on in January might well be the best thing for the club if we can make it happen, and we have listener questions about what we might do when transfer window opens, where the money might come from, we talk about how bad transfer business has been over the last few seasons, and lots more.

We then answer listener questions about Alexandre Lacazette's reaction to being subbed, how well our summer signings have done, the streak of bastardry that's in the team now, whether to rest Lucas Torriera for Brighton to ensure he'll be available for Liverpool, plus some festive fun at the end.<hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

We also discuss two players who are very much in the spotlight now – Petr Cech and Granit Xhaka. How many more games can the keeper be allowed make fundamental mistakes in, and do the positive aspects of Xhaka's game outweigh his lapses which often prove costly? Plus listener questions about playing out from the back, substitutions, the relationship between Aubameyang and Lacazette, and there's also an amazing scientific discovery at the end.<hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

We analyse the goals conceded, the manager's changes, our indifferent second half, and everything else that went down at Stamford Bridge.

It tells the remarkable story of 'Kaiser', a Brazilian who had a 26 year career in football despite being absolutely unable to play the game at this level. How on earth did he do it?

His Arsenal career didn't work out as well as he would have liked, but he retains a huge affection for the club, as he outlines in the chat we had last month. We discuss his early years, arriving to Arsenal as an 18 year old, settling in, dealing with injuries, the bright start to his time with the Gunners, winning the FA Cup against Man Utd, the times when things went wrong, his loan to AC Milan that was brought about by Mathieu Flamini, where football has taken him since, and where it might take him in the future. He speaks very candidly about his career, and he's a smart, intelligent guy, so I'm sure you'll enjoy this episode. Philippe is currently playing for Houston Dynamo in MLS.<hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

We discuss the use of VAR, and the new deal signed by Granit Xhaka which shows he's likely to be a key part of Unai Emery's midfield next season. Then we answer questions about Mesut Ozil and why there seems to be such debate and discussion about him as a player and his performances, the participation of the U21s in the Checkatrade Trophy next season, and lots more besides including a smattering of Jeff Goldblum.<hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

We look at his career progression, what kind of a player he is, how he might fit into the Arsenal set up, his strengths and weaknesses and more, before we chat for a bit about the World Cup which kicked off in Russia last night. Then it's Arsenal history with Andy Kelly, Mark Andrews and Tim Stillman. Their new book 'Royal Arsenal: Champions of the South' uncovers some fascinating new stuff about the formation of the club, dispels some myths and misinformation, going as far as discovering the exact plot of land on which our first game was played on. There's also a chance to win a signed copy.<hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

What kind of an impact will he have on the squad on and off the pitch? Is his age a worry in the fast-paced Premier League?

Over pastries and prosecco, we discuss the emotional day yesterday which saw Arsene Wenger take charge of the team for the final time at home. We chat about the day itself, the manager's legacy, what a beautiful occasion it was marked with a 5-0 win and an outpouring of goodwill and sentiment towards the boss. We then answer some listener questions about Wenger, possible replacements, the board and lots more (and there's some laughing at Stoke too!).<hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

Then we answer questions from listeners about the Carabao Cup final on Sunday, which formation we might use, a choice between trophies and a new manager, the low attendance and lack of interest in the Europa League game, some awesome names, and we also touch on the alleged Hector Bellerin audio clip that's been doing the rounds this week.<hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

Lack of firepower and defensive frailties were exposed, but how much of what's wrong stems from our midfield. We discuss the absence of Alexis Sanchez, the possibility of selling him to Man Utd and what that means for us as a club. We then answer questions about Arsene Wenger, whether signings like Aubameyang and Malcom can make any difference, our predictions for the rest of the season and much more.<hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

We chat about the manager, why something has to change at the club but why nothing probably will, the part Kroenke and Gazidis play in this current Arsenal – before we answer questions about Granit Xhaka, the lack of goals from midfield, what are the values of Arsenal and lots more.<hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

Needing to go to Anfield and win by two clear goals, Michael Thomas's last gasp winner has become an unforgettable piece of Arsenal history. Amy and I chat about the season itself, the making of the film, and more, before chatting more generally about the pressures football puts on players and fans these days – in particular the prospect of Christmas Eve football. There's also Steve McMahon's 1-minute finger.<hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

      "description": "The transfer window is now closed, what we have we hold, and what we did on deadline day wasn't that inspiring. In fact, it's a summer in which it feels we've failed to really invest properly in the squad. As a club we've ended up £30m in profit during the window, and as they say £30m in the bank is not going to score you many goals during the season. With me to discuss the transfer deadline day action, the summer in general, our state of affairs, and where we go from here are Andrew Allen, The Man from East Lower, Tayo Popoola, and Elliot Smith. This was recorded immediately after the window closing last night, so we look at the squad, Oxlade-Chamberlain leaving, Alexis staying, investment or lack of, issues of balance, the manager, the board, and and lots more.<hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

James writes about the increasing influence of extremely wealthy owners of football clubs, primarily in the Premier League, but across football in general too. What effect is it having on the game? What might it mean for football in the future?

The actual Mugsmasher is on holiday.Then I chat with Tim Stillman about goings-on at Arsenal, touching on team balance, the Oxlade-Chamberlain situation, Arsene Wenger's strange Shkodran Mustafi comments, why it feels like things are not right behind the scenes, transfer plans and expectations, and the Liverpool game of course.

We ask if the back three is actually making us defensively more secure, before moving onto the situations of Alexis, Ozil and Oxlade-Chamberlain, before discussing the transfer market, our need for a certain player and to move some others on.<hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

We chat about some of the changes and influences that have occurred over the years, how Arsenal and Arsene Wenger have had to pay more attention to that side of the game, the increased use of stats and data, and lots more.<hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

We answer questions about moments of the season, dropped points, what kind of defence we might see for the FA Cup final, potential signings, Danny Welbeck's CHAOS MODE and lots more.<hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

We ask whether the back three is going to be a long-term thing, especially with an FA Cup semi-final on Sunday, before answering listener's questions about Sead Kolasinac, the players post-game reaction and messages to the fans, who might benefit most from the new system, and why we need to get James to see the Supervet for the sake of all that's good about the human race.

We try and make sense of as much of it as possible before we answer some listener questions about Mesut Ozil, the so-called 'British core', Alexis being shifted to the left, what is the club these days, power ballads and more. We both also just want to say thanks to everyone for listening and sticking with us through difficult times, when the temptation would be to just switch off, so 'thanks everyone'.<hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

I don't think there's anything I could add to what James and I spoke at length about on Monday's Arsecast Extra. So, with that in mind we have something a little different for you today. Joining me to talk a little bit about Arsenal, but much more about himself, writing, the art of interviewing, what makes a good interview, books and lots more is the brilliant Donald McRae. I'm sure many of you read his interviews in the Guardian, or might well have enjoyed one of his 11 books – two of which have won the William Hill Sports Book of the Year award. We chat about growing up in South Africa, how he became an Arsenal fan, and lots more.<hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

We then touch on the 15th birthday of the site, left-backs and whether Luke Shaw might be an option this summer, some of the changes in the game for good and bad, and finish up by discussing which condiments and sauces are appropriate with chips.<hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

To get some differing perspectives on it, I'm joined by James from Gunnerblog, Daniel Storey from Football 365, chief football writer for the Independent Miguel Delaney, and the Man from East Lower. We talk about the manager, his future, the structures of the football club, the board, and pretty much every aspect of the situation. I also chat with Kurtis Powers from Arsenal NYC about a cool event involving Liam Brady, and as you might expect there's not a lot of the usual waffle under the circumstances.<hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

Episode 400 comes almost 10 years to the day since the very first Arsecast, so there's a bit of a look back with some moments from the last 10 years, a bit of reflection on how much has happened since then, and to talk about the football I welcome back to the very first Arsecast guest, Goodplaya, for a bit of a chat about all that. This Arsecast is absolutely full to the brim with waffle, usual and unusual. There's also a nice little competition in there for you too, and one day fantasy football with FanDuel.<hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

We also chat about his character, on and off the field, and how as football fans we have to shift our goalposts from time to time. We then answer some questions about Jamie Vardy, and about goalkeepers, before deciding that we'd pay a lot of money to keep eating a particular foodstuff.

Then we answer listener questions about Mesut Ozil who is a fish, the timing of this Interlull, Arsene Wenger, Lukaku, Xhaka, Aubameyang, and consider if we can sell a large inflatable object to Barcelona for £15m, amongst other things.<hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

I ask him how these Leicester players will be feeling, sitting top of the table; what Arsene Wenger's approach to the game will be to try and win but not fall into their counter-attacking trap; as well as what the manager will do in midfield and centre-half where he has selection decisions to make. I discuss Arsenal's summer trip to the USA, and there's all the usual space-based waffle in there too.<hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

We then answer listener questions, many of which are about Ozil; there's some Mathieu Debuchy gossip; we wax lyrical about our favourite signing from a Premier League club; and uncover the hidden meaning of Ozil's goal celebration hand signal. It's all in there.<hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

There isn't room for much of the usual waffle, but there's some – I wouldn't leave you without on the first show of the new season, and it all kicks off with a jaunty musical number.<hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.
