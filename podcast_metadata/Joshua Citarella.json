We breakdown the incentives of platforms to forecast what comes next.\n\nAt the end of this episode, we discuss a new project called A-Corps. A-Corps are a lightweight co-operative model for creatives. (TLDR: your band can be an artist co-op.) It’s not software — it’s law.

He is most well known for his 1992 work, \"The End of History & the Last Man\".\n\nDrawing on Hegel and Marx, Fukuyama explores the concept of teleology — the idea that history is a linear process where human societies progress through sequential socioeconomic forms. As Marx famously wrote, Feudalism was replaced by Capitalism and would ultimately be replaced by Socialism. But after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, Francis Fukuyama argued that western liberal democracy was the final form of human government. His thesis has been updated and revised many times since and remains a frequent subject of debate today.\n\nYou can get access to the full catalog for Doomscroll and more by becoming a paid supporter: www.patreon.com/joshuacitarella\njoshuacitarella.substack.com/subscribe",

I was amazed when he came back with an entirely new perspective on the Gateway saga and Monroe's connection to the military.

      "description": "Mike Pepi is the author of “Against Platforms”, a bold critique of the hidden costs of digital life – and a manifesto for a better future. He is also one of my best friends and someone I have been in conversation with for over a decade.\n\nIn this episode, we discuss our shared history in working to develop a new institutionalist critique of emerging technologies and platforms. The vast expansion of platforms during the 2010’s, which now encompass nearly all aspects of social life, represented a blindspot for the political left. To understand how this happened, we need to retrace the history of the 60’s counter-culture and the embrace of libertarian philosophies amongst the New Left.\n\nSince 2011, Mike Pepi, Brad Troemel, myself and other artists and writers have been engaged in an on-going dialogue that explores the ideological roots and design of platform technologies. Mike writes:\n\n“We have been taught that digital technologies are neutral tools, transparent, easily understood, and here to serve us. The reality, is that they are laden with assumptions and collateral consequences – ideology, in other words. And it is this hidden ideology that must be dismantled if we are to harness technology for the fullest expression of our humanity.”\n\nGet the book:\nhttps://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/761644/against-platforms-by-mike-pepi/",

      "description": "Otherworld presents Deep Research. This week, we’re covering “Tartaria”. Tartaria is a conspiracy theory that suggests the existence of a vast, advanced civilization that supposedly existed in ancient times but has been intentionally erased from historical records. Proponents of this theory often claim that Tartaria was a highly developed and technologically advanced empire with a global influence, surpassing the conventional understanding of history. They argue that evidence of Tartaria's existence is hidden or manipulated by a secretive global elite. The conspiracy theory often incorporates a variety of historical events, architectural anomalies, and symbols to support its narrative.Research links:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Tartaria/comments/wggxfa/itsmorganfr_on_tiktok_explaining_tartaria/\n\nhttps://www.cia.gov/readingroom/document/cia-rdp78-02771r000200090002-6\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@jonlevichannel\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@MindUnveiled\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/tartarianarchitecture/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Tartaria/\n\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@watch_the_rabbit_hole/video/7197053113310661890?lang=en\n\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@auntytateana2/video/7161746777069145350?lang=en\n\nhttps://youtu.be/4N-GDmlDMts?si=LH4ot7FLSsgzdd3Y\n\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@zacharydenman/video/7193705054363258117?lang=en\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-04-27/inside-architecture-s-wildest-conspiracy-theory\n\nhttps://youtu.be/dtU_M0Sjd9Y?si=LOds3f6Nj-KXktMQ&t=332\n\nFollow:\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/otherworldpod/?hl=enhttps://www.patreon.com/Otherworld",

Writers were instructed to copy/paste existing wikipedia entries and “play mad libs” with the nouns and dates. Drawing on movements from the past, these short stories recombine political history to anticipate long tail ideologies and factions that may soon emerge.\n\nChoose Your Future takes the hyperbolic imaginings of young people, raised on the internet, and puts their words directly into the mouths of content creators. In this way, the project emulates the signal amplification that occurs through social media, as radical takes move from the anonymous fringe into the verified mainstream. Is this the multi-faceted analysis of the Rand Corporation? Or is it a teenage meme poster who thinks it would be cool if these political keywords combined? I’m interested in the point where those spheres overlap.\n\nThis project combines the creative efforts of some of the artists, memers and content creators that have most inspired me over the past few years. Texts by: Margo Bergamini, Nick Bird, @ manletpill, David Noel, Abbey Pusz, D.Z. Rowan and Joshua Citarella. Read by: Caroline Busta, Mat Dryhurst, A.M. Gittlitz, Daniel Keller, Anna Khachiyan, Holly Herndon, Lil' Internet, Jack Wagner and Joshua Citarella.\n---\nOpen Secret is a six-month long online program exploring the role of the hidden in our apparently “open” society. Information technologies are supposed to increase our access to knowledge, making the world more legible, while undermining ignorance and superstition. But sometimes the feeling prevails that we have entered a new dark age of black boxes, projections, and paranoia. Techno-culture is obsessed with the unseen, the inaccessible, the known-unknown. Open Secret pursues things that are obscured–through artistic commissions, a suite of essays by leading thinkers, and an intensive public program dedicated to critical reappraisal of the digital infrastructures that organize civic life. With new contributions released on a monthly basis, the Open Secret website will bring together art, technology, politics, and new patterns of exchange.\n\nCurators: Nadim Samman, curator digital sphere, in collaboration with Katja Zeidler, head of education & mediation",
