This season, we delve into the story of Nikola founder Trevor Milton. He took his company Nikola to dizzying heights on the promise of a zero-emissions semi truck. At its peak, Nikola’s publicly traded stock was worth more than Ford—until a ragtag group of whistleblowers and short sellers revealed that Nikola and its truck wasn’t all that it seemed. This season on Bad Bets, Journal reporter Ben Foldy will tell the inside story of Trevor Milton’s rise and fall. You’ll hear exclusive interviews and recordings, and details from secret documents. And we’ll take you deep into Trevor Milton’s federal fraud trial, where he’s fighting the charges against him.\n\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",

He took a sleepy energy company and turned it into one of the most innovative corporations in the world. By the end, Enron had its fingers in all kinds of projects - including America's nascent broadband networks. In this episode, how Skilling's rise set the stage for Enron's fall.

      "description": "Introducing Bad Bets, a new podcast series from The Wall Street Journal that unravels big-business dramas that have had a big impact on our world. We begin with the Enron saga. In the 1990s, the U.S. energy company was a darling of Wall Street. But after the Journal uncovered monumental corporate fraud at Enron, the company quickly descended into bankruptcy, compromising tens of billions of dollars and thousands of jobs. Now, on the 20th anniversary of Enron's collapse, this story is as relevant as ever. This season on 'Bad Bets', Journal reporters John Emshwiller and Rebecca Smith talk to key players who witnessed Enron's downfall from the inside, including a whistleblower who speaks on the record for the first time. \n\nLearn more about your ad choices.
