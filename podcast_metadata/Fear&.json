So out of respect for our guests and their content we made the executive decision to not do a patreon episode this week so that we could also shoot an episode of their podcast with them immediately after ours! Hopefully you guys understand! The Fear& episode of Ive Had It should be out in the next couple days so go check that out when it drops, its about another hour of banger content.

      "description": "73 Episodes in feels like a good a time as any for a little switch up. The new set is here, it's real, it exists, it's not just a fairytale. Thank you so much to every one of you who has supported and watched us up until this point. I never could have imagined what this show would grow into when I first started producing it over a year ago with the Amsterdam episode. This show means so much to all of us and it would be nothing without our community.  A few words on the thought behind the new set and what you can expect moving forward: This set is meant to symbolize a little bit of the personality from each of our hosts. Stuff they loved growing up or that directly ties into their interests. Imagine what a room would look like if they all shared a bedroom growing up. We'll continue to add things and change things in it as we grow into the room. Dont worry, I know new things can be a little scary but this is very much still the same Fear&. It'll still be scuffed af from time to time, itll still be chaotic and make no sense, it'll still probably break every now and then. I hope yall fuck with it as much as we do. Also the old set is still there, this is likely not the last youve seen of it. Love ya enjoy the episode ok bye ♥✨ BONUS CONTENT ✨ PATREON - https://www.patreon.com/FearAnd🎧 AUDIO PLATFORMS - https://linktr.ee/fearand❤️ follow Fear&! ❤️Hasan: https://twitter.com/HasanthehunWill: https://twitter.com/TheWillNeffQT: https://twitter.com/QTCinderellaAustin: https://twitter.com/AustinontwitterMarche: https://twitter.com/MarcheFear&: https://twitter.com/FearAndPod00:00:00 - New set, same Fear&00:04:34 - Twitch made the depressed famous00:05:42 - New Twitch meta just dropped00:06:28 - \"I had a dream\" - AustinShow00:07:57 - Hasan ran downhill after a schoolbus00:09:16 - Austin dissapoint's Hasan's mom00:10:23 - Morgpie (biggus wombus)00:12:55 - Male's breakdown what matters00:14:15 - We need to hear the claps00:15:30 - Asianbunnyx the Rosa Parks of twitch00:16:50 - Is no one allowed to be riledup on twitch?00:18:30 - Innovation finds a way00:19:35 - AustinShow speaks on an unknown subject00:22:01 - Is the shaft of the d okay? 00:23:30 - Hasan has seen some nice roosters00:24:20 - Austin's weekends at Applebees00:26:32 - Chickfil-a is full of pride00:27:10 - Shohei Ohtani signs with Dodgers00:28:20 - \"Who cares about 200 million dollars\" - AustinShow00:29:46 - Ronnie joins the podcast00:31:30 - \"Japan is the capital of China\"00:33:07 - China agrees to become a colony of Bultimore00:35:30 - WillNeff needs a robot hotdog00:38:20 - Hotdog eating moneyshot 00:41:10 - Robot steak is the next big thing00:43:11 - We weren't at an hour...00:44:10 - Austin sets the flaking groundwork00:46:20 - Heartfelt message from a deeply caring fan00:48:00 - BONUS PATREON CONTENT YOU'RE WELCOME00:51:10 - Working it to a CRT TV is different00:54:00 - Stavros names a woman00:56:36 - Elon musk doesn't hurt cops\nLearn more about your ad choices.

The audio files were basically corrupt and sounded like garbage. Spent the last 24 hours after landing back in LA from Japan trying to salvage it and get it to a point that sounds listenable still, so that's why it's late and that's why it sounds a little weird at times. Super unlucky and super stressful, hopefully you all still enjoy this episode :( Sorry team. We're back from Japan!

      "description": "Hasan Piker (Outspoken LGBTQIA+ Foe) sits down with Austin Show (Gay) and Ludwig Ahgren (Questioning) to squash the beef and get to the root of what's really going on here. No Will this week unfortunately. Hasan got insecure about how hard Will's tiktok is blowing up and cut him from the podcast. I'm worried I might be next..  Anyway topics for today's episode include, irl streaming, lying to the federal government, c&amp;bt, youtube pranksters.🎧 AUDIO PLATFORMS - https://linktr.ee/fearand🐥follow our guests!🐤Ludwig: https://twitter.com/LudwigAhgrenAustin: https://twitter.com/AustinOnTwitter🐤follow the boys!🐥Fear&: https://twitter.com/FearAndPodHasan: https://twitter.com/HasanthehunWill: https://twitter.com/TheWillNeffMarche: https://twitter.com/MarchePatreon: https://www.patreon.com/fearand\nLearn more about your ad choices.
