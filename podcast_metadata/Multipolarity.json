What had shocked was that, unlike the standard communist bloc military parades, with their thousands of Soviet-style tanks and armoured personnel carriers and well trained goose-steppers, this one showcased weaponry that could have come from a science fiction film: mobile, directed energy laser weapons; hypersonic glide vehicles; futuristic looking, fighter jet sized, loyal wingmen stealth drones; robot wolves; space defence systems.</p><p>But was it real, or just a Potemkin arsenal driving past the Forbidden City? And if they were real, what do these things actually do? What do they mean for the balance of power in the western pacific? And, finally, as China climbs at breakneck speed up the military tech ladder, what does it mean for Washington's efforts to hold its defensive perimeter at the first Island Chain?</p><p>Anybody interested in China's military tech, and especially its military aviation, will know TP Huang, an invaluable provider of detailed analysis on Beijing's ever greater military arsenal, and China's Beijing's technological progress more generally. He joins us for a special interview with Andrew.&nbsp;</p><p>Multipolarity dialogues is a series of interview that scan the geopolitical horizon.

Magical Money Tree.&nbsp;</p><p>Whichever name you know it by, everywhere, these days, the intellectual salons hum with people trying to say that they’ve invented that most terrifying of things: a new paradigm. That they have the economic equivalent of Einsteinian Relativity.&nbsp;</p><p>These people profess that debt is no issue. That a country that prints its own currency can’t go broke. And rather, that by a canny toe-heel on the brakes, countries can juice their economies without slamming into a wall.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This week, after talking around the topic on any number of previous episodes, we’re tackling MMT head-on, in an hour long special edition.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Andy Collingwood is grilling Philip Pilkington, who claims to have been there at the birth of modern monetary theory in 2013 — and asking him whether there is much more here than a placenta, some hair and three teeth.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The answer, it transpires, is yes and no. MMT does indeed represent a new vein of insight. But that insight is only partial. Misapplied, it is as catastrophic to a monetary system as liquid Robert Mugabe.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>So join us, on a journey, to a magical money tree <em>not</em> so far away…</p><p>You can get special paywalled premium episodes of Multipolarity every month on Patreon: https://patreon.com/multipolarity</p>",

The standoff continues. </p><p>Meanwhile, in the tiny breakaway relic of the Bosnian War, Republika Srpska, the crossroads has come to a fork.</p><p>In February 2025, the President of the RS region of Bosnia, Milorad Dodik, was stripped of his office, for planning to hold an independence referendum to break away from Bosnia. He was handed a one-year prison sentence plus a six-year political ban. Christian Schmidt, Bosnia’s High Representative, froze budgetary support for RS ruling parties after attempts to arrest Dodik were thwarted by Republika Srpska police. </p><p>Two concurrent crises, oddly twinned: as we all know, when Serbia goes off, the world needs to stand well back. </p><p>Miša Đurković is head of the MCC-MKI Center for Geopolitics at the School of International Relations at MCC.&nbsp;.

Open Source satellite pictures of the Fordow site show six ominous black holes in two, tightly clustered groups of three, into which deep-penetration bunker buster bombs were dropped. The entire strike package got in and out entirely unmolested.</p><p>But was Iran's nuclear programme really destroyed? There are suggestions that Iran moved its highly enriched uranium from the Fordow site some days before the US attack. If it was such a devastating blow, why has Iran not responded? US Bases and Gulf energy infrastructure is far closer, and far easier to strike than Israel, which Iran is still pounding.</p><p>And was Iran a paper tiger? So beset by corruption and ill discipline that Israel could establish air supremacy in a single night, and US air assets can roam the skies with impunity? So that it could have its entire nuclear programme destroyed in a week? That it would be too afraid to strike back, lest the US escalate further.&nbsp;</p><p>What was real at all?

      "description": "<p>Last weekend, Viktor Orbán travelled to the town of Băile Tușnad, deep in the Transylvanian mountains of Romania, to attend a 'music and ideas' festival. </p><p>He was on the bill. </p><p>Amongst the ethnically-Hungarian diaspora who live in the region, Orbán is a regular visitor. In fact, the Tusványos festival was started by Fidesz back when the party was effectively four people. That was in the early-90s. Today, it has swelled to accommodate over 10 000 people. </p><p>The place is billed as an 'open university', with talks by a range of academics, thinkers and politicians. </p><p>Traditionally, Orbán gives his own 'series of lectures' , just like many of others speakers. The difference is that Orbán speaks from the main stage, in front of a crowd of a few thousand. </p><p>In recent years, these speeches have become philosophical key notes to understanding the Hungarian perspective. In previous years, his talks have made world headlines, including the one where he said he regarded Hungary as an 'illiberal democracy' (though this was partly mis-translation). </p><p>Rarely does a world leader get as philosophical as Orbán does in these talks. He lays out a deep vision of the future as he sees it for the upcoming year, one that connects history, economics, and metaphysics. </p><p>This year's speech was among the deepest - and the spiciest -ever. Not only did it catch the headlines, with its barbs against Poland, and naming US intelligence as the saboteurs of the Nordstream pipeline, it could even justifiably be called 'historic'. Orbán talked openly of Hungary's coming pivot to China, of the decay of the Western soul, and of the shape of the peace that must come beyond the Russo-Ukraine War. </p><p>Gladden Pappin is the President of the Hungarian Institute of International Affairs. A prominent academic and leading light in the post-liberal movement, Pappin is perhaps one of the hidden architects of Hungary's dynamic foreign policy. </p><p>This week, The Lads ask him about the deeper meaning of  Orbán's Big Talk. </p><p>***</p><p>Be excellent to each other, and -</p><p><br /></p><p>Get us on Twitter.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqa1FJbGN0dTJ6SUJKZU5rVmZQMmU2SjE5U0NXd3xBQ3Jtc0trck1FaXN4Ui1ZUU1qV3pJY0dvMENJMkxMSk8zbzZvWFJRX1NvZFYzR3RGUGcyQWhWbEJ1Z1Jsa0pFYl82SGJDZjJUdnRQX203bGxIWlhGOGQ1Y2UzQmsxZ1V2WU9jZ2JaQm1zMkNhQ3Uzdk1LQkxFRQ&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.x.com%2Fmultipolarity&amp;v=ZTVvHMhmno4\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.x.com/multipolarity</a></p><p><br /></p><p>On Patreon.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>https<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqa1lzR015VjR2YUwwQUNSMldQTWE4eGtlVjJZZ3xBQ3Jtc0trQjF5TnByMDhNT3F1WXZXUjJOb01HQkUtOTU3azFaT001a252TERZXzRJS3lTMVN4WGZnWnp3dGkwMHdlV1EzYk9NYi04ZVJYLTNqNFpVWWVyMUwwanFmRGEtdFpVV0xFdk1XcV84RDRreU9UTHBSZw&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.patreon.com%2Fmultipolarity&amp;v=ZTVvHMhmno4\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">://www.patreon.com/multipolarity&nbsp;&nbsp;</a></p><p><br /></p><p>Or on our Substack.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p><a href=\"https://substack.com/@multipolaritypod\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://substack.com/@multipolaritypod</a></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p>",

      "description": "<p>At 4.32pm on the 18th of August the so-called State Committee on the State of Emergency cut the lines of communication to Soviet President Mikhail Gorbacev's dacha - these included telephone communications and the nuclear command and control system.</p><p>Eight minutes later Lieutenant General Yuri Plekhanov, Head of the 9th Chief Directorate of the KGB, let the group into the dacha where they demanded that Gorbachev either declare a state of emergency in the Soviet Union or resign.</p><p><br /></p><p>The previous month twelve Soviet public figures, mostly artists but also some politicians and military officials, signed a letter entitled 'A Word to the People' in the anti-perestroika newspaper Sovetskaya Rossiya. The letter was drafted by the writer Alexander Prokhanov. </p><p><br /></p><p>\"An enormous, unforeseen calamity has taken place,\" it told readers, \"Motherland, our land, a great power, given to us to ward with the nature, glorious ancestors, it is perishing, breaking apart, falling into darkness and nonbeing.\"</p><p><br /></p><p>On July 10th 2024, the actor, director and film producer George Clooney published an essay in The New York Times entitled 'I Love Joe Biden. But We Need a New Nominee'. </p><p><br /></p><p>\"The one battle [Biden] cannot win is the fight against time,\" Clooney wrote, \"None of us can. It’s devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe “big F-ing deal” Biden of 2010. He wasn’t even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\"</p><p><br /></p><p>Where Prokhanov's letter was infused with Soviet patriotism, Clooney's was shot through with party loyalty. Prokhanov pleaded with Soviet leaders to save the Soviet Union; Clooney pleaded with Biden to save the Democratic Party. Yet the functional outcome was the same: a coup - of sorts.</p><p><br /></p><p>Less than two weeks later, on the 21st of July, President Biden issued a letter stating that he would not run for president again in 2024. Everyone knew that Biden had written this against his own will. Some accepted that he had simply caved under pressure, others whispered of a backroom deal or even threats.</p><p><br /></p><p>Gorbachev survived his coup attempt, although afterwards he faded into the background as the new President of Russia Boris Yeltsin came to the fore. The coup attempt definitively sped up the dissolution of the Soviet Union, however, precisely the opposite of what the plotters had intended.</p><p><br /></p><p>Likewise, the coup against Biden will likely speed up the collapse of the Democratic Party in the United States. The leaders of this party told the American people that Biden was capable of doing his job but now, after the coup, they have tacitly admitted that he is not. This is an obvious breach of trust - and one that voters will be unlikely to forgive.</p><p><br /></p><p>But what does it matter? The collapse of a political party is nothing compared to the collapse of a great power like the Soviet Union. Another political party, perhaps. But just as the Communist Party of the Soviet Union was until 1991 the party of the state, so too is the Democratic Party of today.</p><p><br /></p><p>The Democratic Party in 2024 is the skeleton of the American ruling elite. Without it, this elite collapses into a gelatinous heap. Can the American state function without its party? Can the current world system survive if the American state starts to falter? These are questions that will be answered in the following 18 months - they are questions that are now being asked across America and the world in response to this very American coup.</p><p><br /></p><p>*** </p><p><br /></p><p>Be excellent to each other, and -</p><p><br /></p><p>Get us on Twitter.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p><a...",

Media consultants, political strategists, whatever title they assume they always promise the same thing: magic worked through information control; spells cast by incantation.</p><p><br /></p><p>In the first week of March 2022, only a few days after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, a slew of articles came out in Western publications announcing the advent of the anti-Russian infowar.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>To say that this infowar was launched with much fanfare would be an understatement - within days of the Russo-Ukraine war beginning various Western publications were already suggesting that victory was on the horizon.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>The effect was eerie, with multiple outlets running the exact same headline. \"Ukraine is winning the information war against Russia\", proclaimed different writers at CNBC, Slate, and The Financial Times.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>No doubt this proclamation of victory was itself part of the infowar that the various authors purported to analyse - a self-licking ice cream cone if there ever was one.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Yet as time went on it became clear that the anti-Russian infowar was not targeted at the Russian people, much less the Russian military - rather it was targeted at a Western domestic audience.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>The French philosopher Jean Baudrillard once declared that The Gulf War Did Not Take Place - it was merely broadcast as a sort of simulation on television screens across the world. If only Baudrillard had lived to see the anti-Russian infowar launched in early-2022.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Partisan politics in the United States had long been drowned in a bathtub of propaganda by the time the anti-Russian infowar came along.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>As the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal raged in 1998, the American public asked themselves whether the President did or did not have sexual relations with that woman. The question was a factual one: did he or didn't he. Today such a reference to reality seems quaint.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>The factuality of various political attacks barely matters anymore as everything is treated as being part of some partisan \"narrative\" or \"talking point\".</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>And so, when some people raised the possibility that President Joe Biden might be completely incapable of doing his job due to severe cognitive impairment, the factuality of this claim was never really addressed - it was simply dismissed as an obvious partisan attack, a \"right-wing talking point\".</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Last week we saw reality climb back in through the window: the President tried to debate his opponent on television and the world saw that America is being led by a man who is clearly not in command of his faculties.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>In this week's episode of Multipolarity, we are joined by Malcolm Kyeyune to discuss the saturation of the information space with propaganda of various forms.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Are these really the savvy tricks that consultants and strategists claim them to be?

An extended sketch on the possibilty of  violent Trussification. He thinks that bond market bullying of the incoming Trump administration could in turn set off a chain of events, that demand a new wave of de-dollarisation.</p><p>    </p><p>In Part Two, Andrew Collingwood flips the perspective from West to East, and from currency wars, to trade wars.         </p><p>He’ll be looking at the world from China’s point of view, in the light of this week’s US trade tariffs on Chinese goods - including a one hundred percent tariff on Chinese electric vehicles.    </p><p>The Chinese have studied how nations rise, and they’ve come up with a plan to leapfrog US in the technological pecking order. As the low tariff liberal Washington order slips away, what becomes of a world where China is no longer content with low and medium-value manufacturing, but is instead actively targetting the crowning heights that America has long claimed as its unique domain? </p><p>*** </p><p><br /></p><p>For more on the Chinese plan, be sure to subscribe to Multipolarity’s new Substack, where Andrew will be putting down some extended thoughts. </p><p><br /></p><p>This week, we also have an introductory essay - called What Is Multipolarity? </p><p><br /></p><p>And from next week, every Thursday we’ll have the Multipolarity Briefing - a series of links and brief thoughts to keep you up to date on the latest multipolar developments. </p><p><br /></p><p>Simply search for Multipolarity on Substack.com</p><p><br /></p><p>*** </p><p><br /></p><p>Be excellent to each other, and -</p><p>Get us on Twitter: https://www.twitter.com/multipolarpod</p><p>On Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/multipolarity </p><p>Or on our Substack: https://substack.com/@multipolaritypod</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p> </p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>          </p><p><br /></p><p>  </p>",

So says Malcolm Kyeyune in a recent essay ruminating on the American journalist Tucker Carlson's recent visit to Moscow where he famously - or, perhaps, infamously - purchased a burger at Russia's new McDonald's clone, 'Tasty, that's it'.&nbsp;</p><p>Kyeyune sees Carlson's culinary adventure as reminiscent of Mikhail Gorbachev's decision to do an advert in which Russians would debate whether the fall of the Evil Empire was worth the introduction of fast food chains. Now the shoe is on the other foot, with Carlson highlighting how cheap food is in Russia in comparison to the United States, plagued, as is the rest of the West, with a cost of living crisis.</p><p><br /></p><p>But this latest fast food fight is really only the tip of the iceberg lettuce. Since the pandemic of 2020, a feeling of malaise has crept into the West. The feeling is palpable and encompasses everything from rising costs of basic necessities to a feeling that the culture is spiralling out of control to a questioning of our basic modus operandi - what happened, some ask, to our freedoms?</p><p><br /></p><p>In this week's episode we want to discuss whether the West is spiralling into chaos? It feels like a lot of narratives are breaking down right now, and one crisis seems to open onto another like a Matryoshka doll. With a highly controversial election on the horizon in November and the Biden Administration having failed to deliver on its promise of normality, is our ideological Berlin Wall starting to crumble?</p><p><br /></p><p>*** </p><p><br /></p><p>Please like, subscribe, and be excellent to each other.</p><p><a href=\"https://Twitter.com/multipolaritypod\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Twitter</strong></a></p><p><a href=\"https://Patreon.com/multipolarity\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Patreon</strong></a></p>",

Be they at the State Department, the Pentagon, CIA, other parts of the Federal government, or think tanks, they have been tasked with projecting the global power of the world’s greatest empire. </p><p><br /></p><p>They make the decisions. Someone has to. </p><p><br /></p><p>And just as France has its Enarques. Or China has its unique mandarin examinations, the Foreign Policy bureaucracy of America have a common culture, a particular education, and a singular mindset. Yet it is so common, so super-dominant in our Western world, we seldom think to question its priors. </p><p><br /></p><p>This week, we’re lucky to be joined by the very model of the modern wonk-general. Carlos Roa. &nbsp;A Contributing Editor at&nbsp;<em>The National Interest, </em>he was formerly the Executive Editor of the publication. He was Associate Editor of&nbsp;<em>Horizons: Journal of International Relations and Sustainable Development</em>&nbsp;and an analyst at the Center for International Relations and Sustainable Development. </p><p><br /></p><p>He knows DC from many different vantage points. </p><p><br /></p><p>We wanted to use his experience of being an insider to chart the anthropology of the Washington Deep State. To talk about what it is to be part of the Washington power elite - how you get started. What schools you go to. What parties you go to. Who you meet and the fundaments of the shared world view they regurgitate to each other. </p><p><br /></p><p>This episode is a Rake’s Progress, if you will.<em> How To Get Ahead In DC</em>, who you ned to step on, who you step round, to get to the top of the totem pole.</p><p><br /></p><p>***</p><p><strong>For the full expanded edition, 90 minutes with Carlos, get us on Patreon: </strong></p><p><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/94647483\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>https://www.patreon.com/posts/94647483</strong></a></p>",

Our duo argue the toss: is this just bad accounting? Or is there something more fundamental here, to do with how a different kind of bad accounting has allowed the UK to obscure its long-term decline for far too long? </p><p>On a related point, Philip Pilkington has been dodging brickbats all week, after he told UnHerd readers that the problem of housing expense may not be all a question of bad planning laws limiting supply. Why, he asks, is this also the case in territories with such different planning and demographics situations as New Zealand, Hungary and Japan? Patiently, he re-explains his argument to Andrew Collingwood. </p><p>Finally, one Chinese province has repealed its Houkoo Laws. These are the communist diktats that forbid citizens from moving beyond their home province.

A new metric, from the world-leading science journal Nature has put Chinese universities above some of the most famous names in higher ed. MIT, Caltech, Cambridge and Imperial are all ranking lower than the likes of Nanjing and Tsinghua. </p><p>Andrew Collingwood is interested in how far behind the times our cultural imagination is with regards to China. While Philip Pilkington senses that the gains to being world-best will soon start to turn exponential. Both are mildly baffled as to how we've come up with a ranking system that doesn't prioritise innovative research. </p><p>With China already producing more STEM PhDs than the US, is the Western university still fit for purpose? </p><p>In Germany, years of pacifism won't be shucked off as easily as Russian shelling of Kiev. The country's incoming coalition government had threatened to raise the national budget. Instead, its defence minister has had to content himself with 'not having the budget cut'. So is Germany's long-held pacifism turning pathological? Or will they wake up to a multipolar world before it's too late? </p><p>Meanwhile, it's Iran Nuclear Deal season again. After Trump tore up the Obama era plan, and Biden then won re-election promising to put it back, the going has not been slow.  For now, the Iranians are continuing to enrich their party packs of uranium. And in a multipolar world, there is no longer so much that the Americans can offer them to stop. </p><p>The decisive turn, as Philip Pilkington notes, may come from Israel. As alliances swirl, will they continue their targeted assassinations of top scientists? Or is there even a world in which they come down on the side of the mullahs? </p>",

Philip Pilkington sees two big takeaways from this $500 billion barrel of pork. First: the return of real dirigiste industrial policy to America. Secondly: the advent of Big Green as a powerful lobbying force on Capitol Hill. </p><p>Meanwhile, Andrew Collingwood has been watching Lula enter through the Beijing door that Macron just exited - bearing a similar amount of fresh deals and good cheer from President Xi. As they watch China build out Brazil's 5G network, will there, he wonders, be a sniff of buyers' regret from the 'Manhattan charity auction set' for having backed a Chomskyite old-Marxist over the more unpalatable, yet much more US-friendly, Jair Bolsonaro? </p>",

Who wins what, and how do we keep the fragile world order together? </p><p>Before he'd touched down in Paris from his China trip, Emmanuel Macron was back on manoeuvres. He gave an airborne interview to Politico in which he laid out a much more Sino-centric view of the coming order. One that had little time for the US line on Taiwan. What is he playing at? Philip Pilkington reckons this one may end up being 'the story of the year'. </p><p>And then there's the rare earths. They're in everything now. And 85 per cent of them come from China.

Now that the spectre of great power warfare has returned, it's not clear they have the right tanks and the right guns to take on a China that is going hammer-and-tongs for more materiel. </p><p>Finally, Hungarians have kept warm this winter by engaging in strategic ambiguities over Ukraine.
