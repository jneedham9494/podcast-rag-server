He tells us about a band of West Bank settlers attacking him and locals in the olive fields of Turmus’ayya, including an old woman who was beaten unconscious on camera. He then talks about the Israeli military and intelligence’s response to the crime, the footage actually breaking through to the mainstream Anglophone press, and various U.S. Senators’ response to the attack. Finally, he closes with speculation about Trump and Netanyahu’s refusal to sign on to an official West Bank annexation.\n\nFollow Jasper’s substack: https://substack.com/@infinitejaz\nFollow Jasper on Twitter: https://x.com/infinite__jaz?lang=en\nFollow Jasper on Insta: https://www.instagram.com/infinite_jaz/?hl=en\n\nAnd links for Volunteering in the West Bank: \n\nTo volunteer in the West Bankhttps://palsolidarity.org/join-ism/https://www.defendpalestine.orghttps://cjnv.orgFundraiser for Umm Al-Khair as it faces impending demolition: https://secure.everyaction.com/LYmVAbNl2UOxgBcaP1mkFA2",

Spooky season is upon us and to inaugurate another edition of Ghoulvie Screamset Horrortober, Will Massacre and Hexa Deni are back with a selection of abominable and morally ruinous films.\n\nFirst up, in Return of the Living Dead (O’Bannon, 1985) an assortment of punks, working stiffs and slobs accidentally expose themselves to zombie gas and help bring out the nuclear bombing of Louisville, Kentucky in this documentary about a real thing that actually happened. This hilarious and goofball horror film asks two existentially terrifying questions: What if you could feel every second of being dead? And, do you want to PARTY????\n\nThen in The Blob (Russell, 1988), a sci fi classic gets a grisly and unforgettable remake that features Kevin Dillon playing an motorcycle riding bad boy who smokes cigs, wears a leather jacket and has to save the small town that rejects him for being too cool from a giant blob that digests and dissolves everything in its path.\n\nThis episode is free, but the rest of Ghoulvie Screamset Season 3 will be paywalled!",

In the past 20+ years, though, we’ve seen a shift in how the right responds to climate catastrophes — including building out a robust selection of conspiracy theories from chemtrails to Flat Earth. Will Menaker from Chapo Trap House joins us to discuss right-wing conspiracy theories about the weather, the climate, and whether we’re living on a discworld.\n\nOur guest is Will Menaker, host of Chapo Trap House.

We recap the Groyper War that preceded the assassination and the pressure it put on Kirk to move right, as well as the conspiracies surrounding his shooting. Was Israel involved? Why was there no exit wound? Did Charlie have a late-in-life conversion to Catholicism? And which faction of the right will be able to define the man’s legacy?\n\nFollow Will Sommer on Twitter/X: https://x.com/willsommer",

Thousands of children died attempting to cut their own limbs off and suspend them from midair. All that changed when Solid Snake was brought into the third dimension.\n\nBrendan and Felix kick off their journey through the greatest story ever told by surfacing onto Shadow Moses. This is where Solid Snake realized he could be more than just a paid killer, Meryl Silverburgh witnessed the ugly reality of war, Roy Campbell was promoted from uncle to father, and Liquid Snake didn’t actually achieve much of anything besides scoring some sunglasses off of a former member of his dad’s love triangle.\n\nPut on your sneaking suit, let some strange woman shoot some crap into your arm, and soak your cardboard boxes in urine.

We also discuss Sam’s recent debate appearances including the “vs. 20 Conservatives” video, and how it’s not the stupidity but the confidence that’s really astounding. Finally, for the main course for today’s ep, the massive profile on John Fetterman’s deteriorating mental competence, and how the most offensive part of the scandal is the staffers who covered for him now seeking to cover their own asses.\n\nCheck out Sam on The Majority Report, every Mon-Fri at noon: https://www.youtube.com/@TheMajorityReport",

To listen to the rest of the season, subscribe at www.patreon.com/chapotraphouse\n\nWhen you love movies, you’ve got to watch them. There’s no other way…Movie Mindset Season 3 commences with our first ever single feature on the most referenced movie in Chapo Trap House history: Martin Scorsese’s masterpiece Casino. Will and Hesse are joined by Felix to take a kaleidoscopic and dizzying dive into the inferno of American greed that is Las Vegas. Anchored by a triumvirate of all career great performances from Robert De Niro, Sharon Stone and Joe Pesci in FULL PSYCHO MODE, Casino is by equal turns hilarious and stomach turning and stands alone as Scorsese’s grandest and most generous examination of evil and the tragic flaws that doom us all. \n\nShould you listen even if you haven’t seen this movie?\nWhy take a chance?

Plus, what was actually in the gift bags given by Hamas to the freed Israeli hostages.\n\nIf you’re looking for ways to help, this is from Mohammad: More importantly, this is a good place people can donate to. This started out as a small soup kitchen set up by the family of a friend after their home was destroyed and his brother killed. Over the past year they've expanded to several soup kitchens, water trucks, small clinics and a couple of classrooms. The other brother who was running it was killed on his way to deliver supplies to Kamal Adwan hospital last month. They've done so much good work in helping people stay especially in northern Gaza:\n\nhttps://www.gofundme.com/f/Hot-meals-in-gaza-daily?viewupdates=1&rcid=r01-173283450269-b9a1b078addc11ef",

The Fog is a true American ghost story wrestling with monstrous crimes of our past, and Halloween III is an outrageous gorefest with one of the most infamously ludicrous plots in all horror cinema. Tom Atkins plays an everyman sex symbol in both, laying pipe as he’s terrorized by ghosts & robots through anonymous northern California towns.\n\nNote: Will promised we’d timestamp the Tom Atkins Ass Shot in the description.

We also touch on James Rebhorn’s character in Independence Day, slipping on banana peels, and the best and worst of Olympic sports.\n\nPart 1 of the REFORM!

Despite Biden recently bragging he’s leaving office with the U.S. not involved in any foreign conflicts, the U.S. now has sanctions in place in over a third of all nations around the world, including more than 60% of “developing” nations. Jeff walks us through this increasingly central policy of worldwide economic coercion, how it shapes American imperial aims, and some intended & unintended consequences of the exponential expansion of sanctions in the 21st century. Then, we take a quick look at the state of the Veepstakes, Josh Shapiro’s whole deal, and of course, RFK Jr. and the road-kill bear.\n\nCheck out Jeff’s sanctions investigation here: https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/interactive/2024/us-sanction-countries-work/",

When capricious 86-year-old owner and founder “King” George Coulam attempts to retire, his underlings, the obsequious & loyal-to-a-fault Jeff and the ambitious & conniving Louie, are pitted against each other in their attempts to gain control of the park. It’s a darkly comedic real-life Shakespeare story, but it also touches on a lot of ideas about work, employment, ownership, power, performance, alienation, and an (unhealthy?) obsession with the past, all in the context of a very particular modern workplace.\n\nAll three episodes of Ren Faire are available now to stream on Max (the place for HBO).",

      "description": "Welcome to Movie Mindset season 2! Will & Hesse look at two films somewhat bookending the career of the great James Cagney: Lloyd Bacon’s Footlight Parade (1933) & Billy Wilder’s One, Two, Three (1961). The first is a pre-code musical spectacular, allowing Cagney to show off his song and dance skills as a promoter of live “prologues” for movie houses, the later a cold war screwball comedy, together they show the insane range of Cagney across a career also notable for roles as gangsters and tough guys. But here, we get to see his work making the most racist and offensive musical numbers imaginable to a depression-era crowd, and joke-a-minute comedy chops as a beverage exec trying to keep his boss’s daughter from eloping with a Communist while opening up east Germany to the wonders of Coca-Cola. \n\nTickets to Will & Hesse’s Movie Mindset screening & talkback of Death Wish 3 in NYC on May 4: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/chapo-trap-houses-movie-mindset-screening-of-death-wish-3-w-will-hesse-tickets-877569192077",

      "description": "In a more serious episode, we talk to author and journalist Nick Bryant about his 2009 book “The Franklin Scandal: A Story of Powerbrokers, Child Abuse & Betrayal.” We’ve mentioned the Franklin Credit Union scandal in passing on the show before, but it begins with the collapse of the Franklin Credit Union in Omaha, Nebraska in 1988 due to rampant corruption and embezzlement of its manager, Lawrence E. King, Jr. Soon after, King was accused, along with GOP lobbyist Craig Spence, of orchestrating a massive child prostitution ring, shuttling minors between Omaha and D.C., and using their solicitation to blackmail high ranking political figures. Bryant’s work examines the evidence behind this, and we discuss the scandal, the victims, the cover up, intelligence agency connections of its perpetrators, and the crucial links between intelligence-led sexual political blackmail operations of the past with the Epstein case today.\n\nFollow Nick on Twitter here: @nick__bryant\nFind more info, Nick’s book and Nick’s blog on his website here: nickbryantnyc.com",

We discuss the effects of a tight labor market on labor power, what’s at stake in the strike, and how the current “vibe” of labor militancy might affect future strikes. We then look at the other end of capital with a piece from FT detailing the “vibe” at the Milken Jamboree, an event named after the “junk bond king” headlined by, of course, Bari Weiss.\n\nCheck out Jonah’s writing in Labor Notes: https://labornotes.org/author/5777/content\n\nAnd sign up for his newsletter here: https://whogetsthebird.substack.com/",

Then, after one of Will’s maybe sweatiest ever transitions, we move on to discussing the tragic Miami condo collapse and the narrowing aperture of improvement in American life. Finally, we read from two accounts of the last days of the Trump Administration, confirming a lot of what we suspected, and adding a few more juicy details of what Trump, Rudy and the gang were actually up to on Jan. 6. Also there’s a little bonus segment on “Woke Capitalism” and the future of “Trumpism” as a political project at the end.",

We’re joined by our Women’s correspondent Katherine Krueger who takes the popular TikTok trend “Questions for Boys” and applies it to the Dry Boys. We then turn to the National Review to ask why conservatives are suddenly so gaga about the Royal Family. Finally, we see if we can find common ground with Boss Ross Douthat about getting Americans horny.\n\nSMASH that preorder button for Amber’s new book: https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250269621\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO DISCOURSE BLOG: get 30% off a new annual subscription to Discourse Blog at discourseblog.com/subscribe with code BIRTHDAY on Tuesday",

It’s a documentary cautioning against the dangers of populist extremism, featuring the sober, reasonable analysis of James Baker, Leon Panetta, Rahm Emanuel, Alan Greenspan and Larry Summers, among others, and is honestly just as wild and deranged as You Me Madness. This completes a kind of inadvertent trilogy of films exploring inside the dream world from the POV of the middle class (Can’t Get You Out of My Head), the wealthy cultural elites (You Me Madness) and now, economic-political elite (Stars and Strife)",
