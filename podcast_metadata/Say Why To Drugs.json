Suzi Gage headed to Suffolk and was joined by previous SWTD guest Fiona Spargo-Mabbs. Their discussion covered all aspects of how to talk with your family about drugs - what age should discussions happen? How do teens want these conversations to happen? How honest should parents be about their experience, or lack of it, with drugs?</p><br /><p>Fiona Spargo-Mabbs is the founder of the DSM Foundation, and has recently published a fantastic and powerful book called I Wish I'd Known, about her son Dan's death after taking MDMA, and all the things she wishes she - and Dan - had been aware of, in terms of evidence-based information about substances, why teenagers behave the ways that they do, along with advice about how to navigate conversations.</p><p>https://www.dsmfoundation.org.uk/more-information-for-parents/i-wish-id-known-fionas-book/</p><br /><p>And here is the previous episode she appeared on:</p><p>https://play.acast.com/s/saywhytodrugs/drugeducation-withthedsmfoundation</p><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

In the first episode of a new little run, Suzi speaks to epidemiologists Dr Kate Fleming and Dr Luisa Zuccolo about what we know about the evidence around the risks of drinking alcohol during pregnancy. How do they compare to other things women are advised against doing, like smoking, or eating soft cheese? Why does alcohol seem to be so divisive an issue in pregnancy? We also talk about plans to keep better records about alcohol use in pregnancy, and how this got somewhat misreported in the media in recent weeks. <hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

Happy birthday to Say Why To Drugs the booook, Happy book-day to me!</p><br /><p>Luckily for you I decided against singing that in the intro to this episode, but I'm VERY excited to say that today is the day that Say Why to Drugs the book launches in the UK, and online. It's taken me the last 2 years to write, and so it's such a weird and lovely feeling for it to be finally available for you to read.</p><br /><p>Or to listen to! I've recorded the audiobook, which is also released today, and the lovely people at Hodder and Stoughton have said I can share a few excerpts with you all! So we have an amazing Foreword written by none other than Scroobius PIp - he goes in to detail about how the podcast came to be, how he and I ended up working together on it, and generally being very lovely and flattering and supportive, thanks Pip. The book also has a load of mini chapters about various concepts surrounding drugs and their use - the next excerpt is one of these, about comedowns. And finally the myths and misconceptions from the 'caffeine' chapter.</p><br /><p>I hope you enjoy it. If you want to buy the book, it's available from a variety of places.

Dr Sally Adams joins the podcast again, Professor Harry Sumnall from Liverpool John Moores University guests, as well as Chris Torpey, the editor of local magazine Bido Lito and an organiser of Liverpool Psych Fest, and Guy McKnight, the singer in 00's band 80s Matchbox B-Line Disaster, and now in band the DSM-IV. The conversation covers whether music and drugs are cultural essentials, why musicians might be particularly at risk of problematic substance use, how music is used to sell legal drugs, whether drugs impact on creativity, and takes questions from the audience. <hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

Adam and Suzi have a wide-ranging discussion in this episode of Say Why to Drugs, that takes in why Adam wanted to become first a musician, then a psychotherapist, whether musicians might be particularly at risk of developing poor mental health or substance use problems, and why that might be.
